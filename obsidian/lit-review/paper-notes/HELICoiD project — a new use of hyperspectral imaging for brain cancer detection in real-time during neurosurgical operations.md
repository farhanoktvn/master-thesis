## Gist
HSI based cancer detection system. High accuracy between normal and tumour tissues


## Data
- 400—1000nm and 900—1700nm(NIR)


## Preprocessing
- Image calibration
- Noise and band reduction and normalisation


## Learning Process
- RF, MLP and SVM
- k-fold cross validation


## Evaluation
- RF got the highest accuracy folllowed by MLP then SVM
- Visible to NIR performed better than only NIR
- Methods: accuracy, specificity, sensitivity
