> I have looked on pubmed for “multispectral imaging”, “hyperspectral imaging”, multispectral analysis” and “hyperspectral analysis”

> You should cross-checked if I got all the papers with those keywords on multiple databases (Web of Science, etc.) and try different ones  

> Would recommend “multispectral imaging neurosurgery”, “multispectral imaging surgery”, “hyperspectral imaging neurosurgery”, “hyperspectral imaging surgery”, “multispectral analysis + same words as above”
