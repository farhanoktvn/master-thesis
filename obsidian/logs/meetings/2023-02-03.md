## Project Plan
- Project plan will be finalised in the upcoming days
- Goal: Semantic segmentation using M/HSI
- Possible hurdles:
	- Surface occlusion from bodily fluids
	- Limited dataset quantity
	- Sensitivity to subject and environmental condition

## Literature Review
- There is an ongoing literature review conducted by Dr Giulio on the use of M/HSI
- Current search terms:
	- multispectral medical surgery
	- hyperspectral medical surgery
- Additional search terms will be used for cross-reference
- Search terms will be focused more on the application of M/HSI in neurosurgery
