## Activities
- Data Exploration
- Visualising the segmented area

## Segmentation
- Tissues and objects are segmented
- Might need a mask to omit unlabeled data
	- If it's not labeled or taken into consideration, the process might consider the region outside the region of interest

## Spectral Images
- Dark images in around <470 and >710 (poor SNR)

## TODO
- Normalise
- Adjustment by Reference
