## Project Description

Cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, and resection is a common surgical treatment to remove tumors. The identification of boundaries of brain tumors and their anatomical relationship with surrounding tissues, however, is one of the main challenges in neurosurgery. Current tools to achieve satisfactory resection include fluorescence-guided resection, intra-operative neuromonitoring, ultrasound, etc. Several new intra-operative optical imaging technologies have been recently investigated for this purpose.

Spectral imaging has been a promising optical imaging technique in the operating rooms [1], which could provide more insight than the conventional RGB images. Due to the optical properties of tissues determine the measured reflectance spectrum, spectral imaging has the potential to non-invasively extract biological information, such as tissue type and pathology [1]. Multispectral imaging (MSI) is an advanced intra-operative spectral imaging technology, which contains tens of spectral bandwidths. It captures the reflectance spectrum of all tissues in the entire view to generate image cubes with both spatial and spectral information. To assist with tumorr resection in surgeries using this technology, an accurate semantic segmentation for these spectral image cubes is an important prerequisite.

We have developed an innovative neurosurgical imaging system that has allowed us to acquire datasets in human brain tissue for approximately 30 patients at Charing Cross Hospital. This is a highly novel dataset with many possibilities for analysis approach and is attracting interest from our clinical colleagues. This project will contain image registration, image segmentation and correlation with other patient data, and will require collaboration with our neurosurgical colleagues.
