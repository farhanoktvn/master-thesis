  abstract = {Semantic image segmentation is an important prerequisite for context-awareness and autonomous robotics in surgery. The state of the art has focused on conventional RGB video data acquired during minimally invasive surgery, but full-scene semantic segmentation based on spectral imaging data and obtained during open surgery has received almost no attention to date. To address this gap in the literature, we are investigating the following research questions based on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data of pigs acquired in an open surgery setting: (1) What is an adequate representation of HSI data for neural network-based fully automated organ segmentation, especially with respect to the spatial granularity of the data (pixels vs. superpixels vs. patches vs. full images)? (2) Is there a benefit of using HSI data compared to other modalities, namely RGB data and processed HSI data (e.g. tissue parameters like oxygenation), when performing semantic organ segmentation? According to a comprehensive validation study based on 506 HSI images from 20 pigs, annotated with a total of 19 classes, deep learning-based segmentation performance increases — consistently across modalities — with the spatial context of the input data. Unprocessed HSI data offers an advantage over RGB data or processed data from the camera provider, with the advantage increasing with decreasing size of the input to the neural network. Maximum performance (HSI applied to whole images) yielded a mean DSC of 0.90 ((standard deviation (SD)) 0.04), which is in the range of the inter-rater variability (DSC of 0.89 ((standard deviation (SD)) 0.07)). We conclude that HSI could become a powerful image modality for fully-automatic surgical scene understanding with many advantages over traditional imaging, including the ability to recover additional functional tissue information.

  abstract = {Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer among men and women. Its diagnosis in early stages, typically done through the analysis of colon biopsy images, can greatly improve the chances of a successful treatment. This paper proposes to use convolution neural networks (CNNs) to predict three tissue types related to the progression of CRC: benign hyperplasia (BH), intraepithelial neoplasia (IN), and carcinoma (Ca). Methods: Multispectral biopsy images of thirty CRC patients were retrospectively analyzed. Images of tissue samples were divided into three groups, based on their type (10 BH, 10 IN, and 10 Ca). An active contour model was used to segment image regions containing pathological tissues. Tissue samples were classified using a CNN containing convolution, max-pooling, and fully-connected layers. Available tissue samples were split into a training set, for learning the CNN parameters, and test set, for evaluating its performance. Results: An accuracy of 99.17\% was obtained from segmented image regions, outperforming existing approaches based on traditional feature extraction, and classification techniques. Conclusions: Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CNN for the classification of CRC tissue types, in particular when using presegmented regions of interest.},

However, obtaining such datasets in the medical domain remains a challenge. In this paper, we present methods for generating synthetic medical images using recently presented deep learning Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Furthermore, we show that generated medical images can be used for synthetic data augmentation, and improve the performance of CNN for medical image classification. Our novel method is demonstrated on a limited dataset of computed tomography (CT) images of 182 liver lesions (53 cysts, 64 metastases and 65 hemangiomas). We first exploit GAN architectures for synthesizing high quality liver lesion ROIs. Then we present a novel scheme for liver lesion classification using CNN. Finally, we train the CNN using classic data augmentation and our synthetic data augmentation and compare performance. In addition, we explore the quality of our synthesized examples using visualization and expert assessment. The classification performance using only classic data augmentation yielded 78.6\% sensitivity and 88.4\% specificity. By adding the synthetic data augmentation the results increased to 85.7\% sensitivity and 92.4\% specificity. We believe that this approach to synthetic data augmentation can generalize to other medical classification applications and thus support radiologists’ efforts to improve diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Deep convolutional neural networks have performed remarkably well on many Computer Vision tasks. However, these networks are heavily reliant on big data to avoid overfitting. Overfitting refers to the phenomenon when a network learns a function with very high variance such as to perfectly model the training data. Unfortunately, many application domains do not have access to big data, such as medical image analysis. This survey focuses on Data Augmentation, a data-space solution to the problem of limited data. Data Augmentation encompasses a suite of techniques that enhance the size and quality of training datasets such that better Deep Learning models can be built using them. The image augmentation algorithms discussed in this survey include geometric transformations, color space augmentations, kernel filters, mixing images, random erasing, feature space augmentation, adversarial training, generative adversarial networks, neural style transfer, and meta-learning. The application of augmentation methods based on GANs are heavily covered in this survey. In addition to augmentation techniques, this paper will briefly discuss other characteristics of Data Augmentation such as test-time augmentation, resolution impact, final dataset size, and curriculum learning. This survey will present existing methods for Data Augmentation, promising developments, and meta-level decisions for implementing Data Augmentation. Readers will understand how Data Augmentation can improve the performance of their models and expand limited datasets to take advantage of the capabilities of big data.},

We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks.

Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

The HELICoiD (HypErspectraL Imaging Cancer Detection) project is a European FET project that has the goal to develop a demonstrator capable to discriminate, with high precision, between normal and tumour tissues, operating in real-time, during neurosurgical operations. This demonstrator could help the neurosurgeons in the process of brain tumour resection, avoiding the excessive extraction of normal tissue and unintentionally leaving small remnants of tumour. Such precise delimitation of the tumour boundaries will improve the results of the surgery. The HELICoiD demonstrator is composed of two hyperspectral cameras obtained from Headwall. The first one in the spectral range from 400 to 1000 nm (visible and near infrared) and the second one in the spectral range from 900 to 1700 nm (near infrared). The demonstrator also includes an illumination system that covers the spectral range from 400 nm to 2200 nm. A data processing unit is in charge of managing all the parts of the demonstrator, and a high performance platform aims to accelerate the hyperspectral image classification process. Each one of these elements is installed in a customized structure specially designed for surgical environments. Preliminary results of the classification algorithms offer high accuracy (over 95\%) in the discrimination between normal and tumour tissues.},

  abstract   = {Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs) with contracting and expanding paths have shown prominence for the majority of medical image segmentation applications since the past decade. In FCNNs, the encoder plays an integral role by learning both global and local features and contextual representations which can be utilized for semantic output prediction by the decoder. Despite their success, the locality of convolutional layers in FCNNs, limits the capability of learning long-range spatial dependencies. Inspired by the recent success of transformers for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in long-range sequence learning, we reformulate the task of volumetric (3D) medical image segmentation as a sequence-to-sequence prediction problem. We introduce a novel architecture, dubbed as UNEt TRansformers (UNETR), that utilizes a transformer as the encoder to learn sequence representations of the input volume and effectively capture the global multi-scale information, while also following the successful "U-shaped" network design for the encoder and decoder. The transformer encoder is directly connected to a decoder via skip connections at different resolutions to compute the final semantic segmentation output. We have validated the performance of our method on the Multi Atlas Labeling Beyond The Cranial Vault (BTCV) dataset for multi-organ segmentation and the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset for brain tumor and spleen segmentation tasks.

  abstract   = {Semantic segmentation of brain tumors is a fundamental medical image analysis task involving multiple MRI imaging modalities that can assist clinicians in diagnosing the patient and successively studying the progression of the malignant entity. In recent years, Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs) approaches have become the de facto standard for 3D medical image segmentation. The popular “U-shaped” network architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance benchmarks on different 2D and 3D semantic segmentation tasks and across various imaging modalities. However, due to the limited kernel size of convolution layers in FCNNs, their performance of modeling long-range information is sub-optimal, and this can lead to deficiencies in the segmentation of tumors with variable sizes. On the other hand, transformer models have demonstrated excellent capabilities in capturing such long-range information in multiple domains, including natural language processing and computer vision. Inspired by the success of vision transformers and their variants, we propose a novel segmentation model termed Swin UNEt TRansformers (Swin UNETR). Specifically, the task of 3D brain tumor semantic segmentation is reformulated as a sequence to sequence prediction problem wherein multi-modal input data is projected into a 1D sequence of embedding and used as an input to a hierarchical Swin transformer as the encoder. The swin transformer encoder extracts features at five different resolutions by utilizing shifted windows for computing self-attention and is connected to an FCNN-based decoder at each resolution via skip connections. We have participated in BraTS 2021 segmentation challenge, and our proposed model ranks among the top-performing approaches in the validation phase.},

  abstract   = {Medical image segmentation is an essential prerequisite for developing healthcare systems, especially for disease diagnosis and treatment planning. On various medical image segmentation tasks, the u-shaped architecture, also known as U-Net, has become the de-facto standard and achieved tremendous success. However, due to the intrinsic locality of convolution operations, U-Net generally demonstrates limitations in explicitly modeling long-range dependency. Transformers, designed for sequence-to-sequence prediction, have emerged as alternative architectures with innate global self-attention mechanisms, but can result in limited localization abilities due to insufficient low-level details. In this paper, we propose TransUNet, which merits both Transformers and U-Net, as a strong alternative for medical image segmentation. On one hand, the Transformer encodes tokenized image patches from a convolution neural network (CNN) feature map as the input sequence for extracting global contexts. On the other hand, the decoder upsamples the encoded features which are then combined with the high-resolution CNN feature maps to enable precise localization. We argue that Transformers can serve as strong encoders for medical image segmentation tasks, with the combination of U-Net to enhance finer details by recovering localized spatial information. TransUNet achieves superior performances to various competing methods on different medical applications including multi-organ segmentation and cardiac segmentation.

While only the semantics of each task differ, current research focuses on designing specialized architectures for each task. We present Masked-attention Mask Transformer (Mask2Former), a new architecture capable of addressing any image segmentation task (panoptic, instance or semantic). Its key components include masked attention, which extracts localized features by constraining cross-attention within predicted mask regions. In addition to reducing the research effort by at least three times, it outperforms the best specialized architectures by a significant margin on four popular datasets. Most notably, Mask2Former sets a new state-of-the-art for panoptic segmentation (57.8 PQ on COCO), instance segmentation (50.1 AP on COCO) and semantic segmentation (57.7 mIoU on ADE20K).},

Eleven tissue types were sampled, each sequentially exposed to 6 lighting conditions. Two convolutional neural network machine learning models were developed to classify tissues based on multispectral and white-light color images (ARRInet-M and ARRInet-W, respectively). Blinded otolaryngology residents were asked to identify tissue specimens from white-light color images, and their performance was compared with that of the ARRInet models.ResultsA novel multispectral imaging system was developed with minimal adaptation to an existing digital operating microscope. With 81.8\% accuracy in tissue identification of full-size images, the multispectral ARRInet-M classifier outperformed the white-light-only ARRInet-W model (45.5\%) and surgical residents (69.7\%). Challenges with discrimination occurred with parotid vs fat and blood vessels vs nerve.ConclusionsA deep learning model using multispectral imaging outperformed a similar model and surgical residents using traditional white-light imaging at the task of classifying normal human head and neck tissue ex vivo. These results suggest that multispectral imaging can enhance surgical vision and augment surgeons? ability to identify tissues during a procedure.},

Different intraoperative guidance tools are currently employed during the resection tumor but having several limitations. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is arising as a label-free and non-ionizing technique that could assist neurosurgeons during surgical procedures. In this paper, an analysis between in-vivo and ex-vivo human brain tumor samples using HSI has been performed to evaluate the correlation between both types of samples. Spectral ratios of the oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin were employed to distinguish between normal tissue, tumor tissue and blood vessels. A database composed by seven in-vivo and fourteen ex-vivo hyperspectral images obtained from seven different patients diagnosed with glioblastoma Grade IV, metastatic secondary breast cancer, meningioma Grade I and II, and astrocytoma (glioma) Grade II. 44,964 pixels labeled pixels were employed in this work. The proposed method achieved discrimination between different tissue types using the proposed spectral ratio. Comparison between in-vivo and ex-vivo samples indicated that ex-vivo samples generate higher hemoglobin ratios. Moreover, vascular enhanced maps were generated using the spectral ratio, targeting real-time intraoperative surgical assistance.},

  abstract = {The study of brain science is vital to human health. The application of hyperspectral imaging in biomedical fields has grown dramatically in recent years due to their unique optical imaging method and multidimensional information acquisition. Hyperspectral imaging technology can acquire two-dimensional spatial information and one-dimensional spectral information of biological samples simultaneously, covering the ultraviolet, visible and infrared spectral ranges with high spectral resolution, which can provide diagnostic information about the physiological, morphological and biochemical components of tissues and organs. This technology also presents finer spectral features for brain imaging studies, and further provides more auxiliary information for cerebral disease research. This paper reviews the recent advance of hyperspectral imaging in cerebral diagnosis. Firstly, the experimental setup, image acquisition and pre-processing, and analysis methods of hyperspectral technology were introduced. Secondly, the latest research progress and applications of hyperspectral imaging in brain tissue metabolism, hemodynamics, and brain cancer diagnosis in recent years were summarized briefly. Finally, the limitations of the application of hyperspectral imaging in cerebral disease diagnosis field were analyzed, and the future development direction was proposed.},

  abstract   = {The primary treatment for malignant brain tumors is surgical resection. While gross total resection improves the prognosis, a supratotal resection may result in neurological deficits. On the other hand, accurate intraoperative identification of the tumor boundaries may be very difficult, resulting in subtotal resections. Histological examination of biopsies can be used repeatedly to help achieve gross total resection but this is not practically feasible due to the turn-around time of the tissue analysis. Therefore, intraoperative techniques to recognize tissue types are investigated to expedite the clinical workflow for tumor resection and improve outcome by aiding in the identification and removal of the malignant lesion. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an optical imaging technique with the power of extracting additional information from the imaged tissue. Because HSI images cannot be visually assessed by human observers, we instead exploit artificial intelligence techniques and leverage a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to investigate the potential of HSI in twelve in vivo specimens. The proposed framework consists of a 3D–2D hybrid CNN-based approach to create a joint extraction of spectral and spatial information from hyperspectral images. A comparison study was conducted exploiting a 2D CNN, a 1D DNN and two conventional classification methods (SVM, and the SVM classifier combined with the 3D–2D hybrid CNN) to validate the proposed network. An overall accuracy of 80\% was found when tumor, healthy tissue and blood vessels were classified, clearly outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. These results can serve as a basis for brain tumor classification using HSI, and may open future avenues for image-guided neurosurgical applications.},

  abstract  = {Surgery for gliomas (intrinsic brain tumors), especially when low-grade, is challenging due to the infiltrative nature of the lesion. Currently, no real-time, intra-operative, label-free and wide-field tool is available to assist and guide the surgeon to find the relevant demarcations for these tumors. While marker-based methods exist for the high-grade glioma case, there is no convenient solution available for the low-grade case; thus, marker-free optical techniques represent an attractive option. Although RGB imaging is a standard tool in surgical microscopes, it does not contain sufficient information for tissue differentiation. We leverage the richer information from hyperspectral imaging (HSI), acquired with a snapscan camera in the 468-787 nm range, coupled to a surgical microscope, to build a deep-learning-based diagnostic tool for cancer resection with potential for intra-operative guidance. However, the main limitation of the HSI snapscan camera is the image acquisition time, limiting its widespread deployment in the operation theater. Here, we investigate the effect of HSI channel reduction and pre-selection to scope the design space for the development of cheaper and faster sensors. Neural networks are used to identify the most important spectral channels for tumor tissue differentiation, optimizing the trade-off between the number of channels and precision to enable real-time intra-surgical application. We evaluate the performance of our method on a clinical dataset that was acquired during surgery on five patients. By demonstrating the possibility to efficiently detect low-grade glioma, these results can lead to better cancer resection demarcations, potentially improving treatment effectiveness and patient outcome.},

  abstract   = {Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) unlocks the huge potential to a wide variety of applications relied on high-precision pathology image segmentation, such as computational pathology and precision medicine. Since hyperspectral pathology images benefit from the rich and detailed spectral information even beyond the visible spectrum, the key to achieve high-precision hyperspectral pathology image segmentation is to felicitously model the context along high-dimensional spectral bands. Inspired by the strong context modeling ability of transformers, we hereby, for the first time, formulate the contextual feature learning across spectral bands for hyperspectral pathology image segmentation as a sequence-to-sequence prediction procedure by transformers. To assist spectral context learning procedure, we introduce two important strategies: (1) a sparsity scheme enforces the learned contextual relationship to be sparse, so as to eliminates the distraction from the redundant bands; (2) a spectral normalization, a separate group normalization for each spectral band, mitigates the nuisance caused by heterogeneous underlying distributions of bands. We name our method Spectral Transformer (SpecTr), which enjoys two benefits: (1) it has a strong ability to model long-range dependency among spectral bands, and (2) it jointly explores the spatial-spectral features of HSI. Experiments show that SpecTr outperforms other competing methods in a hyperspectral pathology image segmentation benchmark without the need of pre-training.

Hyperspectral imaging is a fast, noncontact, accurate, and safe modern medical detection technology, which is expected to be a new tool of intraoperative diagnosis. In order to make full use of the spectral and spatial information of hyperspectral images (HSIs) to achieve accurate GBM tumor identification, a method based on the fusion of multiple deep models is proposed for in vivo human brain HSI classification. The proposed method includes the following major steps: 1) spectral phasor analysis and data oversampling; 2) 1-D deep neural network (1D-DNN)-based spectral HSI feature extraction and classification; 3) 2-D convolution neural network (2D-CNN)-based spectral–spatial HSI feature extraction and classification; 4) edge-preserving filtering-based classification result fusion and optimization; and 5) fully convolutional network (FCN)-based background segmentation. To verify the capabilities of the proposed method, experiments are performed on two real human brain hyperspectral datasets, including 36 in vivo HSIs captured from 16 different patients. The proposed method can achieve an overall accuracy of 96.69\% for four-class classification and overall accuracy of 96.34\% for GBM tumor identification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits competitive classification performance and can generate satisfactory thematic maps of the location of the GBM tumor, which can provide the surgeon with guidance on successful and precise tumor resection.},

Working with hyperspectral images in vivo, however, is not straightforward as the high dimensionality of the data makes real-time processing challenging. In this paper, a novel dimensionality reduction scheme and a new processing pipeline are introduced to obtain a detailed tumor classification map for intra-operative margin definition during brain surgery. However, existing approaches to dimensionality reduction based on manifold embedding can be time consuming and may not guarantee a consistent result, thus hindering final tissue classification. The proposed framework aims to overcome these problems through a process divided into two steps: dimensionality reduction based on an extension of the T-distributed stochastic neighbor approach is first performed and then a semantic segmentation technique is applied to the embedded results by using a Semantic Texton Forest for tissue classification. Detailed in vivo validation of the proposed method has been performed to demonstrate the potential clinical value of the system.},

GB detection is a challenging application, showing high heterogeneity in the cellular morphology across different patients. We employed an HSI microscope, with a spectral range from 400 to 1000 nm, to collect 517 HS cubes from 13 GB patients using 20× magnification. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), we were able to automatically detect GB within the pathological slides, achieving average sensitivity and specificity values of 88\% and 77\%, respectively, representing an improvement of 7\% and 8\% respectively, as compared to the results obtained using RGB (red, green, and blue) images.

In this approach, the K-means algorithm emerged in the delimitation of tumor borders, which is of crucial importance. The main drawback is the computational complexity of this algorithm. This paper describes the development of the K-means clustering algorithm on different parallel architectures, in order to provide real-time processing during surgical procedures. This algorithm will generate an unsupervised segmentation map that, combined with a supervised classification map, will offer guidance to the neurosurgeon during the tumor resection task. We present parallel K-means clustering based on OpenMP, CUDA and OpenCL paradigms. These algorithms have been validated through an in-vivo hyperspectral human brain image database. Experimental results show that the CUDA version can achieve a speed-up of {\textasciitilde}    150 ×     with respect to a sequential processing. The remarkable result obtained in this paper makes possible the development of a real-time classification system.},

  abstract  = {Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a non-ionizing and non-contact imaging technique capable of obtaining more information than conventional RGB (red green blue) imaging. In the medical field, HSI has commonly been investigated due to its great potential for diagnostic and surgical guidance purposes. However, the large amount of information provided by HSI normally contains redundant or non-relevant information, and it is extremely important to identify the most relevant wavelengths for a certain application in order to improve the accuracy of the predictions and reduce the execution time of the classification algorithm. Additionally, some wavelengths can contain noise and removing such bands can improve the classification stage. The work presented in this paper aims to identify such relevant spectral ranges in the visual-and-near-infrared (VNIR) region for an accurate detection of brain cancer using in vivo hyperspectral images. A methodology based on optimization algorithms has been proposed for this task, identifying the relevant wavelengths to achieve the best accuracy in the classification results obtained by a supervised classifier (support vector machines), and employing the lowest possible number of spectral bands. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology based on the genetic algorithm optimization slightly improves the accuracy of the tumor identification in {\textasciitilde}5\%, using only 48 bands, with respect to the reference results obtained with 128 bands, offering the possibility of developing customized acquisition sensors that could provide real-time HS imaging. The most relevant spectral ranges found comprise between 440.5–465.96 nm, 498.71–509.62 nm, 556.91–575.1 nm, 593.29–615.12 nm, 636.94–666.05 nm, 698.79–731.53 nm and 884.32–902.51 nm.},

  abstract = {The use of hyperspectral imaging for medical applications is becoming more common in recent years. One of the main obstacles that researchers find when developing hyperspectral algorithms for medical applications is the lack of specific, publicly available, and hyperspectral medical data. The work described in this paper was developed within the framework of the European project HELICoiD (HypErspectraL Imaging Cancer Detection), which had as a main goal the application of hyperspectral imaging to the delineation of brain tumors in real-time during neurosurgical operations. In this paper, the methodology followed to generate the first hyperspectral database of in-vivo human brain tissues is presented. Data was acquired employing a customized hyperspectral acquisition system capable of capturing information in the Visual and Near InfraRed (VNIR) range from 400 to 1000 nm. Repeatability was assessed for the cases where two images of the same scene were captured consecutively. The analysis reveals that the system works more efficiently in the spectral range between 450 and 900 nm. A total of 36 hyperspectral images from 22 different patients were obtained. From these data, more than 300 000 spectral signatures were labeled employing a semi-automatic methodology based on the spectral angle mapper algorithm. Four different classes were defined: normal tissue, tumor tissue, blood vessel, and background elements. All the hyperspectral data has been made available in a public repository.},

  abstract   = {In contrast to conventional optical imaging modalities, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is able to capture much more information from a certain scene, both within and beyond the visual spectral range (from 400 to 700 nm). This imaging modality is based on the principle that each material provides different responses to light reflection, absorption, and scattering across the electromagnetic spectrum. Due to these properties, it is possible to differentiate and identify the different materials/substances presented in a certain scene by their spectral signature. Over the last two decades, HSI has demonstrated potential to become a powerful tool to study and identify several diseases in the medical field, being a non-contact, non-ionizing, and a label-free imaging modality. In this review, the use of HSI as an imaging tool for the analysis and detection of cancer is presented. The basic concepts related to this technology are detailed. The most relevant, state-of-the-art studies that can be found in the literature using HSI for cancer analysis are presented and summarized, both in-vivo and ex-vivo. Lastly, we discuss the current limitations of this technology in the field of cancer detection, together with some insights into possible future steps in the improvement of this technology.},

  abstract  = {Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) allows for the acquisition of large numbers of spectral bands throughout the electromagnetic spectrum (within and beyond the visual range) with respect to the surface of scenes captured by sensors. Using this information and a set of complex classification algorithms, it is possible to determine which material or substance is located in each pixel. The work presented in this paper aims to exploit the characteristics of HSI to develop a demonstrator capable of delineating tumor tissue from brain tissue during neurosurgical operations. Improved delineation of tumor boundaries is expected to improve the results of surgery. The developed demonstrator is composed of two hyperspectral cameras covering a spectral range of 400–1700 nm. Furthermore, a hardware accelerator connected to a control unit is used to speed up the hyperspectral brain cancer detection algorithm to achieve processing during the time of surgery. A labeled dataset comprised of more than 300,000 spectral signatures is used as the training dataset for the supervised stage of the classification algorithm. In this preliminary study, thematic maps obtained from a validation database of seven hyperspectral images of in vivo brain tissue captured and processed during neurosurgical operations demonstrate that the system is able to discriminate between normal and tumor tissue in the brain. The results can be provided during the surgical procedure ({\textasciitilde}1 min), making it a practical system for neurosurgeons to use in the near future to improve excision and potentially improve patient outcomes.},

  abstract   = {Average Hausdorff distance is a widely used performance measure to calculate the distance between two point sets. In medical image segmentation, it is used to compare ground truth images with segmentations allowing their ranking. We identified, however, ranking errors of average Hausdorff distance making it less suitable for applications in segmentation performance assessment. To mitigate this error, we present a modified calculation of this performance measure that we have coined “balanced average Hausdorff distance”. To simulate segmentations for ranking, we manually created non-overlapping segmentation errors common in magnetic resonance angiography cerebral vessel segmentation as our use-case. Adding the created errors consecutively and randomly to the ground truth, we created sets of simulated segmentations with increasing number of errors. Each set of simulated segmentations was ranked using both performance measures. We calculated the Kendall rank correlation coefficient between the segmentation ranking and the number of errors in each simulated segmentation. The rankings produced by balanced average Hausdorff distance had a significantly higher median correlation (1.00) than those by average Hausdorff distance (0.89). In 200 total rankings, the former misranked 52 whilst the latter misranked 179 segmentations. Balanced average Hausdorff distance is more suitable for rankings and quality assessment of segmentations than average Hausdorff distance.},

  abstract   = {Abstract In 1884 a paper by J.P. Finley appeared in the American Meteorological Journal describing the results of an experimental tornado forecasting program in the central and eastern United States. Finley's paper reported “percentages of verifications” exceeding 95\%, where this index of performance was defined as the percentage of correct tornado/no-tornado forecasts. Within six months, three papers had appeared that identified deficiencies in Finley's method of verification and/or proposed alternative measures of forecasting performance in the context of this 2×2 verification problem. During the period from 1885 to 1893, several other authors in the United States and Europe, in most cases stimulated either by Finley's paper or by the three early responses, made noteworthy contributions to methods-oriented and practices-oriented discussions of issues related to forecast verification in general and verification of tornado forecasts in particular. The burst of verification-related activities during the period 1884–1893 is referred to here as the “Finley affair.” It marked the beginning of substantive conceptual and methodological developments and discussions in the important subdiscipline of forecast verification. This paper describes the events that constitute the Finley affair in some detail and attempts to place this affair in proper historical context from the perspective of the mid-1990s. Whatever their individual strengths and weaknesses, the measures introduced during the period from 1884 to 1893 have withstood important tests of time—for example, these measures have been rediscovered on one or more occasions and they are still widely used today (generally under names assigned since 1900). Moreover, many of the issues vis-à-vis forecast verification that were first raised during the Finley affair remain issues of considerable importance more than 100 years later.},

The reader is referred to more comprehensive texts for further details about brain tumour classification and the genetic abnormalities of these tumours.1
                
                Most recent classifications of brain tumours build on the 1926 work of Bailey and Cushing.2 This classification named tumours after the cell type in the developing embryo/fetus or adult which the tumour cells most resembled histologically. The cell of origin of the majority of brain tumours is unknown as no pre-malignant states are recognised, as is the case in some epithelial tumour forms. In some tumours, cells may be so atypical that it is difficult to compare them with any normal cell type—hence the use of terms such as glioblastoma. Many unsound or illogical terms have remained in the classifications, as once established in a complex medical setting they are difficult to change. In this paper the terminology and definitions of the World Health Organization classification of 2000 will be exclusively used.1 There are more than 120 entities in this classification and here we will concentrate on those that most frequently occur in adults and children. These are the pilocytic astrocytomas, ependymomas, and medulloblastomas in children, and the diffuse astrocytic tumours (including astrocytoma, anaplastic astrocytomas, and glioblastomas), oligodendrogliomas, and meningiomas in adults.
                
                Tumours of the central nervous system often have a wide morphological spectrum and classification is dependent on the recognition of areas with the characteristic histology for a particular tumour type. Immunocytochemical methods may be required to demonstrate the expression by the tumour cells of an antigen typically expressed by a particular cell type and thus to assist in classification.

When the objective is to prepare an intervention plan, it is absolutely necessary to understand the matters the restorer is going to encounter. Also, when the aim is a better understanding of the artwork, and perhaps an authenticity check, it is highly relevant to know which materials were employed, since they may differ depending on the period of execution and on the specific artist as well. To identify materials on a painting's surface in a reliable manner, currently the most popular and trustworthy method is the analysis of microsamples of the paint layer. However, chemical analyses although reliable, have a number of drawbacks. The first is linked to the fact that this is an invasive method. The samples used need to be detached from the painting and will not be put back in place. Moreover, the achieved results are in principle - and often also in practice - valid only for that specific specimen and cannot generally be extended to neighboring areas.},

The methods are applied to some wall paintings from the Tomb of the Monkey, an Etruscan tomb in the necropolis of Poggio Renzo, near the city of Chiusi (Siena), Italy, dated around 480-470 BC. It is shown that the techniques described are able to highlight and enhance a number of details that cannot be perceived in either any of the original channel images or any single processed output channel.},

  abstract = {Two critical limitations for using current satellite sensors in real-time crop management are the lack of imagery with optimum spatial and spectral resolutions and an unfavorable revisit time for most crop stress-detection applications. Alternatives based on manned airborne platforms are lacking due to their high operational costs. A fundamental requirement for providing useful remote sensing products in agriculture is the capacity to combine high spatial resolution and quick turnaround times. Remote sensing sensors placed on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could fill this gap, providing low-cost approaches to meet the critical requirements of spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. This paper demonstrates the ability to generate quantitative remote sensing products by means of a helicopter-based UAV equipped with inexpensive thermal and narrowband multispectral imaging sensors. During summer of 2007, the platform was flown over agricultural fields, obtaining thermal imagery in the 7.5-13-mum region (40-cm resolution) and narrowband multispectral imagery in the 400-800-nm spectral region (20-cm resolution). Surface reflectance and temperature imagery were obtained, after atmospheric corrections with MODTRAN. Biophysical parameters were estimated using vegetation indices, namely, normalized difference vegetation index, transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index/optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index, and photochemical reflectance index (PRI), coupled with SAILH and FLIGHT models. As a result, the image products of leaf area index, chlorophyll content (C ab), and water stress detection from PRI index and canopy temperature were produced and successfully validated. This paper demonstrates that results obtained with a low-cost UAV system for agricultural applications yielded comparable estimations, if not better, than those obtained by traditional manned airborne sensors.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Adequate evaluation of breast tumor resection at surgery continues to be an important issue in surgical care, as over 30\% of postoperative tumors recur locally unless radiation is used to destroy remaining tumor cells in the field. Medical Hyperspectral Imaging (MHSI) delivers near-real time images of biomarkers in tissue, providing an assessment of pathophysiology and the potential to distinguish different tissues based on spectral characteristics.Method: We have used an experimental DMBA-induced rat breast tumor model to examine the intraoperative utility of MHSI, in distinguishing tumor from normal breast and other tissues. Rats bearing tumors underwent surgical exposure and MHSI imaging, followed by partial resection of the tumors, then MHSI imaging of the resection bed, and finally total resection of tumors and of grossly normal-appearing glands. Resected tissue underwent gross examination, MHSI imaging, and histopathological evaluation.Results: An algorithm based on spectral characteristics of tissue types was developed to distinguish between tumor and normal tissues. Tissues including tumor, blood vessels, muscle, and connective tissue were clearly identified and differentiated by MHSI. Fragments of residual tumor 0.5 - 1 mm in size intentionally left in the operative bed were readily identified. MHSI demonstrated a sensitivity of 89\% and a specificity of 94\% for detection of residual tumor, comparable to that of histopathological examination of the tumor bed (85\% and 92\%, respectively).Conclusion: We conclude that MHSI may be useful in identifying small residual tumor in a tumor resection bed and for indicating areas requiring more extensive resection and more effective biopsy locations to the surgeon. 3},

Optical techniques can be used to discriminate and quantify the chromophores present in bruised skin, and thereby aid dating of an injury. However, spectroscopic techniques provide only average chromophore concentrations for the sampled volume, and contain little information about the spatial chromophore distribution in the bruise. Hyperspectral imaging combines the power of imaging and spectroscopy, and can provide both spectroscopic and spatial information. In this study a hyperspectral imaging system developed by Norsk Elektro Optikk AS was used to measure the temporal development of bruised skin in a human volunteer. The bruises were inflicted by paintball bullets. The wavelength ranges used were 400 - 1000 nm (VNIR) and 900 - 1700 nm (SWIR), and the spectral sampling intervals were 3.7 and 5 nm, respectively. Preliminary results show good spatial discrimination of the bruised areas compared to normal skin. Development of a white spot can be seen in the central zone of the bruises. This central white zone was found to resemble the shape of the object hitting the skin, and is believed to develop in areas where the impact caused vessel damage. These results show that hyperspectral imaging is a promising technique to evaluate the temporal and spatial development of bruises on human skin.},

In this paper, we propose a new tissue classification method for HE stained liver pathology specimens by using hyperspectral image. At first we select valid spectra from the image to make a clear distinction between fibers and cytoplasm, and then classify five types of tissue based on the bag of features (BoF). The average classification accuracy for all tissues was improved by 11\% in the case of using BoF of RGB and selected spectra bands in comparison with using only RGB. In particular, the improvement reached to 24\% for fibers and 5\% for cytoplasm.},

In this systematic review, we summarize the methods and uses of HSI/MSI for staining and color correction, immunohistochemistry, autofluorescence, and histopathological diagnostic research. Studies include hematology, breast cancer, head and neck cancer, skin cancer, and diseases of central nervous, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary systems. The use of HSI/MSI suggest an improvement in the detection of diseases and clinical practice compared with traditional RGB analysis, and brings new opportunities in histological analysis of samples, such as digital staining or alleviating the inter-laboratory variability of digitized samples.

  abstract   = {Purpose: Neuronavigation based on preoperative imaging data is a ubiquitous tool for image guidance in neurosurgery. However, it is rendered unreliable when brain shift invalidates the patient-to-image registration. Many investigators have tried to explain, quantify, and compensate for this phenomenon to allow extended use of neuronavigation systems for the duration of surgery. The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of the work that has been done investigating brain shift. Methods: A review of the literature dealing with the explanation, quantification and compensation of brain shift is presented. The review is based on a systematic search using relevant keywords and phrases in PubMed. The review is organized based on a developed taxonomy that classifies brain shift as occurring due to physical, surgical or biological factors. Results: This paper gives an overview of the work investigating, quantifying, and compensating for brain shift in neuronavigation while describing the successes, setbacks, and additional needs in the field. An analysis of the literature demonstrates a high variability in the methods used to quantify brain shift as well as a wide range in the measured magnitude of the brain shift, depending on the specifics of the intervention. The analysis indicates the need for additional research to be done in quantifying independent effects of brain shift in order for some of the state of the art compensation methods to become useful. Conclusion: This review allows for a thorough understanding of the work investigating brain shift and introduces the needs for future avenues of investigation of the phenomenon.},

Therefore, noninvasive real-time monitoring of the cerebral oxygen metabolism in cardiac arrest patients is extremely important. Hyperspectral near-infrared spectroscopy (hNIRS) is a noninvasive technique that measures concentrations of the key chromophores in the brain, such as oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxygenated hemoglobin, and cytochrome C oxidase (CCO), an intracellular marker of oxygen consumption. We tested hNIRS on 10 patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve insertion, where rapid ventricular pacing (RVP) is required to temporarily induce sudden hypotension and hypoperfusion that mimic cardiac arrest. Using multidistance hNIRS, we found that tissue oxygen saturation changes in the cerebral tissue were lower than those in the scalp during RVP. CCO redox changes were detected in cerebral tissue but not in the scalp during RVP. We have demonstrated that hNIRS is feasible and can detect sudden changes in cerebral oxygenation and metabolism in patients during profound hypotension.},

The identification of this subspace enables a correct dimensionality reduction, yielding gains in algorithm performance and complexity and in data storage. This paper introduces a new minimum mean square error-based approach to infer the signal subspace in hyperspectral imagery. The method, which is termed hyperspectral signal identification by minimum error, is eigen decomposition based, unsupervised, and fully automatic (i.e., it does not depend on any tuning parameters). It first estimates the signal and noise correlation matrices and then selects the subset of eigenvalues that best represents the signal subspace in the least squared error sense. State-of-the-art performance of the proposed method is illustrated by using simulated and real hyperspectral images.},
