One of the main obstacles that researchers find when developing hyperspectral algorithms for medical applications is the lack of specific, publicly available, and hyperspectral medical data. The work described in this paper was developed within the framework of the European project HELICoiD (HypErspectraL Imaging Cancer Detection), which had as a main goal the application of hyperspectral imaging to the delineation of brain tumors in real-time during neurosurgical operations. In this paper, the methodology followed to generate the first hyperspectral database of in-vivo human brain tissues is presented. Data was acquired employing a customized hyperspectral acquisition system capable of capturing information in the Visual and Near InfraRed (VNIR) range from 400 to 1000 nm. Repeatability was assessed for the cases where two images of the same scene were captured consecutively. The analysis reveals that the system works more efficiently in the spectral range between 450 and 900 nm. A total of 36 hyperspectral images from 22 different patients were obtained. From these data, more than 300 000 spectral signatures were labeled employing a semi-automatic methodology based on the spectral angle mapper algorithm. Four different classes were defined: normal tissue, tumor tissue, blood vessel, and background elements. All the hyperspectral data has been made available in a public repository.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2904788","Seventh Framework Programme(grant numbers:618080); European Commission through the FP7 FET (Future and Emerging Technologies) Open Programme ICT-2011.9.2; Agencia Canaria de Investigación, Innovación y Sociedad de la Información(grant numbers:ProID2017010164); Canary Islands Government through the Canarian Agency for Research, Innovation and the Information Society (ACIISI); Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; “Agencia Canaria de Investigacion, Innovacion y Sociedad de la Información (ACIISI)” of the “Conserjería de Economía, Industria, Comercio y Conocimiento” of the “Gobierno de Canarias”; European Social Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8667294","Hyperspectral imaging;cancer detection;biomedical imaging;medical diagnostic imaging;image databases","Tumors;Hyperspectral imaging;Brain;Surgery;Hospitals;Magnetic resonance imaging","biomedical optical imaging;blood vessels;brain;cancer;hyperspectral imaging;image classification;image segmentation;medical image processing;object detection;tumours","medical applications;hyperspectral algorithms;hyperspectral medical data;brain tumors;hyperspectral database;in-vivo human brain tissues;customized hyperspectral acquisition system;36 hyperspectral images;hyperspectral data;in vivo hyperspectral human brain image database;hyperspectral imaging cancer detection","","58","","60","OAPA","14 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The most important are: excessive extraction of normal (healthy) tissue, and inadvertently leaving small sections of tumor tissue un-resected. This study attempts to help neurosurgeons to accurately determine brain tumor boundaries in the resection process using hyperspectral images. We design real-time classification algorithms to determine the type of tissue located at each pixel using technology that could be made accessible to most hospitals. The pixel classifier function is personalized for each of the 13 in-vivo and in-vitro glioblastoma samples by training in situ working with a region of pixels selected for each label. At a certain point during the resection, the surgeon selects a small area of tumor and healthy tissue from the RGB image and our mathematical model provides the classification map for the full image. We also suggest a personalized separator function for each label in order to find cell families with the hyperspectral signature. Mean intra-patient sensitivity was 89% and 85% for in-vivo and in-vitro samples respectively; however, mean specificity was 96% and 92% respectively. Our model allows the spatial detection of different tumor (or healthy) clones that could be related to phenotype heterogeneity within the brain. We find different vasculature and tumor families within patients which might be related to tumor invasion of the vasculature, and different degrees of tumor malignancy, respectively.","2640-5563","978-1-7281-9132-4","10.1109/DCIS51330.2020.9268641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9268641","hyperspectral imaging;brain tumor;glioblas-toma;pixel classification;tumor heterogeneity;cell signature","Tumors;Surgery;Hyperspectral imaging;Particle separators;Training;In vitro;In vivo","biomedical MRI;brain;cancer;cellular biophysics;image classification;medical image processing;surgery;tumours","hyperspectral images;brain tumor pixels;malignant phenotypes;neurosurgeons;brain tumor resection;excessive extraction;tumor tissue un-resected;brain tumor boundaries;resection process;real-time classification algorithms;pixel classifier function;in-vitro glioblastoma samples;RGB image;classification map;personalized separator function;hyperspectral signature;in-vitro samples;spatial detection;phenotype heterogeneity;tumor families;tumor invasion;tumor malignancy","","","","14","IEEE","30 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Working with hyperspectral images in vivo, however, is not straightforward as the high dimensionality of the data makes real-time processing challenging. In this paper, a novel dimensionality reduction scheme and a new processing pipeline are introduced to obtain a detailed tumor classification map for intra-operative margin definition during brain surgery. However, existing approaches to dimensionality reduction based on manifold embedding can be time consuming and may not guarantee a consistent result, thus hindering final tissue classification. The proposed framework aims to overcome these problems through a process divided into two steps: dimensionality reduction based on an extension of the T-distributed stochastic neighbor approach is first performed and then a semantic segmentation technique is applied to the embedded results by using a Semantic Texton Forest for tissue classification. Detailed in vivo validation of the proposed method has been performed to demonstrate the potential clinical value of the system.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2017.2695523","European Commission through the FP7 FET Open Programme(grant numbers:ICT-2011.9.2); European Project HELICoiD HypErspectral Imaging Cancer Detection(grant numbers:618080); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7907323","Manifold embedding;hyperspectral imaging;semantic segmentation;brain cancer detection","Hyperspectral imaging;Tumors;Image segmentation;Semantics;Brain;Cancer;Manifolds","biological tissues;brain;cancer;hyperspectral imaging;image classification;image segmentation;medical image processing;semantic networks;stochastic processes","hyperspectral brain imaging;dimensionality reduction scheme;tumor classification map;brain surgery;tissue classification;T-distributed stochastic neighbor approach;semantic segmentation technique;semantic texton forest","Algorithms;Brain;Humans;Neuroimaging;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Semantics","41","","87","CCBY","24 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The surgeons' naked eye sometimes is not enough to accurately delineate the brain tumor location and extension due to its diffuse nature that infiltrates in the surrounding healthy tissue. For this reason, a support system that provides accurate cancer delimitation is essential in order to improve the surgery outcomes and hence the patient's quality of life. The brain cancer detection system developed as part of the “HypErspectraL Imaging Cancer Detection” (HELICoiD) European project meets this requirement exploiting a non-invasive technique suitable for medical diagnosis: the hyperspectral imaging (HSI). A crucial constraint that this system has to satisfy is providing a real-time response in order to not prolong the surgery. The large amount of data that characterizes the hyperspectral images, and the complex elaborations performed by the classification system make the High Performance Computing (HPC) systems essential to provide real-time processing. The most efficient implementation developed in this work, which exploits the Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) technology, is able to classify the biggest image of the database (worst case) in less than three seconds, largely satisfying the real-time constraint set to 1 minute for surgical procedures, becoming a potential solution to implement hyperspectral video processing in the near future.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2963939","Agencia Canaria de Investigación, Innovación y Sociedad de la Información(grant numbers:ProID2017010164); Spanish Government through PLATINO Project(grant numbers:TEC2017-86722-C4-4-R); European Commission(grant numbers:ICT-2011.9.2); European Commission(grant numbers:618080); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8949497","Hyperspectral imaging;high performance computing;graphic processing unit;parallel processing;parallel architectures;image processing;biomedical engineering;medical diagnostic imaging;cancer detection;supervised classification;support vector machines;K-Nearest neighbors;principal component analysis;K-means;majority voting","Surgery;Real-time systems;Cancer detection;Tumors;Graphics processing units;Hyperspectral imaging;Cancer","biomedical optical imaging;brain;cancer;graphics processing units;image classification;medical image processing;surgery;tumours","real-time computing;intraoperative hyperspectral Imaging;multiGPU platforms;surgical procedure;brain tumor location;brain cancer detection system;HypErspectraL Imaging Cancer Detection European project;noninvasive technique suitable;real-time response;hyperspectral images;classification system;high performance computing systems;graphic processing unit technology;hyperspectral video processing;cancer delimitation","","15","","42","CCBY","3 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A HSI dataset of in-vivo brain tissue was acquired by two HS cameras, covering the VNIR (Visual and Near-Infrared) [400–1000 nm] and NIR (Near-Infrared) [900–1700 nm] spectral ranges. Both HS images were registered using feature-based techniques with different geometric transformations to perform a spectral analysis of a certain pixel. Reflectance and absorbance spectral signatures were analyzed identifying spectral absorbance peaks related with hemoglobin and water. Finally, a statistical analysis was performed, where normal tissue (NT), tumor tissue (TT), and hypervascularized tissue (HT) were compared, obtaining highly statistically significance between HT-NT and HT-TT in both VNIR and NIR spectral ranges analyzed, and some no statistically significant differences between TT and NT in certain spectral ranges.","2640-5563","978-1-6654-2116-4","10.1109/DCIS53048.2021.9666168","European Commission(grant numbers:H2020-EU.3.1.4.2); Spanish Government and European Union (FEDER funds)(grant numbers:PID2020-116417RB-C42); Agencia Canaria de Investigacion, Innovacion y Sociedad de la Información (ACIISI); European Social Fund (FSE); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9666168","Hyperspectral imaging;Brain tumors;Image registration;Statistical Analysis","Reflectivity;Brain;Visualization;Statistical analysis;Surgery;Detectors;Spatial resolution","biomedical optical imaging;brain;image classification;image segmentation;medical image processing;neurophysiology;surgery;tumours","preliminary spectral analysis;HSI dataset;in-vivo brain tissue;HS cameras;HS images;feature-based techniques;geometric transformations;absorbance spectral signatures;spectral absorbance peaks;statistical analysis;NIR spectral ranges;hyperspectral VNIR;NIR sensors;human normal brain;hyperspectral imaging;imaging technique;brain tumor tissue","","1","","30","IEEE","10 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Publicly available HSI databases are yet scarce or lack relevant metadata, anatomical accuracy, and patients' characteristics which limits the clinical utility of the data. The essential problem is that clinical standards for HSI acquisition and archival do not exist. We collected a total of 52 microsurgical HSI images from 10 patients using our customized HSI system for the operation microscopes. We annotated the relevant microanatomical structures and labeled the tissue areas intended for HSI analyses. Using the collected HSI data, we developed the initial design of the microneurosurgical HSI database. The HSI database allows to display and query anatomical annotations, localizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, operation videos, tissue labels, and HSI spectra per individual patient. Here we present the fundamental structures and functions of the HSI database in development.

In the present study, local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from three tracks during microelectrode recording-based (MER) targeting of STN, in five patients. The raw LFP data were preprocessed in original recording setup and then data quality was compared to data with common average derivation. The depth-frequency maps were generated according to preprocessing results for each patient and spectral characteristics of LFPs were explored at each depth across different tracks and different subjects. Spatio-spectral analysis of LFP was investigated to see whether LFP activity can be used for optimal track selection and STN border identification. Analysis show that monopolar derivation suffer from various artifacts and/or power line noise which makes the interpretation of target localization very difficult in most of the subjects. Unlikely, bipolar derivation helps to recover the neurological signals and investigation of signal characteristics. The frequency-vs-depth maps using a modified Welch periodogram with robust statistics, demonstrated that a median-based spectrum estimation approach eliminates outliers pretty well by preserving band-specific LFP activity. The results indicate that there is a clear oscillatory beta activity around 20 Hz in all subjects. 1/f normalization reveals the high frequency oscillations (HFOs) between 200-to-350 Hz in two subjects. It's noted that the optimal track selection is not consistent with the track having highest beta band oscillations in two out of five subjects. In conclusion, microelectrode-derived LFP recordings may provide an alternative approach to single unit activity (SUA)-based MER, for localizing the target STN borders during DBS surgery. Despite the small number of subjects, the present study adds to existing knowledge about LFP-based pathophysiology of PD and its target-based spectral activities.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-9271-8","10.1109/EMBC.2015.7319652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7319652","","Microelectrodes;Satellite broadcasting;Surgery;Oscillators;Target tracking;Data visualization","bioelectric potentials;biomedical electrodes;brain;diseases;medical signal processing;microelectrodes;neurophysiology;spectral analysis","spatio-spectral characterization;local field potentials;subthalamic nucleus;multitrack microelectrode recordings;data quality;depth-frequency maps;optimal track selection;monopolar derivation;power line noise;target localization;bipolar derivation;neurological signals;signal characteristics;modified Welch periodogram;robust statistics;median-based spectrum estimation approach;oscillatory beta activity;1/f normalization;high frequency oscillations;deep brain stimulation surgery;motor symptoms;Parkinson's disease","Deep Brain Stimulation;Humans;Microelectrodes;Parkinson Disease;Subthalamic Nucleus;Treatment Outcome","7","","10","IEEE","5 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These images provide a lot of information about the characteristics of the materials due to the high spectral resolution. This work is focused in the use of this kind of information to detect tumour tissue, particularly brain cancer tissue. In recent years, the study of this kind of tumour has been a challenging task due to the nature of these tissues. The neurosurgeon usually finds several problems to detect tumour tissues by the naked eye. In order to address this problem, this work makes use of high spectral resolution samples in the range from 400 nm to 6000 nm, provided by an Agilent Resolutions Pro V.5 spectrometer that has been diagnosed by histopathology. This instrument can sample a single pixel with a very high spectral resolution. The high spectral resolution allows a reliable separation between the different tissues in brain tumour. The proposed approach is based on a hierarchical decision tree. This approach is composed by several systems of Support Vector Machine classifiers. The 225 used samples come from 25 adults (males and females) and have been taken at different surgical procedures at the University Hospital of Southampton. The main goal is to discriminate between tumour tissue and normal tissue. Specifically, it assigns priority to the group of classes known a priori to the classification showed accordingly to the level of detail. The experimental results indicate that the use of the proposed new decision tree approach could be a solution to effectively discriminate between tumour and normal tissue and additionally provide information about the specific tissue for these classes. For our data set, a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 99.27% have been obtained when healthy and tumour samples are discriminated. These results clearly indicate that the use of high dimensionality spectral data is a promising and effective technique to indicate if a brain sample is or not affected by cancer with a high reliability.","","978-1-4673-7228-2","10.1109/DCIS.2015.7388596","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7388596","Support Vector Machine;Hyperspectral Imaging;Brain Cancer Detection","","biomedical optical imaging;brain;cancer;decision trees;hyperspectral imaging;image classification;image resolution;medical image processing;neurophysiology;support vector machines;surgery;tumours","decision tree classification system;brain cancer detection;spectrographic samples;hyperspectral imaging;remote sensing applications;tumour tissue detection;brain cancer tissue;neurosurgeon;high-spectral resolution samples;Agilent Resolutions Pro V.5 spectrometer;histopathology diagnosis;support vector machine classifiers;surgical procedures;high dimensionality spectral data;wavelength 400 nm to 6000 nm","","2","","21","IEEE","21 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here, the exponent h is determined by the absorption coefficients of whole blood at the excitation and emission wavelengths. The theoretical basis of this spectral processing was verified using simulations and was experimentally validated. Furthermore, the optical spectra of brain tissues collected in vivo was processed using this algorithm to evaluate its impact on brain tissue differentiation using combined fluorescence and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.

This study aims to apply the NIR-IIa/IIb imaging to glioma resection and evaluate their performance by using the developed imaging instrument and intraoperative image fusion method. Methods: A multispectral fluorescence imaging instrument that integrated NIR-I/II/IIa/IIb fluorescence imaging and an intraoperative image fusion method have been developed. Seven patients with grade III/IV glioma have been enrolled. NIR-I/II images of the tumor and NIR-I/II/IIa/IIb images of cerebral vessels were acquired with the administration of indocyanine green. Images were fused using the specialized fusion method to synchronously provide the distribution of the vessels and the surgical boundaries. Results: The NIR-IIa/IIb imaging was successfully applied to the clinic. High imaging resolution and contrast have been attained in the NIR-IIa/IIb spectra. Besides, capillaries with an apparent diameter as small as 182 μm were acquired using NIR-IIb imaging. Tumor-feeding arteries were precisely blocked and tumors were excised to the maximum extent for all patients.

From March 2000 till March 2010, 839 neurosurgical procedures directed on resection of such neoplasms were performed in the intelligent operating theater of Tokyo Women's Medical University with the use of intraoperative MRI, real-time updated neuronavigation system, and Hi-vision operative microscope. To facilitate maximal possible tumor resection with minimal risk of neurological morbidity a special device, called Intraoperative Examination Monitor for Awake Surgery (IEMAS) was developed by us. It provides an opportunity to visualize a wide spectrum of inraoperative information related to condition of the patient, nuances of the surgical procedure, and details of the cortical mapping. The wide set of both anatomical and functional parameters, such as view of the patient's mimic and face movements during answering on the specific questions, type of examination test, position of the surgical instruments, parameters of the bispectral index monitor, and general view of the surgical field through the operating microscope and/or endoscope, is presented compactly in one screen with several displays, which allows fast integrated real-time analysis of the multiple data, nearly without interruption of the surgical manipulations. All members of the surgical team can share this information using several in-room liquid crystal displays. However, the initially designed IEMAS system was occasionally affected by interruption or detachment of the connecting cables, which could interfere with effective advancement of the surgical procedure. To avoid this problem a modified device was created. Its specific feature is wireless information transmitting function attained by incorporation of transmitters with a frequency range of 2.4 GHz. The clinical testing of this system was initiated on February 1, 2010, but quickly revealed crossed line effect between transmitters and receivers. To overcome this obstacle and to isolate transmitters, one channel was changed from wireless connection into wired, which resulted in significant improvement of the clearness of both transmitted images and sounds, and provides an opportunity for effective clinical use of the device. In perspective we wish to make IEMAS system fully wireless, using several types of frequency range transmitters.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-4123-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627616","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5627616","","Surgery;Monitoring;Transmitters;Biomedical monitoring;Cameras;Wireless communication;Receivers","brain;cancer;computer displays;liquid crystal displays;neurophysiology;surgery;telemedicine;tumours","intraoperative examination monitor;awake surgery system;brain tumor resection;awake craniotomy;gliomas;intraoperative MRI;Hi-vision operative microscope;real-time updated neuronavigation system;bispectral index monitor;transmitters;liquid crystal displays;integrated real-time data analysis;receivers;neoplasms;frequency 2.4 GHz","Brain Neoplasms;Craniotomy;Craniotomy;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Intraoperative Care;Monitoring, Intraoperative;Monitoring, Intraoperative;Wakefulness","8","1","5","IEEE","11 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In particular, catechin, a natural phenol contained in cocoa and green tea, appears to play a crucial role in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases reducing the systemic arterial blood pressure. The aim of the present study was to in vivo investigate the effects of oral administration of catechin on pial arteriolar rhythmic diameter changes in SHR in comparison with normotensive rats. Catechin was orally administered to SHR for 2 months at the dosage of 30 mg/kg b.w. The pial microcirculation was visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The vessel diameter and rhythmic variations in diameter were evaluated with computer-assisted method. Moreover, the pial arterioles were classified by Strahler scheme in five orders. On 30 min of recordings was performed the Spectral analysis in order to evaluate different frequency components: the first two in the ranges 0.005-0.0095 Hz and 0.0095-0.021 Hz (endothelial activity), the second in the range 0.021-0.052 Hz (neurogenic activity), the third in the range 0.052-0.145 Hz (myogenic activity), finally, the fourth and the fifth in the ranges 0.145-0.6 Hz (respiratory activity) and 0.6-3.0 Hz (heart beat), respectively. The data indicate that SHR treated with catechin presented an increase in the amplitude frequency components related to endothelial activity that in untreated SHR were markedly reduced. In conclusion, the catechin treatment induces the recovery of endothelial activity in SHR where this frequency component was seriously compromised compared to normotensive rats.","","978-1-7281-5751-1","10.1109/ESGCO49734.2020.9158049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9158049","","Rats;Hypertension;Surgery;Blood pressure;Arterial blood pressure;Fluorescence;Spectral analysis","blood vessels;brain;cardiovascular system;diseases;fluorescence;haemodynamics;medical signal processing;optical microscopy;patient treatment;pneumodynamics;spectral analysis","spectral analysis;fluorescence microscopy;amplitude frequency components;heart beat;respiratory activity;myogenic activity;neurogenic activity;Strahler scheme;computer-assisted method;rhythmic variations;vessel diameter;pial arteriolar rhythmic diameter;cardiovascular diseases;green tea;cocoa;natural phenol;endothelial function;pial arterioles;pial microcirculation;systemic arterial blood pressure;flavanoid-containing foods;spontaneously hypertensive rats;cerebral arteriole vasomotion;normotensive rats;catechin treatment;endothelial activity;frequency 0.005 Hz to 0.0095 Hz;frequency 0.0095 Hz to 0.021 Hz;time 2.0 month;frequency 0.021 Hz to 0.052 Hz;time 30.0 min;frequency 0.052 Hz to 0.145 Hz;frequency 0.145 Hz to 0.6 Hz;frequency 0.6 Hz to 3.0 Hz","","","","8","IEEE","4 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The aim of our study was to investigate the effects of GES on autonomic function, gastric distention and tone, and central control mechanism in gastroparetics patients. 10 gastroparetic patients refractory to standard medical therapy participated in this study and data were collected at baseline session, within two weeks before surgery for implantation of GES system, and at follow-up sessions between 6 to 12 weeks after GES therapy. In each session, electrocardiogram and gastric barostat measurements were conducted before and after a caloric liquid meal. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) brain scans were performed on a separate day. Analysis of autonomic function was accomplished through power spectral analysis of heart rate variability which revealed that the sympthovagal balance was significantly decreased after GES therapy, indicating a significant increase in vagal activity. Results from gastric barostat measurements demonstrated that during GES there was a significant increase in the discomfort threshold for both pressure and volume. Quantitative analysis of PET imaged cerebral activity showed that chronic GES increased thalamic activity. This study suggests that the symptomatic efficacy achieved by GES may be partly attributed to enhanced vagal autonomic function, decreasing gastric sensitivity to volume distention which simulates a postprandial adaptation and the activation of central control mechanisms for nausea and vomiting through thalamic pathways during GES","1557-170X","1-4244-0032-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2006.260115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4463025","","Electrical stimulation;Stomach;Medical treatment;Positron emission tomography;Centralized control;Frequency;Medical control systems;Control systems;Biomedical imaging;Surgery","bioelectric phenomena;biomedical measurement;brain;electrocardiography;neurophysiology;positron emission tomography;prosthetics;spectral analysis","high-frequency electrical stimulation;stomach;gastroparetic patient;low energy gastric electrical stimulation;nausea;vomiting;gastric emptying;autonomic function analysis;gastric distention;gastric tone;central control mechanism;surgery;electrocardiogram;gastric barostat measurement;caloric liquid meal;positron emission tomography brain scans;power spectral analysis;heart rate variability;sympthovagal balance;vagal activity;discomfort threshold;quantitative analysis;PET imaged cerebral activity;chronic gastric electrical stimulation;thalamic activity;symptomatic efficacy;enhanced vagal autonomic function;gastric sensitivity;postprandial adaptation;6 to 12 weeks","Adult;Biomedical Engineering;Electric Stimulation;Electrocardiography;Equipment Design;Female;Gastric Emptying;Gastrointestinal Motility;Gastroparesis;Heart Rate;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Positron-Emission Tomography;Stomach","16","","9","IEEE","15 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is known that DBS modulates neural activity which changes metabolic demands and thus the cerebral circulation state. However, it is unclear whether there are correlations between electrophysiological, hemodynamic and behavioral changes and whether they have any implications for clinical benefits. In order to investigate these questions, we present a miniaturized system for spectroscopic imaging of brain hemodynamics. The system consists of a 144 ×144, pixel pitch, high-sensitivity, analog-output CMOS imager fabricated in a standard 0.35 μm CMOS process, along with a miniaturized imaging system comprising illumination, focusing, analog-to-digital conversion and μSD card based data storage. This enables stand alone operation without a computer, nor electrical or fiberoptic tethers. To achieve high sensitivity, the pixel uses a capacitive transimpedance amplifier (CTIA). The nMOS transistors are in the pixel while pMOS transistors are column-parallel, resulting in a fill factor (FF) of 26%. Running at 60 fps and exposed to 470 nm light, the CMOS imager has a minimum detectable intensity of 2.3 nW/cm2, a maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 49 dB at 2.45 μW/cm2 leading to a dynamic range (DR) of 61 dB while consuming 167 μA from a 3.3 V supply.

Aside from factors such as instrumentation, treatment plans, and surgical protocols, the success of the procedure depends heavily on the accurate placement of the electrode within the optimal therapeutic targets while avoiding vital structures that can cause surgical complications and adverse neurologic effects. Although specific surgical techniques for DBS can vary, interventional guidance with medical imaging has greatly contributed to the development, outcomes, and safety of the procedure. With rapid development in novel imaging techniques, computational methods, and surgical navigation software, as well as growing insights into the disease and mechanism of action of DBS, modern image guidance is expected to further enhance the capacity and efficacy of the procedure in treating PD.

It makes up for about 80% of brain malignancies altogether, with the highest deaths recorded. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the typical imaging type to capture the structure and the physiology of the brain, including in diagnosing the gliomas. Other than that, these images are used in managing the treatment and for surgical purposes. For these procedures, the accurate boundary of the glioma needs to be determined through segmentation. This task is normally performed by the expert. To reduce bias, inter-expert variability and the time spent, automated software-based segmentation tool is applied. This paper presents the segmentation method of the gliomas in MRI images using a using a deep learning-based model architecture segmentation method, which is U-Net. The performance of U-Net is tested on BRATS datasets that consists of patients' data together with the ground truth data. Experimental results on the BraTS2018, BraTS2019 and BraTS2020 validation dataset demonstrates that the proposed model achieved average Dice Scores of 0.97, 0.97, 0.96 for whole tumor, 0.97, 0.98, 0.95 for tumor core and 0.95, 0.94, 0.95 for enhancing tumor respectively.

Generally MRI images contain a significant amount of noise caused by operator performance, equipment and the environment, which leads to serious inaccuracies MRI seems to be efficient in providing information regarding the location of tumors and even the volume. The noise present in the MRI image can be removed by using various de-noising techniques whichever is best suited depending upon the image acquired and then can be processed by any of the segmentation methods. The noise in MRI images may be due to field strength, RF pulses, RF coil, voxel volume, or receiver bandwidth.

Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to receive FGS or traditional white light image-guided surgery (WLS). The detection rate of NIR-II fluorescence was observed. Complete resection rate, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and neurological status were compared. Tissue samples were obtained from the FGS group, with the diagnosis based on the surgeons and the fluorescence recorded for comparison of diagnostic capability. Patients with WHO grade III gliomas or glioblastomas (GBM) were analyzed separately. Results: 15 GBM and 4 WHO grade III glioma patients in the FGS group and 18 GBM and 4 WHO grade III glioma patients in the WLS group were enrolled. The detection rate of NIR-II fluorescence was 100% for GBM. The complete resection rate was significantly increased by the FGS for GBM (FGS, 100% [95% CI 73.41-100] vs. WLS, 50% [95% CI 29.03-70.97], P = 0.0036). The PFS and OS of the FGS group were also significantly prolonged (Median PFS: FGS, 9.0 months vs. WLS, 7.0 months, P < 0.0001; Median OS: FGS, 19.0 months vs. WLS, 15.5 months, P = 0.0002). No recurrence was observed in WHO grade III glioma patients. Conclusions: NIR-II FGS achieves a much better complete resection rate of GBM than conventional WLS, leading to greatly improved survival of GBM patients.

Preoperatively acquired 3D images are used for planning the procedure, and are also employed in intraoperative navigations to help localize and resect brain lesions. However, as the operation progresses, multiple factors contribute to changes that limit the accuracy of the navigation based on pre-operative images alone. Our method to correct for brain shift involves the use of ultrasound intraoperatively to update patient specific pre-operative MRI scans using a physics based dynamic model. To validate the imaging and modeling process, a phantom was designed that simulates the brain and its shifting patterns resulting from several of the clinical factors present during a brain operation. MRI and ultrasound datasets were acquired for several permutations of phantom parameters. Deformation algorithms were then applied to the phantom data to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach as a method to effectively update the pre-operatively acquired MRI data during an operation.","","0-7695-1423-5","10.1109/BIBE.2001.974437","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974437","","Ultrasonic imaging;Brain modeling;Navigation;Imaging phantoms;Magnetic resonance imaging;Deformable models;Mathematical model;Lesions;Neurosurgery;Surgery","brain;surgery;stereo image processing;biomedical ultrasonics;biomedical MRI;medical image processing","ultrasound image based correction;intraoperative brain shift;stereotactic navigational systems;neurosurgical procedures;preoperatively acquired 3D images;brain lesion resection;brain lesion localization;patient specific pre-operative MRI scan updating;physics based dynamic model;modeling;phantom;brain simulation;clinical factors;deformation algorithms","","2","","24","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the susceptible accuracy of placement of the DBS electrode inside the brain nucleus determines the therapeutic efficacy of the method. Unlike normal cases, untreated Parkinsonian states in basal ganglia structures produce oscillations at various frequencies, the most prominent of which is a synchronization in the beta frequency band recorded in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). The actual frequency range and the strength of the beta peak vary among patients. We propose that an on-line spectral analysis of the population activity, as evidenced by microelectrode recordings (MERs) could form a neurophysiological biomarker for confirmation of the on-target placement of the electrode within the STN.","","978-1-4244-2844-1","10.1109/BIBE.2008.4696820","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4696820","Deep Brain Stimulation;Spectral Analysis;Parkinson disease","Frequency;Microelectrodes;Satellite broadcasting;Medical treatment;Electrodes;Brain stimulation;Surgery;Parkinson's disease;Fluctuations;Basal ganglia","bioelectric phenomena;biomedical electrodes;brain;diseases;neurophysiology;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;patient treatment","intraoperative localization;beta band frequency;microelectrode recordings;deep brain stimulation;surgical treatment;Parkinson disease;levodopa therapy;motor fluctuation;dyskinesias;DBS electrode;brain nucleus;therapeutic efficacy;basal ganglia structures;beta frequency band synchronization;subthalamic nucleus;spectral analysis;neurophysiological biomarker","","4","","44","IEEE","8 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) at various depths along the trajectory to Vim in three ET patients. LFP recordings at various depths were processed by a PCA based de-noising method to remove ECG artifacts. The spectral characteristics of LFPs were investigated via frequency-vs-depth maps using a modified Welch periodogram using robust statistics, and further analyzed within different sub-bands to determine whether LFP activity encodes characteristic patterns for the identification of disease-specific subcortical areas. Our results demonstrated that a median-based spectrum estimation approach eliminates outliers better than the traditional averaging technique by preserving band-specific LFP activity. Results indicate that there was clear oscillatory beta activity around 20 Hz in two subjects. One patient displayed relatively high gamma (40 Hz) activity in the sub-thalamic region.

However, an improvement in a robot's mechanical performance does not necessarily represent the embodiment that the user feels. In this paper, we evaluate intuitive operability based on the user's brain activation. Previously, we used functional near-infrared spectroscopic-topography (fNIRS) brain imaging; however, it is better to use a brain measurement technique possessing a high time resolution, as brain activity is has a higher time resolution than fNIRS. The objective was to measure changes in brain activity as a function of a change in the slave arm positioning. In the experiment, the brain activity of four participants was measured using fNIRS while they used a hand controller to move the virtual arm of a surgical simulator. The experiment was carried out with the virtual arm in two positions: one easy to control and the other difficult. The spectrum of the brain activity increased at the easy position more than at the difficult position. We conclude that the brain activity changed as the user perceived that the virtual arm belonged to their body.","","978-1-8893-3551-3","10.1109/WAC.2016.7582953","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7582953","EEG;fNIRS;Robotic Surgery;tele-operation","Brain;Surgery;Electroencephalography;Medical robotics;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements","electroencephalography;human-robot interaction;infrared spectroscopy;manipulators;medical robotics;position control;surgery","brain wave measurement;virtual arm touching task;intuitive robotic surgery;intuitive surgical robot;brain activity measurement;intuitive operability;slave arm positioning;fNIRS;functional near-infrared spectroscopic-topography;surgical simulator virtual arm;EEG","","2","","29","","6 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

High gamma activity (HGA) ranging between 80 and 120 Hz on electrocorticogram (ECoG) is assumed to reflect localized cortical processing. In this report, we used realtime HGA mapping and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for rapid and reliable identification of motor and language functions. Three patients with intra-axial tumors in their dominant hemisphere underwent preoperative fMRI and lesion resection with an awake craniotomy. All patients showed significant fMRI activation evoked by motor and language tasks. After the craniotomy, we recorded ECoG activity by placing subdural grids directly on the exposed brain surface. Each patient performed motor and language tasks and demonstrated realtime HGA dynamics in hand motor areas and parts of the inferior frontal gyrus. Sensitivity and specificity of HGA mapping were 100% compared to ECS mapping in the frontal lobe, which suggested HGA mapping precisely indicated eloquent cortices. The investigation times of HGA mapping was significantly shorter than that of ECS mapping. Specificities of the motor and language-fMRI, however, did not reach 85%. The results of HGA mapping was mostly consistent with those of ECS mapping, although fMRI tended to overestimate functional areas. This novel technique enables rapid and accurate functional mapping.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-7929-0","10.1109/EMBC.2014.6945190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945190","","Electrodes;Magnetic resonance imaging;Lesions;Visualization;Neurosurgery;Sensitivity and specificity","biomedical MRI;brain;electroencephalography;medical image processing;neurophysiology;real-time systems;surgery;tumours","eloquent cortices;HGA mapping;motor language-fMRI;ECS mapping;inferior frontal gyrus;hand motor areas;realtime HGA dynamics;brain surface;subdural grids;recorded ECoG activity;motor tasks;fMRI activation;lesion resection;intra-axial tumors;motor identification;language functions;functional magnetic resonance imaging;realtime HGA mapping;localized cortical processing;electrocorticogram;high-gamma activity;electrocortical stimulation;eloquent cortices;awake craniotomy;neurosurgery;realtime visualization;low-invasive functional brain mapping;frequency 80 Hz to 120 Hz","Brain;Brain Mapping;Computer Systems;Craniotomy;Electrodes, Implanted;Electroencephalography;Gamma Rhythm;Hand Strength;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Task Performance and Analysis;Wakefulness","5","","9","IEEE","6 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is trained to reconstruct missing healthy brain regions. Then, upon application, anomalous regions are determined by identifying areas of highest reconstruction loss. Finally, superpixel segmentation is performed to segment those regions.

However, as brain tumors are large and irregular structures, conventional single-element FUS methods are inefficient because they do not allow large covering. In this study, we numerically showed how 3D-printed acoustic holograms allow to correct the skull aberrations and to produce a large and localized focusing along a pediatric brain tumor. Several targeting configurations were numerically studied aiming to increase the covered tumor volume while reducing the off-target coverage. Fluid-like tissue simulations were performed using the k-space method. We used a 250-kHz single-element device in different configurations (ROC=110 mm, OD=110 or 132 mm, ID=0 or 44 mm), where the optimal setup with lens (OD=132 mm, ID=0 mm) provided a 16 % of tumor coverage compared to the 5 % obtained using the transducer without lens (OD=110 mm, ID=44 mm), while keeping a reduced 0.06 % of off-target coverage. The focal amplitude decreases 1.6 times accordingly to the focus spread. The estimated sonication duration and the number of microbubble injections can be reduced by 3.2 times, defining a time- and cost-efficient approach. The reported approach is simple, low-cost, and feasible to offering personalized, tumor-directed precision FUS treatment, to improve drug delivery for pediatric patients with brain tumors.","1948-5727","978-1-6654-0355-9","10.1109/IUS52206.2021.9593797","Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities(grant numbers:IJC2018-037897-I,PID2019111436RB-C22); Agència Valenciana de la Innovació(grant numbers:INNVAL10/19/016,INNCON/2021/8); Generalitat Valenciana(grant numbers:ACIF/2017/045,BEFPI/2019/075); National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:5R01EB009041,5R01AG038961); St. Baldrick's Foundation, Star and Storm Foundation; Programa Operativo del Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER) of the Comunitat Valenciana(grant numbers:IDIFEDER/2021/004); Comunitat Valenciana 2014–2020(grant numbers:IDIFEDER/2018/022); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9593797","acoustic hologram;blood-brain barrier opening;brain tumor","Transducers;Ultrasonic imaging;Uncertainty;Targeted drug delivery;Brain modeling;Attenuation;Acoustics","biological effects of acoustic radiation;biomedical transducers;blood;brain;cancer;drug delivery systems;drugs;paediatrics;tumours;ultrasonic therapy;ultrasonic transducers","microbubbles;single-element focused ultrasound;acoustic holograms;pediatric brain tumor;covered tumor volume;off-target coverage;single-element device;tumor coverage;targeted drug delivery;blood-brain barrier;tumor-directed focused ultrasound treatment;sonication duration;chemotherapy treatments;fluid-like tissue simulations;frequency 250 kHz","","1","","16","IEEE","12 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

BCI systems measure specific features of brain activity and translate them into control signals that drive an output. The sensor modalities that have most commonly been used in BCI studies have been electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings from the scalp and single- neuron recordings from within the cortex. Over the past decade, an increasing number of studies has explored the use of electro-corticographic (ECoG) activity recorded directly from the surface of the brain. ECoG has attracted substantial and increasing interest, because it has been shown to reflect specific details of actual and imagined actions, and because its technical characteristics should readily support robust and chronic implementations of BCI systems in humans. This review provides general perspectives on the ECoG platform; describes the different electrophysiological features that can be detected in ECoG; elaborates on the signal acquisition issues, protocols, and online performance of ECoG- based BCI studies to date; presents important limitations of current ECoG studies; discusses opportunities for further research; and finally presents a vision for eventual clinical implementation.

Many studies have shown that the degree of resection significantly influences the time to recurrence and the overall survival of brain tumor patients. Currently, surgical navigation systems and ultrasonography are used intraoperatively to help neurosurgeons locate brain tumor and maximize resection. Despite the applications of these technologies, significant residual tumor mass is often found to be left behind in patients following brain tumor resection. Hence, there is a need for an objective, intraoperative real-time system that is capable of accurately differentiating brain tumors from normal brain tissue, and detecting tumor margins with sub-millimeter spatial resolution.","","978-1-4244-1173-3","10.1109/CLEOPR.2007.4391524","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4391524","","Medical treatment;Neoplasms;Cancer;Oncological surgery;Brain;State estimation;Pediatrics;Navigation;Ultrasonography;Neurosurgery","biomedical optical imaging;brain;patient treatment;tumours","optical guidance;brain therapies;malignant brain tumors;primary brain tumors;brain tumor patients;surgical resection;surgical navigation systems;ultrasonography;residual tumor mass;brain tumor resection;intraoperative real-time system;normal brain tissue;tumor margins;sub-millimeter spatial resolution","","","","","IEEE","4 Dec 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The spontaneous signals along the trajectory were recorded during neurosurgery of PD patients and analyzed post surgery. Our approach applies characterizations and visualization of energy, marginal probability density function, power spectral density, the time-domain signal, the autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation function of the microelectrode recordings at the different depths along the trajectory.

Over the past decades, much effort has been directed toward the graph modeling of SC, in which the brain SC is generally considered as relatively invariant. However, the graph representation of SC is unable to directly describe the connections between anatomically unconnected brain regions and fail to model the negative functional correlations. Here, we extend the static graph model to a spatiotemporal varying hypergraph Laplacian diffusion (STV-HGLD) model to describe the propagation of the spontaneous neural activity in human brain by incorporating the Laplacian of the hypergraph representation of the structural connectome ( ${h}$ SC) into the regular wave equation. Theoretical solution shows that the dynamic functional couplings between brain regions fluctuate in the form of an exponential wave regulated by the spatiotemporal varying Laplacian of  ${h}$ SC. Empirical study suggests that the cortical wave might give rise to resonance with SC during the self-organizing interplay between excitation and inhibition among brain regions, which orchestrates the cortical waves propagating with harmonics emanating from the  ${h}$ SC while being bound by the natural frequencies of SC. Besides, the average statistical dependencies between brain regions, normally defined as the functional connectivity (FC), arises just at the moment before the cortical wave reaches the steady state after the wave spreads across all the brain regions. Comprehensive tests on four extensively studied empirical brain connectome datasets with different resolutions confirm our theory and findings.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2022.3196007","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072468); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9849026","Brain connectivity;structure-function relation;spatiotemporal varying hypergraph Laplacian;wave equation;resonance","Brain modeling;Laplace equations;Correlation;Mathematical models;Propagation;Predictive models;Neural activity","brain;graph theory;neurophysiology;spatiotemporal phenomena;statistical analysis;wave equations","anatomical architecture;anatomically unconnected brain regions;brain structural connectivity;cortical wave;dynamic functional couplings;empirical brain connectome datasets;exponential wave;functional connectivity;graph representation;human brain;hypergraph representation;negative functional correlations;regular wave equation;resting brain functional correlations;spatiotemporal varying hypergraph Laplacian diffusion model;spatiotemporal varying Laplacian ofhSC;spontaneous brain neural activities;static graph model;statistical dependence","Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Connectome;Brain;Rest;Diffusion;Nerve Net","","","44","IEEE","3 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Raman spectroscopy is a promising modality that can provide real time intraoperative data to the surgeon about whether a tissue is normal or cancerous, thus aiding the surgeon in obtaining maximal safe resection. In this paper, we pair Raman spectroscopy with a supervised machine learning technique, support vector machine, to classify fresh tissue samples as solid tumor, infiltrating tumor, necrosis, or normal brain tissue. The support vector machine classifier resulted in 89% accuracy of the 117 tissue samples while delivering real time results.

We studied the low (8–32 Hz) and high-frequency (76–100 Hz) SM cortical ECoG spectral changes associated with contralateral and ipsilateral whole hand and individual finger movement and assessed their discriminability. We find that ipsilateral movement is associated with widespread decreases in the low-frequency band (LFB) and more focal increases in the high-frequency band (HFB). The HFB component discriminates between ipsilateral and contralateral movement-associated activations, in contrast to the LFB. The HFB also discriminates between thumb and index finger movement-associated activations, for both the contralateral and the ipsilateral case, whereas the LFB does not.

The computer aided analysis of MRI is performed to diagnosis the tumor through the process of classifying and segmenting. From the previous years of study, the research areas are mainly concentrated on machine and deep learning for brain malignancy prediction and treatment. The two dimensional MRI images helps to detect and classify the brain cancer precisely and efficiently. Usually the MRI images are two dimensional and not give sufficient knowledge regarding the structure and exact size of the tumor can be removed, and the detection procedure has become more complex. Since two-dimensional images never offer the actual feeling of exactly how a tumor looks, diagnosis includes 3D tumor reconstruction, planning for surgery and biological studies. The survival rate shows gives us an exact picture of the number of patients who have survived after the tumor is identified. The 5-year and 10 year survival rate is approximately 36 percent and 31 percent respectively for persons with a cancerous brain or CNS tumor.

The traditional Fuzzy c means clustering algorithm performs well in the absence of noise. Traditional FCM leads to its non robust result mainly due to 1. Not utilizing the spatial information in the image. 2. Use of Euclidean distance. These limitations can be addressed by using robust spatial kernel FCM (RSKFCM). RSKFCM consider the spatial information and uses Gaussian kernel function to calculate the distance between the center and data points. Though RSKFCM gives good result, the main drawback behind this method is the inability of generating global minima for the objective function. To improve the efficiency of RSKFCM method, in this paper we proposed the genetic algorithm based RSKFCM. By using the genetic algorithm, RSKFCM initializes the cluster centers and reaches the global minima of the objective function. Experimentation is carried out on the standard brain image dataset. Experimental result reveals that the proposed genetic algorithm based RSKFCM outperforms other FCM methods with the use of various cluster validity functions.","","978-1-4799-7171-8","10.1109/CCIP.2015.7100707","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7100707","Segmentation;Clustering;Fuzzy C Means;Genetic algorithm","Image segmentation;Genetic algorithms;Kernel;Clustering algorithms;Robustness;Biomedical imaging;Brain","genetic algorithms;image segmentation;medical image processing;surgery","medical image segmentation;MRI brain images;evolutionary computation technique;traditional Fuzzy c means clustering algorithm;Euclidean distance;robust spatial kernel FCM;Gaussian kernel function;genetic algorithm based RSKFCM method;standard brain image dataset","","3","","39","IEEE","4 May 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

DBS outcome depends on accurate stimulation of the STN sensorimotor area which is a trial-and-error procedure taking place during and after surgery. Pathologically enhanced beta-band (13-35 Hz) oscillatory activity across the cortico-basal ganglia pathways is a prominent neurophysiological phenomenon associated with PD. We hypothesized that weighing together beta-band frequency peaks from simultaneous microelectrode recordings in “off-state” PD patients could map the individual neuroanatomical variability and serve as a biomarker for the location of the STN sensorimotor neurons. We validated our hypothesis with 9 and 11 patients that, respectively, responded well and poorly to bilateral DBS, after at least two years of follow up. We categorized “good” and “poor” DBS responders based on their clinical assessment alongside a > 40% and <;30% change, respectively, in “off” unified PD rating scale motor scores. Good (poor) DBS responders had, in average, 1 mm (3.5 mm) vertical distance between the maximum beta-peak weighted across the parallel microelectrodes and the center of the stimulation area. The distances were statistically different in the two groups (p = 0.0025). Our biomarker could provide personalized intra- and postoperative support in stimulating the STN sensorimotor area associated with optimal long-term clinical benefits.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2014.2344102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6868185","Beta-band oscillations;clinical biomarker;deep brain stimulation (DBS);neuromodulation;Parkinson's disease (PD)","Satellite broadcasting;Microelectrodes;Diseases;Surgery;Oscillators;Trajectory","brain;diseases;neurophysiology;patient treatment","beta band frequency peaks;subthalamic nucleus;biomarker;motor improvement;deep brain stimulation;Parkinson's disease;surgical treatment;STN sensorimotor area;cortico basal ganglia pathways;neurophysiological phenomenon;DBS responders","Beta Rhythm;Biomarkers;Deep Brain Stimulation;Electrodes, Implanted;Electroencephalography;Humans;Intraoperative Neurophysiological Monitoring;Movement Disorders;Parkinson Disease;Prosthesis Implantation;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subthalamic Nucleus;Treatment Outcome","15","","52","IEEE","30 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Calibration of the MER-LDF probe in a standard microsphere solution showed expected LDF pattern. No interferences of the MER probe with the LDF signals could be observed. LDF was also acquired in one Parkinson patient undergoing DBS implantation. LDF data were obtained along the precalculated trajectory i.e. from cortex towards the target in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Results demonstrated the technical feasibility of the combined MER-LDF probe during in-vitro experiences and in one patient. The perfusion signal representing the microcirculation showed stable values with clear peaks from each heartbeat. This agreed with previous investigation using an optical probe without the MER function. Due to the forward-looking probe design, this new technology has a high potential to avoid vessels during MER recording.

When their visual focus is directed at the surgical site, they require an assistant to verbally relay the values. An auditory and visual user interface (UI), which displays measurement values accurately and allows fast and intuitive signal recognition, can improve this procedure. This paper experimentally evaluates an auditory and visual UI for providing real-time measurement feedback during stereotactic brain tumor biopsies. In a user study (n = 15), the accuracy of auditory and visual response was determined using function response tests, and user acceptance was evaluated.

Clinical ECoG arrays use millimeter-scale electrodes and centimeter-scale pitch and cannot precisely map neural activity. Higher-resolution electrodes are of interest for both current clinical applications, providing access to more precise neural activity localization and novel applications, such as neural prosthetics, where current information density and spatial resolution is insufficient to suitably decode signals for a chronic brain-machine interface. Developing such electrodes is not trivial because their small contact area increases the electrode impedance, which seriously affects the signal-to-noise ratio, and adhering such an electrode to the brain surface becomes critical. The most straightforward approach requires increasing the array conformability with flexible substrates while improving the electrode performance using materials with superior electrochemical properties. In this paper, we propose an ultra-flexible and conformable polyimide-based micro-ECoG array of submillimeter recording sites electrochemically coated with high surface area conductive polymer-carbon nanotube composites to improve their brain-electrical coupling capabilities. We characterized our devices both electrochemically and by recording from rat somatosensory cortex in vivo. The performance of the coated and uncoated electrodes was directly compared by simultaneously recording the same neuronal activity during multiwhisker deflection stimulation. Finally, we assessed the effect of electrode size on the extraction of somatosensory evoked potentials and found that in contrast to the normal high-impedance microelectrodes, the recording capabilities of our low-impedance microelectrodes improved upon reducing their size from 0.2 to 0.1 mm.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2014.2342880","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6866220","Electrocorticography (ECoG);flexible microelectrode array;micro-electrocorticography;poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)-carbon nanotube (CNT) coatings","Microelectrodes;Impedance;Polyimides;Coatings;Metals;Surface impedance","biomedical electrodes;biomedical materials;carbon nanotubes;conducting polymers;electroencephalography;microelectrodes","low-impedance microelectrode;high-impedance microelectrode;somatosensory evoked potential;multiwhisker deflection stimulation;neuronal activity;uncoated electrodes;rat somatosensory cortex;brain-electrical coupling capability;carbon nanotube composite;surface area conductive polymer-CNT;submillimeter recording site;conformable polyimide;ultraflexible micro-ECoG array;electrocorticography;PEDOT-CNT coating;size 0.2 mm to 0.1 mm","Animals;Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic;Brain;Brain Mapping;Brain-Computer Interfaces;Electric Impedance;Electrochemical Techniques;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Electrophysiological Phenomena;Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory;Male;Microelectrodes;Nanotubes, Carbon;Physical Stimulation;Polymers;Rats;Rats, Long-Evans;Signal-To-Noise Ratio;Vibrissae","71","","47","IEEE","25 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A unified optical processing method combining image dynamic block idea and HIS transform is proposed. The image is dynamically divided into high-light sub-blocks, ordinary sub-blocks and excessive sub-sub-blocks, and then these sub-blocks are homogenized by HIS transform. Finally, the processed sub-blocks are linearly stretched to ensure the entire frame, and the MASK-based algorithm is analyzed. And several improved algorithms for remote sensing image homogenization algorithms. Experiments show that the MASK-based gradient stretching algorithm and the mean and variance based remote sensing image homogenization algorithm can achieve better uniformity, but there will be blur or color deviation.

To cope with the inevitable intensity in homogeneity problem of MR images, based on the techniques of curve evolution and level sets, a novel curve evaluation method employing neighboring information was proposed in this paper. An energy function was defined with a local intensity fitting term, which adopted the local information in the neighborhood of the interested pixels, and greatly improved the boundary recognition accuracy for low contrast areas. A numerical algorithm using finite difference is also presented. Finally, the method was tested by several experiments on MR images. Experimental results indicate the proposed algorithm is effective for segmenting MR images corrupted by intensity inhomogeneity, and usually outperforms the corresponding conventional methods. The proposed model could also be applied in segmentation of ordinary inhomogeneous images which is very common in reality.","","978-0-7695-3735-1","10.1109/FSKD.2009.363","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5360615","","Image segmentation;Curve fitting;Magnetic resonance;Application software;Pathology;Path planning;Surgery;Level set;Finite difference methods;Testing","biomedical MRI;brain;curve fitting;finite difference methods;image segmentation;medical image processing","image segmentation;intensity fitting curve evolution;brain magnetic resonance;level sets;boundary recognition accuracy;numerical algorithm;finite difference","","","","19","IEEE","28 Dec 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Following implantation of a stent-electrode array (Stentrode) in a large animal model, we investigated the longevity of high-quality signals, by measuring bandwidth in animals implanted for up to six months; no signal degradation was observed. We also investigated whether bandwidth was influenced by implant location with respect to the superior sagittal sinus and branching cortical veins; it was not. Finally, we assessed whether electrode orientation had an impact on recording quality. There was no significant difference in bandwidths from electrodes facing different orientations. Interestingly, electrodes facing the skull (180°) were still able to record neural information with high fidelity. Consequently, a minimally invasive surgical approach combined with a stent-electrode array is a safe and efficacious technique to acquire neural signals over a chronic duration.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-3646-6","10.1109/EMBC.2018.8512385","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8512385","","Electrodes;Bandwidth;Animals;Surgery;Veins;Implants;Brain-computer interfaces","biomedical electrodes;biomedical electronics;brain;medical signal detection;neurophysiology;stents;surgery","electrode orientation;chronically implanted endovascular stent-electrode array;open brain surgery;implant location;recording quality;implant duration;anatomical location;cerebral vessels;Stentrode;animal model;high-quality signals;sagittal sinus;branching cortical veins;neural information;minimally invasive surgical approach;neural signal acquisition;chronic duration","Animals;Brain;Cerebral Cortex;Electrodes, Implanted;Stents","","","17","IEEE","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To perform this operation, hardware combination of a benchtop spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and a high-power laser has been implemented by a customized fiber combiner. By the double-clad fiber out of the combiner which works as both the OCT sample arm fiber and the ablation laser output fiber, an in situ theranostics process without registration can be conducted. The SD-OCT image analysis from both en face and depth perspectives shows the structural information intuitively and accordingly generate the ablation-guiding grid. Based on the grid, the continuous wave high-power laser ablates ex vivo porcine brain models in submillimeter automatically.

Focused ultrasound (FUS) coupled with the administration of microbubbles has been proved to open the BBB locally, transiently, and noninvasively both in rodents and in nonhuman-primates (NHPs). The development of this disruption technique independent of MRI monitoring is of primordial importance yet restrained to the targeting optimization. This paper establishes the linear relationship of the incidence angle with the volume of BBB opening (VBBB) and the peak negative pressure when sonicating the caudate nucleus and the putamen region of five NHPs. In addition, the effect of central nervous system structures on the opening morphology is evaluated by identification of the grayto-white-matter ratio at the opening site. Finally, the targeting accuracy is assessed through the estimation of the geometric and angle shift of the opening from the targeted region. Interestingly, results prove a monotonic increase of the opening volume with close to normal incidence angles. Moreover, 80.35% of the opening lies on gray-matter regions compared with only 19.41% attributed to the white matter. The opening was found to be shifted axially, toward the transducer, and laterally with an average angle shift of 4.5°. Finally, we were capable of showing reproducibility of targeting accuracy with the same stereotactic and ultrasonic parameters. This paper documents the a priori prediction of the opening volume through manipulation of the angle and pressure as well as establishing the predictability, accuracy, and safety of FUS-induced BBB opening in NHPs.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2017.2681695","National Institute of Health(grant numbers:RO1-AG038961,EB009041); Focused Ultrasound Surgery Foundation; Wallace H.

TBI, termed the “silent epidemic” is becoming a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. There is currently no effective diagnostic tool for TBI, and yet, early-intervention is known to considerably shorten hospital stays, improve outcomes, fasten neurological recovery and lower mortality rates, highlighting the unmet need for techniques capable of rapid and accurate point-of-care diagnostics, implemented in the earliest stages.

Brain-machine interface (BMI) emerges as a potential candidate, by allowing patients to use their own brain activity to reestablish sensorimotor control of paralyzed body parts. BMI can be divided in two main groups: non-invasive, based in the capture of the neuronal signal over the cranium, and invasive, much more effective in generating high resolution brain-derived motor control signals, despite requiring a brain surgery for implantation of recording microelectrodes. Accordingly, chronic multielectrodes implants define the fundamental component of an invasive BMI. However, it is important to characterize the impact of microwire arrays' implant on the nervous tissue before this technique can be available to human clinical trials. Here we evaluated the expression of immediate early-gene c-fos and inflammatory response (astrogliosis), as well as the quality of the neuronal signal comparing the variation of the total number and the amplitude of the recorded units after long-lasting chronic multielectrode implants. Electrode recordings remained viable for 6 months after implant, and did not alter the general physiology of the implanted tissue, as revealed by normal c-Fos expression in implanted sites.

We then image fixed mouse brain tissues at varying update rates and compare the resulting mosaics.

For the full-wave simulation, three different mappings between CT Hounsfield units and the longitudinal speed of sound inside the skull were tested. All methods are compared with the exact same setup due to transfer matrices acquired with the clinical system for N = 5 skulls and T = 2 different targets for each skull. We show that the clinical ray-tracing software and the full-wave simulation restore, respectively, 84% ± 5% and 86% ± 5% of the pressure obtained with hydrophone-based correction for targets located in central brain regions. On the second target (off-center), we also report that the performance of both algorithms degrades when the average incident angles of the acoustic beam at the skull surface increase.

Our proposed method correlates cortical surfaces based on groupwise white matter connectivity characteristics via a fiber clustering scheme. Unlike other parcellation methods, correspondence of cortical surface vertices is not required. Thus the proposed method can be applied to datasets of patients with brain tumors, using an approximate cortical surface such as a white matter/gray matter boundary derived from diffusion anisotropy.

Three-dimensional intraoperative ultrasound color-Doppler imaging has proven useful in this respect. However, due to Doppler angle-dependencies and the complexity of the vascular architecture, clinical valuable 3-D information of flow direction and velocity is currently not available. In this work, we aim to correct for angle-dependencies in 3-D flow images based on a geometric model of the neurovascular tree generated on-the-fly from free-hand 2-D imaging and an accurate position sensor system. The 3-D vessel model acts as a priori information of vessel orientation used to angle-correct the Doppler measurements, as well as provide an estimate of the average flow direction. Based on the flow direction we were also able to do aliasing correction to approximately double the measurable velocity range. In vitro experiments revealed a high accuracy and robustness for estimating the mean direction of flow. Accurate angle-correction of axial velocities were possible given a sufficient beam-to-flow angle for at least parts of a vessel segment . In vitro experiments showed an absolute relative bias of 9.5% for a challenging low-flow scenario. The method also showed promising results in vivo, improving the depiction of flow in the distal branches of intracranial aneurysms and the feeding arteries of an arteriovenous malformation.

We exploited the canonical correlation analysis that infers the amount of information on the propofol requirements. The results showed that the preoperative EEG included the factor that could explain the propofol requirements. Specifically, the frontal and posterior regions had crucial information on the propofol requirements. Moreover, there was a significantly different power in the frontal and posterior regions between baseline and unconsciousness periods, unlike the alpha power in the central region.

In order to refine the resection of gliomas, we are developing a novel intraoperative probe specifically dedicated to the localization of residual tumor after the bulk has been excised. The probe, built around clear and plastic scintillating fibers, was designed to detect positrons emitted from radiolabeled brain tissue in order to discriminate more specifically neoplastic from normal tissues. The probe was also built to be directly coupled to the excision tool leading to simultaneous detection and removal of tumor. We report here performances of the first radio-isotopic configuration of the intraoperative probe which consists of a detection head composed of eight detection elements held around the excision tool in a closed packed annular arrangement. This head is coupled to an optic fiber bundle that exports the scintillating light to a multi-channel photomultiplier tube. The gamma ray background generated by the annihilation of beta+ in tissues is eliminated by a real-time subtraction method. The detector exhibits a beta sensitivity of 139 cps/kBq and a gamma ray rejection efficiency of 99.5%. The ability of the probe to detect residual lesions was evaluated with a realistic brain phantom representing the surgical cavity and the boundaries of the tumor. We showed that lesions as small as 5 mm in diameter can be detected for tumor to normal tissue uptake ratios of fluorinated tracers greater than 3.5. This ratio is achieved with radiopharmaceuticals like 18F-FET or 18F-choline. These promising results suggest that the features of our system are compatible with in situ localization of residual radiolabeled tumors.","1558-1578","","10.1109/TNS.2008.924080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4545076","Beta probe;glioma;multi-modality detection;optical fibers;radio-guided surgery","Probes;Surgery;Neoplasms;Lesions;Medical treatment;Plastics;Positrons;Brain;Optical coupling;Biomedical optical imaging","brain;phantoms;radioactive tracers;radioisotope imaging;surgery;tumours","glioma radioguided surgery;intraoperative beta probe;brain tumor;radio-isotopic configuration;positron head;optic fiber;multichannel photomultiplier tube;real-time subtraction method;residual lesions;brain phantom;fluorinated tracers","","14","","46","IEEE","17 Jun 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The gVAE was enriched with Sequential Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and perceptual loss to learn temporal rsfMRI features and smooth the reconstructed signals. Using a cross-validation approach on healthy controls, our best model yielded an average spatial correlation of 0.791 and an average temporal correlation of 0.793. When applied to PWE, the average and spatial correlation decreased to 0.752 and 0.750 respectively. Our findings pave the path to the development of a whole brain data-driven tool that may be valuable for the characterization of abnormalities within the epileptic brain.

In this experiment, we used supervised learning techniques in an attempt to distinguish HFOs occurring during versus outside of seizures in five patients implanted with intracranial micro-and macroelectrodes as part of routine evaluation for epilepsy surgery. We trained three classifiers using logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines, respectively, and assessed their performance using the F1 measure in conjunction with permutation testing. All of the classifiers produced a low number of true positives relative to false positives and false negatives, but two of the classifiers performed slightly better than chance in certain patients. These results suggest that ictal HFOs are difficult to distinguish from those occurring interictally, and that a marked change in HFO morphology is not likely to be associated with seizure generation.","1058-6393","978-1-4673-0323-1","10.1109/ACSSC.2011.6190042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6190042","","Hafnium compounds;Support vector machines;Electrodes;Epilepsy;Oscillators;Humans;Aggregates","biological tissues;biomedical electrodes;brain;diseases;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;microelectrodes;neurophysiology;pattern classification;regression analysis;support vector machines;surgery","high-frequency brain oscillation;epileptic seizure;transient high-frequency oscillation;human brain;biomarker;epileptogenic brain tissue;seizure generation;supervised learning;intracranial microelectrodes;intracranial macroelectrodes;epilepsy surgery;logistic regression;k-nearest neighbor;support vector machine;F1 measure;permutation testing;classifier;HFO morphology;frequency 100 Hz to 500 Hz","","","","12","IEEE","26 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we performed cross-modal validation of epileptogenic network defined by SEEG and that by resting-state fMRI on individual brain of epilepsy patients. Epileptogenicity index (EI) based on abnormal high frequency SEEG signals was employed to define the epileptogenic network in electrophysiology. Meanwhile, taking the SEEG sites with highest EI as the seed, resting-state functional MRI and connectivity analysis were used to define the epileptogenic network in hemodynamics. The spatial consistency of these two networks was measured by ROC, and the average AUC reached 0.87, which proved a good consistency between electrophysiological and hemodynamic networks in epileptic brain.

High-frequency oscillations (HFOs, > 80 Hz) are promising biomarkers of the EZ that are typically localized using intracranial electroencephalography (icEEG). The goal of this study was to localize the cortical generators of HFOs non-invasively using high-density (HD) EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) and validate the localization against the gold-standard given by the icEEGdefined HFO-zone. Methods: We analyzed simultaneous HDEEG and MEG data from six children with MRE who underwent icEEG and surgery. We detected interictal HFOs (80-160 Hz) on HD-EEG and MEG separately, using an inhouse automatic detector followed by visual human review, and distinguished between HFOs with and without spikes. We localized the cortical generators of each HFO on HD-EEG or MEG using the wavelet Maximum Entropy on the Mean (wMEM). For the HFOs localized in the brain area covered by icEEG, we estimated the localization error (Eloc) with respect to the gold-standard, and classified them as either concordant (Eloc≤15mm) or not. Results: We found that: (i) HD-EEG presented a higher rate of HFOs than MEG (1 vs 0.5 HFOs/min, p=0.031); (ii) HFOs without spikes were more likely to be localized outside the brain regions of interest (i.e. covered by icEEG) than HFOs with spikes; and (iii) both HD-EEG and MEG showed high precision to the gold-standard (92% and 96%). Conclusion: We reported quantitative evidence that HDEEG and MEG can localize the HFO cortical generators with high precision to the icEEG gold-standard in children with MRE, suggesting that they may possibly limit the need for icEEG prior to surgery. We also showed that HFOs with spikes on HD-EEG/MEG are more likely to be epileptogenic than those independent from spikes, which may represent physiological events from normal brain.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-1311-5","10.1109/EMBC.2019.8857793","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8857793","","Hafnium oxide;Pediatrics;Surgery;Electroencephalography;Generators;Biomedical imaging","bioelectric potentials;biomedical electrodes;electroencephalography;entropy;magnetoencephalography;medical disorders;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;paediatrics;surgery","epileptogenic zone;brain area;magnetoencephalography;surgical resection;MEG data analysis;HDEEG data analysis;HFO cortical generators;localization error;high-density EEG;intracranial electroencephalography;medically refractory epilepsy;children;high-frequency oscillations;frequency 80.0 Hz to 160.0 Hz","Child;Electrocorticography;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Humans;Magnetoencephalography","5","","18","IEEE","7 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Electrode placement is determined from two coordinates in postoperative medical imaging and electric conductivity is assigned from preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and patient-specific DBS data. Simulations are performed using the equation for steady currents in Comsol Multiphysics (CM). The simulated EF is superimposed on the preoperative MRI for evaluation of affected structures. The method is demonstrated with patient-specific simulations in the zona incerta and a globus pallidus example containing cysts with higher conductive which causes considerable distortion of the EF.

Especially, its counterpart in frequency domain, spectral GC, as well as other Granger-like causality measures have recently been applied to study causal interactions between brain areas in different frequency ranges during cognitive and perceptual tasks. In this paper, we show that: 1) GC in time domain cannot correctly determine how strongly one time series influences the other when there is directional causality between two time series, and 2) spectral GC and other Granger-like causality measures have inherent shortcomings and/or limitations because of the use of the transfer function (or its inverse matrix) and partial information of the linear regression model. On the other hand, we propose two novel causality measures (in time and frequency domains) for the linear regression model, called new causality and new spectral causality, respectively, which are more reasonable and understandable than GC or Granger-like measures. Especially, from one simple example, we point out that, in time domain, both new causality and GC adopt the concept of proportion, but they are defined on two different equations where one equation (for GC) is only part of the other (for new causality), thus the new causality is a natural extension of GC and has a sound conceptual/theoretical basis, and GC is not the desired causal influence at all. By several examples, we confirm that new causality measures have distinct advantages over GC or Granger-like measures. Finally, we conduct event-related potential causality analysis for a subject with intracranial depth electrodes undergoing evaluation for epilepsy surgery, and show that, in the frequency domain, all measures reveal significant directional event-related causality, but the result from new spectral causality is consistent with event-related time-frequency power spectrum activity. The spectral GC as well as other Granger-like measures are shown to generate misleading results. The proposed new causality measures may have wide potential applications in economics and neuroscience.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2011.2123917","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5751700","Event-related potential;Granger or Granger-like causality;linear regression model;new causality;power spectrum","Time series analysis;Linear regression;Noise;Frequency domain analysis;Biological system modeling;Brain modeling;Time domain analysis","causality;neurophysiology;regression analysis;time series;transfer functions","causality analysis;neural connectivity;Granger causality;causality influence;time series;economics;neuroscience;frequency domain;spectral GC;brain areas;transfer function;inverse matrix;linear regression model;causality measures;spectral causality;intracranial depth electrodes;epilepsy surgery","Algorithms;Cognition;Computer Simulation;Evoked Potentials;Linear Models;Neural Networks (Computer);Perception","45","","48","IEEE","19 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the current study, we proposed a 76-channel EEG system for the long-term monitoring of epilepsy patients, and proposed a dynamic seizure imaging (DSI) technique to image the ictal rhythmic activity that may evolve through time, space and frequency. We tested the system in a cohort of 8 patients and our results show that the DSI estimated the seizure activity in good correlation with intracranial recordings, successful surgery outcomes and other clinical evidence. The proposed dense-array recording and DSI imaging approach enable a non-invasive but quantitative imaging of continuous seizure activity.

In this study, a high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) combined with blood drug concentration and behavioral response indicators was used to monitor propofol-induced sedation and evaluate the alterations in consciousness states. Microstate analysis, which can reflect the semi-stable state of the sub-second activation of the brain functional network, can be used to assess the brain’s consciousness states. In this research, the EEG microstate sequences were constructed to compare the characteristics of corresponding sequences. Compared with the baseline (BS) state, the microstate sequences in the moderate sedation (MD) state exhibited higher complexity indexes of the multiscale sample entropy. With respect to the transition probability (TP) of microstates, most microstates tended to be converted into microstate C in the BS state. In contrast, they tended to be converted into microstate F in the MD state. The significant difference between the expected TP and observed TP could lead to the conclusion that hidden layers were present when there were changes in the consciousness states. According to the hidden Markov model, the accuracy of distinguishing the BS and MD states was 80.16%. The characteristics of microstate sequence revealed the variations in the brain states caused by alterations in consciousness states during anesthesia from a new perspective and presented a new idea for monitoring the DOA.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2022.3182705","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:32071372,31571000,61471291,81201162); Sichuan Province Science and Technology Support Program(grant numbers:2022yfs0030); Natural Science Basic Research Program of Shaanxi through the Program(grant numbers:2020JM-037); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9795112","Microstate sequence analysis;EEG;propofol-induced sedation;multiscale sample entropy;hidden markov model","Electroencephalography;Monitoring;Entropy;Biomedical monitoring;Anesthesia;Time series analysis;Task analysis","blood;electroencephalography;entropy;hidden Markov models;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;surgery","semistable state;EEG microstate sequences;baseline state;microstate sequence;BS state;MD state;brain states;propofol-induced alterations;brain consciousness states;propofol-induced sedation;microstate analysis;high-density electroencephalogram;transition probability","Brain;Brain Mapping;Consciousness;Electroencephalography;Humans;Propofol","2","","46","CCBY","13 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We assessed the system with 50 MER trajectories from 26 PD patients who have undergone DBS surgery. The signals are pre-processed and subjected to six-level wavelet decomposition. Then, the entropy is computed from the detailed and approximate coefficients. These features are fed to the random forest classifier and the model is evaluated by leave one patient out cross-validation. The results show that entropy associated with detailed wavelet coefficients (D1and D2) are higher in STN where as it is lower in other wavelet scales.

In this paper, we proposed a novel Gaussian weighted Laplace prior (GWLP) regularization method. It considered the variance of the bioluminescence energy between any two voxels inside an organ had a non-linear inverse relationship with their Gaussian distance to solve the over-smoothed tumor morphology in BLT reconstruction. We compared the GWLP with conventional Tikhonov and Laplace regularization methods through various numerical simulations and in vivo orthotopic glioma mouse model experiments. The in vivo magnetic resonance imaging and ex vivo green fluorescent protein images and hematoxylin-eosin stained images of whole head cryoslicing specimens were utilized as gold standards. The results demonstrated that GWLP achieved the highest accuracy in tumor localization and tumor morphology preservation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that achieved such accurate BLT morphological reconstruction of orthotopic glioma without using any segmented tumor structure from any other structural imaging modalities as the prior for reconstruction guidance.

This study evaluates a feature set created for the detection of tremor - a cardinal symptom of PD. The designed feature set was based on standard signal features and researched properties of the electrical signals recorded from subthalamic nucleus (STN) within the basal ganglia, which together included temporal, spectral, statistical, autocorrelation and fractal properties. The most characterized tremor related features were selected using statistical testing and backward algorithms then used for classification on unseen patient signals. The spectral features were among the most efficient at detecting tremor, notably spectral bands 3.5-5.5 Hz and 0-1 Hz proved to be highly significant.

(3) microchip implementation of neural system models-can the mathematical model be realized as a set of electronic circuits to achieve parallel processing, rapid computational speed, and miniaturization? and (4) creation of hybrid neuron-silicon interfaces-can structural and functional connections between electronic devices and neural tissue be achieved for long-term, bi-directional communication with the brain? By integrating solutions to these component problems, we are realizing a microchip-based model of hippocampal nonlinear dynamics that can perform the same function as part of the hippocampus. Through bi-directional communication with other neural tissue that normally provides the inputs and outputs to/from a damaged hippocampal area, the biomimetic model could serve as a neural prosthesis. A proof-of-concept will be presented in which the CA3 region of the hippocampal slice is surgically removed and is replaced by a microchip model of CA3 nonlinear dynamics-the ""hybrid"" hippocampal circuit displays normal physiological properties. How the work in brain slices is being extended to behaving animals also will be described.","1941-1189","","10.1109/RBME.2008.2008687","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724210","Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs);brain-machine interfaces (BMIs);cognitive/memory prostheses;deep brain stimulation (DBS);motor system prostheses;multi-site electrode arrays;neural prosthesis;neurotechnology;neurotrophic factors;nonlinear systems analysis;Parkinson's disease;rehabilitation;site-specific drug delivery","Hippocampus;Mathematical model;Prosthetics;Biological system modeling;Predictive models;Bidirectional control;Epilepsy;Dementia;Alzheimer's disease;Neurons","biological tissues;biomedical electronics;biomimetics;brain-computer interfaces;cellular biophysics;cognition;diseases;man-machine systems;medical computing;neural nets;neurophysiology;patient rehabilitation;prosthetics;surgery","neurotechnology;multidisciplinary project;microchip-based neural prosthesis;hippocampus;brain response;Alzheimer's disease;neural network function;neuron;biologically realistic model;electronic circuit;hybrid neuron-silicon interface;neural tissue;biomimetic model;brain-computer interface;brain-machine interface;cognitive memory prostheses;patient rehabilitation;epilepsy;dementia","Alzheimer Disease;Alzheimer Disease;Animals;Epilepsy;Epilepsy;Hippocampus;Humans;Memory, Long-Term;Miniaturization;Models, Neurological;Neural Prostheses;Stroke;Stroke","19","","287","IEEE","29 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Electrocorticography (ECoG)-based Real Time Functional Mapping (RTFM) has been shown to be a safer alternative to the electrical cortical stimulation mapping (ESM), which is currently the clinical/gold standard. Conventional methods for analyzing RTFM signals are based on statistical comparison of signal power at certain frequency bands. Compared to gold standard (ESM), they have limited accuracies when assessing channel responses. In this study, we address the accuracy limitation of the current RTFM signal estimation methods by analyzing the full frequency spectrum of the signal and replacing signal power estimation methods with machine learning algorithms, specifically random forest (RF), as a proof of concept. We train RF with power spectral density of the time-series RTFM signal in supervised learning framework where ground truth labels are obtained from the ESM. Results obtained from RTFM of six adult patients in a strictly controlled experimental setup reveal the state of the art detection accuracy of ≈78% for the language comprehension task, an improvement of 23% over the conventional RTFM estimation method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study exploring the use of machine learning approaches for determining RTFM signal characteristics, and using the whole-frequency band for better region localization. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of machine learning based RTFM signal analysis method over the full spectrum to be a clinical routine in the near future.","","978-1-5386-1645-1","10.1109/SMC.2017.8122658","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8122658","Epilepsy;Machine Learning;ECoG;RTFM;Random Forest","Radio frequency;Epilepsy;Standards;Electrodes;Frequency control;Surgery","bioelectric phenomena;brain;cognition;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;medical disorders;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;surgery;time series","power spectral density;time-series RTFM signal;supervised learning framework;ESM;adult patients;language comprehension task;conventional RTFM estimation method;machine learning approaches;whole-frequency band;region localization;RTFM signal analysis method;automatic response assessment;language cortex;epilepsy patients;ECoG;accurate localization;brain regions;cognitive functions;electrical cortical stimulation mapping;RTFM signals;statistical comparison;frequency bands;accuracy limitation;current RTFM signal estimation methods;frequency spectrum;machine learning algorithms;specifically random forest;RF;detection accuracy;channel responses;RTFM signal characteristics;Real Time Functional Mapping;clinical-gold standard;signal power estimation methods;random forest;clinical routine;Electrocorticography","","1","","17","IEEE","30 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Dynamic imaging of coherent sources (DICS) was used to find the coherent sources in the brain. The capability of the source analysis to detect deep sources like STN in the brain using EEG data was tested with two model dipole simulations. The simulations were concentrated on two aspects, the angle of the dipole orientation and the disturbance of the cortical areas on locating subcortical regions. In all the DBS treated Parkinsonian tremor patients the power spectrum showed a clear peak at the stimulated frequency and followed by there harmonics. The DBS stimulated frequency constituted a network of primary sensory motor cortex, supplementary motor area, prefrontal cortex, diencephalon, cerebellum and brainstem. Thus the STN was located in the region of the diencephalon.

In parallel, closed-loop neuromodulation strategies have been applied to treat brain conditions including drug-resistant depression, Parkinson’s Disease, and epilepsy. In this study, we seek to apply control theoretical principles to achieve closed loop modulation of hippocampal oscillatory activity. We focus on hippocampal gamma power, a signal with an established association for episodic memory processing, which may be a promising ‘biomarker’ for the modulation of memory performance. To develop a closed-loop stimulation paradigm that effectively modulates hippocampal gamma power, we use a novel data-set in which open-loop stimulation was applied to the posterior cingulate cortex and hippocampal gamma power was recorded during the encoding of episodic memories. The dataset was used to design and evaluate a linear quadratic integral (LQI) servo-controller in order to determine its viability for in-vivo use. In our simulation framework, we demonstrate that applying an LQI servo controller based on an autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) plant model achieves effective control of hippocampal gamma power in 15 out of 17 experimental subjects. We demonstrate that we are able to modulate gamma power using stimulation thresholds that are physiologically safe and on time scales that are reasonable for application in a clinical system. We outline further experimentation to test our proposed system and compare our findings to emerging closed-loop neuromodulation strategies.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2022.3192170","National Institutes of Health (NIH)(grant numbers:R01NS107357,R01NS125250); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9832641","Hippocampus;gamma oscillations;closed-loop modulation;open-loop stimulation;posterior cingulate cortex","Brain modeling;Encoding;Task analysis;Neuromodulation;Electrodes;Predictive models;Recording","brain;closed loop systems;diseases;medical disorders;neurophysiology","control-theoretical system;modulating hippocampal gamma oscillations;posterior cingulate cortex;targeted modulation;episodic memory restoration;closed-loop neuromodulation strategies;brain conditions including drug-resistant depression;closed loop modulation;hippocampal oscillatory activity;hippocampal gamma power;episodic memory processing;closed-loop stimulation paradigm;open-loop stimulation;linear quadratic integral servo-controller;LQI servo controller;Parkinson disease","Brain;Deep Brain Stimulation;Gyrus Cinguli;Hippocampus;Humans;Memory, Episodic","1","","45","CCBY","18 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For focal MRE, seizures originate in the epileptogenic zone (EZ), which is the minimum amount of cortex that must be treated to be seizure free. Localizing the EZ is often a laborious process wherein clinicians first inspect scalp EEG recordings during several seizure events, and then formulate an implantation plan for subsequent invasive monitoring. The goal of implantation is to place electrodes into the brain region covering the EZ. Then, during invasive monitoring, clinicians visually inspect intracranial EEG recordings to more precisely localize the EZ. Finally, the EZ is then surgically ablated, removed or treated with electrical stimulation. Unfortunately success rates average at 50%. Such grim outcomes call for analytical assistance in creating more accurate implantation plans from scalp EEG. In this paper, we introduce a method that combines imaging data (CT and MRI scans) with scalp EEG to derive an implantation distribution. Specifically, scalp EEG data recorded over a seizure event is converted into a time-gamma frequency map, which is then processed to derive a spectrally annotated implantation distribution (SAID). The SAID represents a distribution of gamma power in each of eight cortical lobe/hemisphere partitions. We applied this method to 4 MRE patients who underwent treatment, and found that the SAID distribution overlapped more with clinical implantations in success cases than in failed cases. These preliminary findings suggest that the SAID may help in improving EZ localization accuracy and surgical outcomes.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-1311-5","10.1109/EMBC.2019.8857241","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8857241","","Electroencephalography;Scalp;Electrodes;Surgery;Magnetic resonance imaging;Computed tomography;Epilepsy","biomedical electrodes;biomedical MRI;computerised tomography;electroencephalography;medical disorders;medical image processing;neurophysiology","structural imaging data;functional scalp;epilepsy patients;refractory epilepsy;focal MRE;epileptogenic zone;seizure event;subsequent invasive monitoring;brain region;intracranial EEG recordings;time-gamma frequency map;spectrally annotated implantation distribution;clinical implantations;EZ localization accuracy;invasive EEG implantations;MRE patients;inspect scalp EEG recordings;electrical stimulation;MRI scans;CT scans;cortical lobe-hemisphere partitions;underwent treatment","Brain Mapping;Electrocorticography;Electroencephalography;Epilepsies, Partial;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Scalp;Seizures;Tomography, X-Ray Computed","","","23","IEEE","7 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, many researchers put heavily handcraft feature extraction or carefully tailored feature engineering to each patient to achieve very high sensitivity and low false prediction rate for a particular dataset. This limits the benefit of the proposed approaches if a different dataset is used. Recently, representations learned using the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for object recognition are becoming a widely used model of the processing hierarchy in the human visual system. The correspondence between models and brain signals that holds the acquired activity at high temporal resolution has been explored less exhaustively. In this paper, deep learning CNN with a range of different architectures is designed for identifying related activities from raw electroencephalography (EEG). Specifically, an improved short-time Fourier transform is used to stand for the time-frequency information after extracting the spectral images of the original EEG as input to CNN. Then CNN models are designed and trained to predict the DOA levels from EEG spectrum without handcrafted features, which presents an intuitive mapping process with high efficiency and reliability. As a result, the best trained CNN model achieved an accuracy of 93.50%, interpreted as CNN's deep learning to approximate the DOA by senior anesthesiologists, which highlights the potential of deep CNN combined with advanced visualization techniques for EEG-based brain mapping.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2912273","Lenovo Technology B.V.

MEG has been approved as an efficient and powerful functional detection method which has been used in clinical practices relate with epilepsy, depression, and other diseases that cannot be well-diagnosed by traditional structural methods, e.g., CT and MRI. By using MEG, very weak magnetic signals typically in the range of 10 femtotesla (fT)-1 picotesla (pT) that originate from electric currents flowing in neurons, can be recorded. Compared with scalp EEG, MEG provides much better spatial resolution. Meanwhile, MEG is a noninvasive technology for preoperative workup for epilepsy surgery, which means it may replace traditional invasive methods. As the development of high-sampling rate MEG systems as well as the discovery high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in the brain, MEG is now typically digitally analyzed in very high-frequency range. Although MEG has been clinically used for two decades, it is not so widely-used as EEG. The lack of a powerful software platform is an important reason which hinders the development of MEG. A MEG-specific software, MEG processor, was released here. With the friendly graphical user interface (GUI) of MEG Processor, researcher can easily identify/mark HFOs and project the signal to MRI receiving a precise 3D reconstruction. We hope such a platform will help and encourage more clinicians to uncover the magnificent features of MEG.","","978-1-7281-4855-7","10.1109/ICMIPE47306.2019.9098164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9098164","","Time-frequency analysis;Three-dimensional displays;Software;Data visualization;Electroencephalography;Magnetic resonance imaging","diseases;electroencephalography;graphical user interfaces;image reconstruction;magnetoencephalography;medical image processing;neurophysiology;surgery","MEG high-frequency oscillations identification;efficient detection method;powerful functional detection method;high-sampling rate MEG systems;MEG-specific software;MEG processor;epilepsy surgery;friendly graphical user interface;GUI;3D reconstruction;electric current flow;neurons;human brain","","","","7","IEEE","22 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

DBS is an accepted treatment for individuals living with Parkinson's Disease (PD). This surgery involves implantation of a permanent electrode inside the STN to deliver electrical current. Since the STN is a very small region inside the brain, accurate placement of an electrode is a challenging task for the surgical team. Prior to placement of the permanent electrode, microelectrode recordings of brain activity are used intraoperatively to localize the STN. The placement of the electrode and the success of the therapy depend on this location. In this paper, an objective approach is implemented to help the surgical team in localizing the STN. This is achieved by processing the MER signals and extracting features during the surgery to be used in a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm for defining the neurophysiological borders of the STN. For this purpose, a new classification approach is proposed with the goal of detecting both the dorsal and the ventral borders of the STN during the surgical procedure. Results collected from 100 PD patients in this study, show that by calculating and extracting wavelet transformation features from MER signals and using a data-driven computational deep neural network model, it is possible to detect the borders of the STN with an accuracy of 92%. The proposed method can be implemented in real-time during the surgery to model the neurophysiological nonlinearity along the path of the electrode trajectory during insertion.","2168-2372","","10.1109/JTEHM.2020.2969152","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(grant numbers:RGPIN 1345); AGE-WELL(grant numbers:AW CRP 2015-WP5.3); Canada Research Chairs; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8976150","Deep brain stimulation;deep neural network;intraoperative localization of STN;Parkinson’s disease","Surgery;Feature extraction;Satellite broadcasting;Microelectrodes;Machine learning algorithms;Wavelet transforms","bioelectric phenomena;biomedical electrodes;brain;diseases;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;microelectrodes;neural nets;neurophysiology;surgery;wavelet transforms","wavelet transformation feature extraction;neurophysiological borders;machine learning algorithm;MER signal;electrical current;Parkinson disease;microelectrode recording;subthalamic nucleus;data-driven model;intraoperative localization;data-driven computational deep neural network model;surgical team;permanent electrode;microelectrode recordings;deep brain stimulation surgery;DBS surgery;STN","","11","","23","CCBY","30 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

CARS microscopy is a highly desirable tool to provide real-time information e.g. in brain-cancer surgery [1] due to its label-free chemical imaging capabilities of living tissue. Still a widespread use in real-world applications has not been achieved due to the lack of suitable laser sources. Today widely used CARS laser sources based on Ti:Sapphire and parametric frequency conversion in bulk crystals are expensive and large while their operation requires technical staff devoted to alignment and maintenance. This restricts the application of CARS microscopy to specialized research laboratories only.In this contribution an all-fiber, hence alignment-free, CARS laser source and its application to CARS microscopy is presented. Key components in our setup are a passively mode-locked fiber oscillator delivering nearly transform-limited 50ps pulses at an optimized repetition rate of 2MHz, a fiber integrated amplification system and a fiber optical parametric frequency conversion stage using degenerate four-wave-mixing (FWM) in an endlessly single-mode fiber [2]. In addition we present a seeded FWM CARS source with an extremely high spectral resolution. The cw seed enhances the resolution more than one order of magnitude and allows for distinguishing between CH2 and CH3 resonances. Due to the long pulse durations of the generated signal and pump pulses the temporal walk-off is negligible which makes them ideal for fiber delivery, e.g. to the microscope, without complex delay lines. This enhances the simplicity greatly and makes this source particularly easy to use. 2. Experiment and results The mode-locked 50ps all-fiber oscillator was optimized to run at 2 MHz to avoid photo damage and provide enough peak power for the CARS process (fig.1a). An Yb-doped single-clad fiber amplifier boosts the average power up to 0.5W. The active fiber is spliced to the conversion fiber with a transmission of 74%. A conversion to 798nm, corresponding to a frequency separation of 2845cm-1 was realized. All components are fusion spliced and polarization maintaining to obtain alignment-free and robust operation.Ultrahigh spectral resolution of 1cm-1 was realized by a seeded FWM scheme (Fig. 1b). A laser scanning microscope was used to scan at Raman shifts of 2850cm-1 and 2930cm-1 mapping lipid and protein in a human aorta sample with artheriosclerotic plaque deposition (Fig. 1c). In conclusion, a novel approach for an all-fiber mono-laser source for CARS microscopy is presented. The frequency conversion is optimized to access a frequency shift of around 2850cm-1. Cw-seeding enhances the resolution greatly. Inherently synchronized pump and Stokes pulses are available at one fiber end, readily overlapped in space and time. The source is applied to CARS spectroscopy and microscopy experiments in the CH-stretching band. Due to its simplicity and maintenance-free operation, the laser scheme holds great potential for bio-medical applications outside laser laboratories.","","978-1-4799-0594-2","10.1109/CLEOE-IQEC.2013.6801343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6801343","","Optical fiber amplifiers;Optical fiber polarization;Microscopy;Frequency conversion;Laser applications;Fiber lasers;Chemical lasers","blood vessels;coherent antiStokes Raman scattering;integrated optics;laser applications in medicine;laser beams;laser mode locking;laser modes;medical disorders;multiwave mixing;optical fibre amplifiers;optical fibre polarisation;optical frequency conversion;optical microscopy;optical pumping;proteins;ytterbium","all-fiber laser source;CARS-microscopy;brain-cancer surgery;label-free chemical imaging;living tissue;real-world applications;CARS laser sources;Ti:Sapphire laser;bulk crystals;alignment-free laser source;passively mode-locked fiber oscillator;transform-limited pulses;fiber integrated amplification system;fiber optical parametric frequency conversion stage;degenerate four-wave-mixing;endless single-mode fiber;seeded FWM CARS source;cw seeding;CH2 resonances;CH3 resonances;long pulse durations;temporal walk-off;fiber delivery;mode-locked all-fiber oscillator;photo damage;peak power;Yb-doped single-clad fiber amplifier;active fiber;conversion fiber;frequency separation;fusion spliced fiber;polarization fiber;ultrahigh spectral resolution;laser scanning microscope;Raman shifts;lipid mapping;protein mapping;human aorta sample;artheriosclerotic plaque deposition;all-fiber monolaser source;frequency shift;synchronized pump pulses;Stokes pulses;CARS spectroscopy;CH-stretching band;maintenance-free operation;biomedical applications;laser laboratories;time 50 ps;frequency 2 MHz;power 0.5 W;wavelength 798 nm","","","","2","IEEE","21 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Remote sessions for joint interpretation have been carried out between pediatricians and clinical neurophysiologists, and EEG has been analyzed using frequency analyzing tools. One result is the discovery of reversible spectral changes coinciding with blood pressure falls, which may indicate loss of autoregulation function. This finding is one outcome from initial use of a system, developed during the project to facilitate communication about, and analysis of the recorded signals. Thus, already from a limited number of remote sessions and the use of basic signal processing techniques, important results have been achieved and better insight has been gained of how cerebral function is affected by cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.

These MR brain images are often corrupted with Intensity Inhomogeneity artifact cause unwanted intensity variation due to non- uniformity in RF coils and Rician noise, the dominant noise in MRI due to thermal vibrations of electrons and ions and movement of objects during acquisition which may affect the performance of image processing techniques used for brain image analysis. Due to this type of artifact and noises, sometimes one type of normal tissue in MRI may be misclassified as other type of normal tissue and it leads to error during diagnosis. In this work, a method is proposed which automatically segments normal tissues such as White Matter, Gray Matter and Cerebrospinal Fluid from MR images with Rician noise and Intensity Inhomogeneity artifact. The proposed method consists of preprocessing using wrapping based curvelet transform to remove noise and Modified Spatial Fuzzy C Means segments normal tissues by considering spatial information because neighboring pixels are highly correlated and also construct initial membership matrix using initial cluster center by incorporating spatial neighborhood information to improve strength of clustering. This combination reduces Intensity Inhomogeneity artifact by providing higher segmentation accuracy. In this proposed work, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are improved with better segmentation over other previous methods.","","978-1-4673-4862-1","10.1109/ICSIPR.2013.6497989","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6497989","Wrapping based Curvelet;Spatial Fuzzy C Means;Segmentation and Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Image segmentation;Accuracy;Magnetic resonance imaging;Wrapping;PSNR;Nonhomogeneous media","biological tissues;biomedical MRI;curvelet transforms;fuzzy set theory;image segmentation;medical image processing;pattern clustering","tissue segmentation;modified spatial fuzzy c means algorithm;MRI brain images;intensity inhomogeneity artifact;RF coils;Rician noise;electron thermal vibrations;ion thermal vibrations;object movement;image processing techniques;white matter;gray matter;cerebrospinal fluid;wrapping based curvelet transform;neighboring pixels;initial membership matrix;initial cluster center;spatial neighborhood information;clustering","","4","","15","IEEE","15 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cerebellar deep nuclei with its extensive projections to cortical regions could be a prospective target for stimulation to restore inter-hemispheric balance and enhance neural plasticity after stroke. In our study, we repeatedly stimulated the lateral cerebellar nucleus (LCN) by low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) for 3 days to enhance rehabilitation after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in a mouse stroke model. The neural activity of the mice sensorimotor cortex was measured using epidural electrodes and analyzed with quantified electroencephalography (qEEG). Pairwise derived Brain Symmetry Index (pdBSI) and delta power were used to assess the neurorehabilitative effect of LIFU stimulation. Compared to the Stroke (non-treated) group, the LIFU group exhibited a decrease in cortical pathological delta activity, significant recovery in pdBSI and enhanced performance on the balance beam walking test.

However, pathology still plays the most critical role in cancer diagnosis and prognosis in the clinic at present. Recent advancement of storing and processing histopathological images has drawn attention of researchers. Models based on histopathological images are developed, which show great potential for computer-aided pathological diagnoses. But models based on both molecular and histopathological images that could predict GBM prognosis with high accuracy are not present yet. In our previous research, we used the simple MKL method to integrate multi-omics data to improve GBM prognosis prediction successfully. In this paper, we have developed a novel multiple kernel learning (MKL) method, named histopathological integrating multiple kernel learning (HI-MKL), that could integrate both histopathological images and multi-omics data efficiently. By using datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas project, we have built a system that could predict the GBM prognosis with high accuracy.

The frequency-vs-depth map of LFP activity was extracted and further analyzed within different sub-bands, to investigate whether LFP activity can be used for STN border identification. STN borders identified by LFPs were compared to border predictions by the neurosurgeon, based on microelectrode-derived, single-unit recordings (MER-SUA). The results demonstrate difference between MER-SUA and macroelectrode LFP recording with respect to the dorsal STN border of -1.00 ±0.84 mm and -0.42 ±1.07 mm in the beta and gamma frequency bands, respectively. For these sub-bands, RMS of these distances was found to be 1.26 mm and 1.06 mm, respectively. Analysis of other sub-bands did not allow for distinguishing the caudal border of STN.

In this paper, Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) was used to analyze EEG slow wave activity during anesthesia in ten post-CA patients. The recordings were made in the intensive care unit 36-48 hours after the CA in an experiment, during which the propofol infusion rate was incrementally decreased to determine the drug-induced changes in the EEG at different anesthetic levels. HHT was shown to successfully capture the changes in the slow wave activity to the behavior of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). While, in patients with good neurological outcome defined after a six-month control period, propofol induced a significant increase in the amplitude of IMFs representing the slow wave activity, the patients with poor neurological outcome were unable to produce such a response. Consequently, the proposed method offer substantial prognostic potential by providing a novel approach for early estimation of HIE after CA.","1558-4615","978-1-4577-0220-4","10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7591080","","Electroencephalography;Anesthesia;Hospitals;Blood;Cardiac arrest;Brain injuries;Estimation","blood;brain;drugs;electroencephalography;haemodynamics;Hilbert transforms;injuries;medical signal processing;neurophysiology","Hilbert-Huang transform;EEG slow wave activity;anesthesia;post-cardiac arrest patients;hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy;cardiac arrest;substantial diagnostic challenge;brain injury;electroencephalogram;anesthetic drug propofol;HHT;post-CA patients;intensive care unit;propofol infusion rate;drug-induced changes;intrinsic mode functions;neurological outcome;IMFs amplitude;substantial prognostic potential;time 36 h to 48 h","Algorithms;Anesthesia;Electroencephalography;Heart Arrest;Humans;Propofol;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Treatment Outcome","2","","11","IEEE","18 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The stronger ratio of beta to gamma was found for a bipolar electrode pitch of 750 μm compared to 1000 μm, while a larger inter-electrode spacing of 1.5-3 mm with one contact in the GPe and the other in the GPi produced the strongest activity. Finally, oscillatory activity recorded within the same region of globus pallidus with a bipolar electrode montage oriented longitudinally versus radially did not differ significantly.

To tackle these problems, we propose a new combinatorial deep learning structure involving convolutional neural networks (inspired by the inception module), bidirectional long short-term memory, and an attention layer. The proposed model uses the EEG signal to continuously predicts the bispectral index (BIS). It is trained over a large dataset, mostly from those under general anesthesia with few cases receiving sedation/analgesia and spinal anesthesia. Despite the imbalance distribution of BIS values in different levels of anesthesia, our proposed structure achieves convincing root mean square error of 5.59 ± 1.04 and mean absolute error of 4.3 ± 0.87, as well as improvement in area under the curve of 15% on average, which surpasses state-of-the-art DOA estimation methods.

Owing to the individual difference in the sensory adaption of human smell function, the olfactory responses usually exhibit large inter-individual difference and change over time after repeated stimulations. The traditional analysis tools, such as statistical parametric mapping (SPM) in functional magnetic resonance imaging technique (fMRI) analysis, utilize the paradigm-based linear correlation and statistical techniques to discriminate the activation areas from background activities. However, these traditional approaches extract olfactory-induced responses using the stereotypic template or paradigm generated model. The olfactory-induced hemodynamic responses affected by internal/external events, such as changes of smell fatigue and attention, are not considered and therefore could result in misleading results. In this paper, owing to the stochastic characteristic of olfactory-induced responses, we adopted multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) to extract olfactory-induced hemodynamic responses in MRI blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signals. The MEMD is an efficient data-driven approach to extract nonlinear and non-stationary signals, which is an improved method to expand traditional empirical mode decomposition (EMD) from one channel to multi-channel processing. We applied MEMD to decompose time series of BOLD signals from each slice into multivariate intrinsic mode functions (IMF). The MEMD enables common features of different scales in an image slice to be arranged in distinct IMFs. Each IMF is an analytic, self-constructed, well-defined, and data-driven function with time-varying frequencies. Each IMF was examined by checking its correlation with the paradigm-generated template. The task-related IMFs were chosen to reconstruct olfactory-induced hemodynamic responses. The group analysis of MEMD-processed data showed olfactory-induced activations in the anterior cingulate cortex and middle frontal gyrus.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2893923","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan(grant numbers:107-2634-F-008-003,107-2911-I-008-502,106-2221-E-008-001-MY3,106 -2911-I-008-503,106-2221-E-008-001-MY3,106-2221-E-008-003-MY3,105-2511-S-008-002-MY3); Taipei Medical University(grant numbers:TMU102-AE1-B09); NCU-Landseed Hospital Project(grant numbers:NCU-LSH-104-B-008); Taoyuan Hospital Intramural Project, Wan-Fan Hospital Intramural Project(grant numbers:106-WF-EVA-05); Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology(grant numbers:NCSIST-AGV-V102 (107)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8620252","Multivariate empirical mode decomposition;olfactory;functional magnetic resonance imaging","Olfactory;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Task analysis;Hemodynamics;Diseases;Brain","biomedical MRI;blood;brain;chemioception;data analysis;diseases;haemodynamics;Hilbert transforms;medical image processing;neurophysiology;time series","multivariate intrinsic mode functions;data-driven function;olfactory-induced hemodynamic responses;olfactory-induced activations;multivariate empirical mode decomposition-based data-driven approach;olfactory-induced fMRI;olfactory dysfunction;clinical neurodegenerative diseases;olfactory responses;inter-individual difference;functional magnetic resonance imaging technique analysis;olfactory-induced responses;MRI blood-oxygen-level dependent signals;traditional empirical mode decomposition;nonlinear signals;nonstationary signals","","4","","63","OAPA","20 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It ends with a summary of key clinical trials that lead to consensus studies. The practical utility of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) as stimulated by administration of δ-aminolevulinic acid has had substantial pilot clinical studies and basic science research completed. Recently, multicenter clinical trials using PpIX fluorescence to guide resection have shown efficacy for improved short-term survival. Exogenous agents are being developed and tested preclinically, and hopefully hold the potential for long-term survival benefit if they provide additional capabilities for resection of microinvasive disease or certain tumor subtypes that do not produce PpIX or help delineate low-grade tumors. The range of technologies used for measurement and imaging varies widely, with most clinical trials being carried out with either point probes or modified surgical microscopes. Currently, optimized probe approaches are showing efficacy in clinical trials, and fully commercialized imaging systems are emerging, which will clearly help to lead adoption into neurosurgical practice.","1558-4542","","10.1109/JSTQE.2009.2034541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5437303","Brain tumor;fluorescence;glioma;imaging;microscopy;neurosurgery;protoporphyrin;surgery","Neurosurgery;Fluorescence;Clinical trials;Neoplasms;Probes;Biomarkers;Testing;Diseases;Surgery;Microscopy","biochemistry;biomedical optical imaging;diseases;enzymes;fluorescence;molecular biophysics;nanobiotechnology;nanoparticles;neurophysiology;quantum dots;surgery;tumours","neurosurgical fluorescence imaging methodologies;biomarkers;biochemical agents;endogenous fluorescence;exogenously stimulated fluorescence;exogenous contrast agents;protoporphyrin IX;δ-aminolevulinic acid;multicenter clinical trials;PpIX fluorescence;resection;microinvasive disease;tumor subtypes;low-grade tumors;optimized probe approaches;nanoparticles;quantum dots;enzyme function targeting;peptide targeting","","90","1","137","IEEE","22 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, due to the geometry and the heterogeneous medium of the human skull, the currently used hemispherical transducers cannot guarantee that the ultrasound emitted by the transducer penetrates the skull normally; consequently, the impact of the shear wave on the treatment area has to be considered. The usual approach is to turn off elements in the transducer with excessively large incident angles, but this approach reduces the efficiency of the transducer. This article presents the design of a novel transducer that can be rotated according to the different geometric shapes of the skull. The incident angles of the elements in the transducer are modified so that the effect of the shear wave on the treatment area can be ignored and the efficiency of the transducer is improved. The results of computed tomography (CT) model simulation of nine skulls verify the versatility and feasibility of the new transducer.

Results: This completely non-contact surgical system is capable of resecting the tumor boundary of a tissue phantom with an average root mean square error (RMSE) of approximately 1.55 mm and an average max error of approximately 2.15 mm. There is no difference in the performance of the system when changing the size of the internal tumor from 7.5-12.5 mm in diameter. Discussion: Future research steps include creating a more intelligent spectral search strategy to increase the density of points around the resection boundary, and to develop a more sophisticated classifier to predict pathologic diagnosis and tissue subtypes located regionally around the tumor boundaries.

In this paper, we report a fully unsupervised and automated approach to seizure focus localization using a Bayesian filter. This method uses a spectral domain feature, Power in Bands (PIB). PIB is extracted from inter-ictal (non-seizure) intracranial EEG recordings of patients with focal epilepsy to differentiate normal and abnormal brain regions. This study was carried out using data collected from 34 patients with focal epilepsy at the Mayo Clinic. Experiments show that using a Bayesian filter for capturing temporal properties of the iEEGs recorded from epileptic brains remarkably improves localization accuracy (AUC: 0.63 → 0.72). Our study also reaffirms that high-frequency oscillations and inter-ictal spikes are useful inter-ictal biomarkers of the epileptic brain, and PIB, which could be implemented with relatively low computational burden, performs as well as the standard bio-markers when used in this setting.We conclude that the technique of extracting spectral features from inter-ictal iEEGs and capturing their temporal properties via a Bayesian filter markedly improves our ability to localize seizure onset zones.","1948-3554","978-1-5090-4603-4","10.1109/NER.2017.8008407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8008407","","Feature extraction;Epilepsy;Bayes methods;Surgery;Hafnium oxide;Oscillators;Transient analysis","electroencephalography;feature extraction;medical disorders;medical signal processing;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","interictal seizure onset zone localization;unsupervised clustering;Bayesian filtering;surgical removal;brain tissue;seizure focus localization;spectral domain feature;Power in Bands;feature extraction;interictal intracranial EEG recordings;brain regions;focal epilepsy;iEEGs;epileptic brains","","3","2","23","IEEE","14 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They need constant monitoring for epileptic seizures. Better treatment can be provided by the doctors or precautionary measures can be taken by the patients themselves if any abnormal brain activity or seizure is predicted before its occurrence. The pre-ictal period has some information about the occurrence of epileptic seizure in EEG signals. The brain behaves normal in inter-ictal and postictal periods. For epilepsy, long duration EEG recording are required from days to week. This keeps the patients to stay in the hospital for many days. Our proposed methodology is to predict the epileptic seizure and monitor the brain abnormality in real time. Still there is no epileptic seizure prediction algorithm using EEG available for clinical applications. Our aim is to study and develop a good epileptic seizure prediction algorithm/method with high value of sensitivity and specificity using scalp EEG i-e noninvasive approach.

The results of experiments in tissue-like phantoms and ex vivo rat brains suggest that the synchronous scan effectively examines the fluorescence peaks of multiple fluorophores in one single scan, reduce the overlap between fluorescence peaks of different endogenous fluorophores, and express/suppress the effect of specific absorption peaks on the shapes of fluorescence spectra.

As part of strides towards investigating this problem, this work involved using EEG brain waves acquired from the frontal cortex region during surgery to predict DoA. Specifically, we employed a signal decomposition pre-processing technique, followed by a feature selection process to obtain an optimal feature set used for modelling linear and nonlinear regression-based algorithms for prediction tasks.

Here we propose a method for predicting the result of a resection from data collected before the eventual resection, therefore allowing an optimal surgical planning. Our major hypothesis is that focal generalized epilepsies are caused by sub-systems with excessive afferent connectivity to and from the rest of the neuronal tissue. To address the issue of delineating the EZ before the actual resection, we propose a paradigm performing ""virtual surgery"" on the matrix of connectivity between local EEG measurements. The virtual resection removes not only the nodes covered by the suspected EZ and their connections but also subtracts the influence of these nodes on the rest of connectivity. The residual connectivity is then compared to the original one and a significant decrease indicate that the resection contains the EZ or at least large part of it. We tested this approach on a computational model of spatially distributed bi-stable units that provides a generic model of focal epileptic neuronal system. In the modelled cases of epileptic system with spreading seizures, we found that the removal of the EZ can be predicted by significant decrease of the residual connectivity after performing virtual resection. This decrease commensurate with the increase of the epileptic threshold (the ground truth) . The method also predicts the actual change of connectivity after removing the nodes from the model dynamics. In addition we tested our techniques against the ""naïve"" virtual resection which is based on simply removing the corresponding nodes from the connectivity measure. The findings in this work can be exploited to increase the efficiency and accuracy of pre-surgical epileptogenic zone localization in cases of focal epileptic seizure onsets.","","978-1-7281-9468-4","10.1109/CIBCB48159.2020.9277710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9277710","Epilepsy;Surgery;Computational Models;Connectivity","Mathematical model;Epilepsy;Brain modeling;Surgery;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Predictive models","electroencephalography;medical disorders;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;surgery","epilepsy surgery outcome;patient seizure-free;surgical planning;focal generalized epilepsies;neuronal tissue;virtual surgery;generic model;focal epileptic neuronal system;epileptic system;naïve virtual resection;presurgical epileptogenic zone localization;local EEG measurements","","","","22","IEEE","7 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One way to improve the patient survival is to identify and excise the glioma tumor precisely and completely to seek for subsequent treatment. Due to the system complexity and limited performances of the existing diagnostic tools, however, the identification of glioma tumor is difficult, and therefore, it is imperative to develop new diagnostic imaging tools that could be able to identify glioma rapidly and reliably. In this study, we construct a free-spaced micro-optical coherence tomography (μOCT) system, which achieves a spatial resolution of ~ 2.0 μm, for glioma imaging, and then, evaluate its capability for identifying the cellular/sub-cellular structures of glioma lesions. Imaging results demonstrate that the μOCT system is not only able to acquire cellular/sub-cellular glioma microstructure images, but it is also able to differentiate between the low-grade and high-grade glioma lesions with the three-dimensional (3D) tissue morphology appearances. The low system complexity enables μOCT to be integrated onto surgical pick tip and utilized as an intraoperative diagnostic tool, while the high-resolution imaging capability of μOCT could help neurosurgeons identify the interfaces between glioma lesions and non-cancerous tissues fast and reliably, and thus, help neurosurgeons make appropriate treatment decisions. Such results convincingly demonstrate the potential of μOCT for neurosurgery in clinical practice.","1558-2809","978-1-7281-3868-8","10.1109/IST48021.2019.9010090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9010090","Micro-OCT;microstructure imaging;central nervous system;glioma lesions;intraoperative diagnosis","Imaging;Tumors;Spatial resolution;Tools;Measurement by laser beam;Lenses","biomedical optical imaging;brain;cancer;medical image processing;micro-optics;optical tomography;surgery;tumours","glioma tumor;microoptical coherence tomography system;μOCT system;high-grade glioma lesions;three-dimensional tissue morphology;high-speed three-dimensional glioma morphology imaging;grade discrimination;central nervous system tumor;low-grade glioma lesions;cellular-subcellular structures;neurosurgery","","","","29","IEEE","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this method may lead to side effects of overheating tissues and skull bones located over the beam path. To mitigate these effects, we propose an alternative approach termed boiling histotripsy (BH). The approach utilizes short ultrasound bursts with shocks of amplitude greater than 60 MPa and can induce mechanical destruction of tissue practically without thermal effects. In this study we developed a mathematical model of a multi-element phased array that could enable reaching BH conditions in deep brain structures taking into account the effects of aberrations, reflections, absorption, nonlinearity, shear waves in the skull, and existing technical limitations for the intensity at the array elements (40 W/cm2). A model of 256-element 1 MHz array was proposed using the method of creating a fully populated random pattern at the array surface comprising equal area polygonal elements. Three numerical algorithms that combine three different physical models (the Rayleigh integral method, a linear k-space Kelvin-Voigt model, and nonlinear Westervelt model) were used to simulate a 3D ultrasound beam when focusing through the skin, skull, and brain tissues. These algorithms allow simulation of linear and nonlinear beam focusing through the skull as well as correction of aberrations induced by skull bones and inhomogeneity of the head. To perform simulations, a 3D acoustic model of the head was created using segmentation of MRI data taken from an open database. The results of simulations have shown that the proposed array can provide nonlinear waveforms at the focus with shock amplitudes sufficient for BH exposures after aberration correction.","1948-5727","978-1-5386-3425-7","10.1109/ULTSYM.2018.8579790","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8579790","high-intensity focused ultrasound;HIFU;fully populated array;transcranial ultrasound surgery;boiling histotripsy;multi-element array","Manganese","aberrations;biomedical MRI;biomedical ultrasonics;biothermics;bone;brain;medical image processing;shock wave effects;ultrasonic therapy","fully populated phased array;transcranial HIFU therapies;shock-wave exposures;aberration correction;ultrasound hemispherical arrays;thermal lesions;intact skull;skull bones;beam path;short ultrasound bursts;deep brain structures;shear waves;fully populated random pattern;equal area polygonal elements;numerical algorithms;Rayleigh integral method;linear k-space Kelvin-Voigt model;nonlinear Westervelt model;3D ultrasound beam;brain tissues;3D acoustic model;nonlinear waveforms;shock amplitudes;MRI data;high-intensity focused ultrasound hemispherical arrays;multi-element phased array;nonlinear beam focusing;skull tissues;skin tissues;boiling histotripsy exposures;physical models;frequency 1.0 MHz","","","","16","IEEE","20 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Failing to allocate attention and neural resources to estimate these values can be costly, and in some cases can lead to bankruptcy. Alpha-band (8-12 Hz) oscillatory power in the brain is thought to reflect attention, but how this influences financial decision making is not well understood. Using local field potential recordings in nine human subjects performing a gambling task, we compared alpha-band power from the cingulate cortex (CC) during trials of low and high attention.

Therefore, a number of useful operation video records are stored in the hospitals. It is considered that these video records contain significant information, so it is needed to utilize these video data. In awake craniotomy, which is one of the advanced neurological surgery, surgeon performs direct electrical stimulation to patient's brain area during linguistic tasks(such as, naming objects or generating verbs) in order to detect brain functional areas. The electrical stimulation of the cortical speech area causes temporary speech arrest. Hence, video segments which speech arrest is caused are significant in terms of surgical video analysis. The electrical stimulation timings are obtained from sound information, however that segments are not tagged speech arrest or not. In this paper, we report on the performance of a classification method for classifying patient's response for linguistic tasks just after electrical stimulation. In order to extract patient's speech features, we used melfrequency cepstrum coefficient(MFCC) and its delta parameters which are often used in speech recognition. We used Relevance Vector Machine(RVM) and Support Vector Machine(SVM) for classification and compared their results. We applied RVM and SVM for extracted patient's speech features and evaluated in F-measure. The classifier achieves in classification rates about 80[%] in 10-fold cross validation.

The current gold standard for focus localization is from ictal (seizure) onset and thus requires the occurrence and recording of multiple typical seizures of a patient. Localization of the focus from seizure-free (interictal) periods remains a challenging problem, especially in the absence of interictal epileptiform activity. Methods: By exploring the concept of effective inflow, we developed a focus localization algorithm (FLA) based on directed connectivity between brain sites. Subsequently, using the measure of generalized partial directed coherence over a broad frequency band in FLA for the analysis of interictal periods from long-term (days) intracranial electroencephalographic signals, we identified the brain region that is the most frequent receiver of maximal effective inflow from other brain regions. Results: In six out of nine patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, the thus identified brain region was a statistically significant outlier (p <; 0.01) and coincided with the clinically assessed epileptogenic focus. In the remaining three patients, the clinically assessed focus still exhibited the highest inflow, but it was not deemed an outlier (p > 0.01). Conclusions: These findings suggest that the epileptogenic focus is a region of intense influence from other regions interictally, possibly as a mechanism to keep it under control in seizure-free periods. Significance: The developed framework is expected to assist with the accurate epileptogenic focus localization, reduce hospital stay and healthcare cost, and provide guidance to treatment of epilepsy via resective surgery or neuromodulation.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2016.2633200","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-1102390); Department of Defense(grant numbers:PT090712); iEEG; NIH(grant numbers:NS039687); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7762148","Epilepsy;epileptogenic focus localization;frequency-based connectivity analysis;generalized partial directed coherence (GPDC)","Epilepsy;Electroencephalography;Coherence;Couplings;Frequency-domain analysis","electroencephalography;medical disorders;medical signal processing","interictal localization;epileptogenic focus;iEEG;seizure onset;seizure-free;interictal periods;interictal epileptiform activity;focus localization algorithm;brain sites;intracranial electroencephalographic signals;brain region;maximal effective inflow;temporal lobe epilepsy;resective surgery;neuromodulation","Algorithms;Brain;Brain Mapping;Connectome;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electrocorticography;Epilepsy;Female;Humans;Male;Nerve Net;Neural Pathways;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","23","","62","IEEE","29 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This has been a difficult challenge and today no IR fiber has optical and mechanical properties even close to that of silica fiber. Nevertheless, the need for an IR fiber for medical CO/sub 2/ and Er:YAG lasers requires medical laser companies and clinicians to adopt often less than ideal IR fiber technologies. In this paper, the authors review the state-of-the-art in IR fibers for laser power delivery at 3 and 10.6 /spl mu/m. The best power delivery fibers for the CO/sub 2/ laser are hollow waveguides. Hollow sapphire fibers are currently used in gynecological, orthopedic, and neurosurgical applications. The authors have used the hollow sapphire in their neurosurgical studies on brain tissue to deliver over 25 W of CO/sup 2/ laser power to tissue. There are several fibers of choice for the Er:YAG laser. One type is the heavy-metal fluoride glass fiber and the other is solid sapphire fiber. Sapphire fibers are fabricated using either a laser-heated-pedesta1 growth (LHPG) or edge-defined, film fed growth (EFG) technique. The former has produced the lowest loss fiber to date but the EFG process developed by Saphikon Inc. has promise of producing low-loss fiber in long lengths. The best LHPG sapphire fiber has a loss less than 1 dB/m and may be made in diameters from 100 to 400 /spl mu/m. In power tests in their lab, the authors have delivered over 600 mJ of Er:YAG laser energy through a 50-cm long LHPG sapphire fiber. We have also used this fiber in some ophthalmic studies to study the ablation of tissue in eye-bank eyes. In general, we have found that the fiber functions well in a wet field and that we can ablate tissue using over 100 mJ without damage to the fiber end.<>","","0-7803-1263-5","10.1109/LEOS.1993.379058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=379058","","Optical fibers;Fiber lasers;Power lasers;Optical fiber testing;Waveguide lasers;Neurosurgery;Laser surgery;Biomedical optical imaging;Optical films;Mechanical factors","laser applications in medicine;surgery;optical fibres","laser surgery;fiber optics;IR fibers;laser power delivery;laser surgical procedures;Er:YAG lasers;medical CO/sub 2/ lasers;hollow waveguides;hollow sapphire fibers;neurosurgical applications;orthopedic applications;gynecological applications;heavy-metal fluoride glass fiber;solid sapphire fiber;laser-heated-pedesta1 growth;edge-defined, film fed growth;lowest loss fiber;ophthalmic studies;tissue ablation;25 W;2.94 micron;1 dB;100 to 400 micron;600 mJ;50 cm;100 mJ;3 micron;10.6 micron;YAG:Nd;CO/sub 2/;YAl5O12:Nd","","","","2","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here, three PD patients implanted with a therapeutic deep brain neural stimulator that can also record and wirelessly stream neural data played a neurofeedback game where they modulated their beta band power from sensorimotor cortical areas. Patients' beta band power was streamed in real-time to update the position of a cursor that they tried to drive into a cued target.

IIS and HFO have become recognized as reliable biomarkers in identification of the epileptic focus in the cortex of epileptic patients. While IIS, commonly referred to as spikes, have classically been used for the diagnosis of epilepsy and for source localization techniques, ripples have been associated with more generalized cortex regions of interest and surrogate biomarkers for the seizure onset zone (SOZ). This research aims to combine these two analyses by correlating HFO and IIS events in the time domain for each electrode recording with the goal of yielding a more complete understanding of the abnormal electrical activity of the cortex in epileptic patients.

Complexity was assessed via a local nonlinear prediction approach exploiting the k-nearest neighbor strategy. The presence of nonlinear dynamics was checked by comparing the complexity marker computed over the original series with the distribution of values assessed over 100 surrogates preserving distribution and power spectral density of the original series but with random phases. We found that: i) HP variance was significantly reduced in POST; ii) the complexity of SAP and DAP variabilities increased in POST with a greater likelihood of observing nonlinear dynamics over SAP compared to PRE at supine rest; iii) the amplitude of MCBF fluctuations and its complexity in POST remained similar to PRE.

Cognitive function was evaluated via psychological tests at every time point, while the presence of ischemic lesions was evaluated at POST via diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI). Findings showed that CV control indexes were affected in POST and recovered at POST3. DW-MRI indicated the presence of recent ischemic lesions in a high percentage of patients but their cognitive function as well as CBV control was preserved at all time points.

External or endoscopic ultrasound technologies are often not effective for imaging deep inside organs due to lack of adequate spatial resolution. In this paper, we propose using a miniature, low power implantable ultrasound imager for online monitoring of tumor growth in internal body parts. We explore the design space for such an implantable ultrasonic imaging system targeted to early detection or post-surgery monitoring of a malignant growth.

In this paper, four categories of HFOs are considered: Gamma ([30-80 Hz]), high-gamma ([80-120 Hz]), ripples ([120-250 Hz]), and fast-ripples ([250-600 Hz]). A universal detector of the four types of HFOs is proposed. It has the advantages of 1) classifying HFOs, and thus, being robust to inter and intrasubject variability; 2) rejecting artefacts, thus being specific. Methods : Gabor atoms are tuned to cover the physiological bands. Gabor transform is then used to detect HFOs in intracerebral electroencephalography (iEEG) signals recorded in patients candidate to epilepsy surgery. To extract relevant features, energy ratios, along with event duration, are investigated. Discriminant ratios are optimized so as to maximize among the four types of HFOs and artefacts. A multiclass support vector machine (SVM) is used to classify detected events. Pseudoreal signals are simulated to measure the performance of the method when the ground truth is known. Results: Experiments are conducted on simulated and on human iEEG signals. The proposed method shows high performance in terms of sensitivity and false discovery rate. Conclusion: The methods have the advantages of detecting and discriminating all types of HFOs as well as avoiding false detections caused by artefacts.

It is known that the amplitude and the location of the lobes depend on both the geometry and the frequency of the transducer. A new procedure based on the use of a wide-band CW signal, i.e., a signal phase modulated by a pseudorandom code, is proposed to reduce the amplitude of these lobes. The theoretical study enables us to determine the location and the amplitude of these lobes and to simulate the effect of the transmitted signal bandwidth. In particular, a simple analytical relation gives the intensity ratio between the grating lobes and the main lobe. This equation shows that this ratio is inversely proportional to the number of rings and to the bandwidth of the transmitted signal.

Source localization analyses were applied using multiple algorithms, both at the beginning of ictal onset and for interictal MEG discharges. Ictal MEG onsets were identified by visual inspection and power spectrum using short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Source localizations were compared with ICEEG, surgical procedure and outcome. Eight patients were included in this study. Five of the 8 patients (63%) had concordant ictal MEG onset source localization and interictal MEG discharge source localizations in the same lobe, but the source of ictal MEG onset was closer to the SOZ defined by ICEEG.

In this contribution, we procured the focal and non focal EEG signals recorded from the temporal lobe epileptic patients and decomposed the recorded EEG data into several brain rhythms to obtain their time variation of different neural oscillations. Then, we selected a random EEG signal from each rhythm as a reference and performed cross wavelet transform (XWT) of the rest of the EEG rhythms with their respective chosen reference rhythms to examine their nature of correlation in both time scale and time-frequency frame. Finally, the obtained cross-rhythm spectrum time-frequency image plots were fed to a customized CNN model for the purpose of automated feature extraction and classification of EEG signals. The performance of the proposed CNN model was also compared with two pre-trained benchmark CNN models namely AlexNet and VGGNet16, respectively. We observed that the proposed EEG signal classification framework has delivered 100% accuracy for the delta ( $\delta$ ) rhythm and that too at a significantly reduced training time compared to the existing state-of-the-art CNN models. Interestingly, the detection accuracy was also found to be the highest for a particular EEG rhythm, which can be proven useful in real time analysis for accurate diagnosis of focal epilepsy.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2021.3111102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9535119","Electroencephalogram;epilepsy;wavelet transform;classification;convolutional neural network","Electroencephalography;Rhythm;Convolutional neural networks;Epilepsy;Transforms;Brain modeling;Wavelet transforms","convolutional neural nets;electroencephalography;feature extraction;medical disorders;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;signal classification;wavelet transforms","neural oscillations;random EEG signal;EEG rhythms;time-frequency frame;cross-rhythm spectrum time-frequency image plots;automated feature extraction;EEG signals;EEG signal classification framework;delta rhythm;focal epilepsy;focal epileptic area recognition;convolutional neural network;focal seizure area;human brain;automated detection;focal electroencephalography signals;temporal lobe epileptic patients;recorded EEG data;brain rhythms;CNN models","","6","","33","IEEE","10 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Signs of autonomic activity are not very accurate; hence, an alternative technique is required to monitor the depth of anaesthesia. In common with many biological systems, brain activity is a dynamical system having irregular and unpredictable characteristics. The mathematical analysis of the behaviour of dynamical systems has expanded rapidly with the advent of fast computers. This has given rise to a wide range of medical applications, including mathematical analysis of the human EEG. It is in this last genre that the automatic assessment of the depth of anaesthesia, using ongoing EEG as a measure of brain activity, is discussed. One of the most important problems in EEG analysis is the extraction of appropriate features to describe the ongoing signal, and this can be tackled in various ways. The feature extraction stage of the work described in this paper was performed using methods of dynamic systems analysis and involved the extraction of stochastic and dynamic complexity features of the signal. Feature-spaces formed using these two methods were used as input to a radial basis function pattern classifier. We show that, despite the agent specificity of EEG changes in anaesthesia, a useful anaesthetic depth monitor may be created.

While Micro-electrode Recording (MER) provides adjunctive information to guidance assisted by pre-operative imaging, it is not unanimously used in the operating room. The lack of standard use of MER may be in part due to its long duration, which can lead to complications during the operation, or due to high degree of expertise required for their interpretation. Over the past decade, various approaches addressing automating MER analysis for target localization have been proposed, which have mainly focused on feature engineering. While the accuracies obtained are acceptable in certain configurations, one issue with handcrafted MER features is that they do not necessarily capture more subtle differences in MER that could be detected auditorily by an expert neurophysiologist. In this paper, we propose and validate a deep learning-based pipeline for subthalamic nucleus (STN) localization with micro-electrode recordings motivated by the human auditory system.

Whereas invasive solutions that offer higher signal quality in contrast are suffocated in their spreading because of the potential surgical complication and health risks caused by electrode implantation. Therefore, it puts forward a necessity to explore a scheme that could both collect high-quality EEG signals and guarantee high-level operation safety.This study proposed a Minimally Invasive Local-skull Electrophysiological Modification method to improve scalp EEG signals qualities at specific brain regions. Six eight-month-old SD rats were used for in vivo verification experiment. A hole with a diameter of about 500 micrometers was drilled in the skull above the visual cortex of rats. Significant changes in rsEEG and SSVEP signals before and after modification were observed. After modification, the skull impedance of rats decreases by about 84 %, the average maximum bandwidth of rsEEG increase by 57 %, and the broadband SNR of SSVEP is increased by 5.13 dB. The time of piezoelectric drilling operation is strictly controlled under 30 seconds for each rat to prevent possible brain damage from overheating. Compared with traditional invasive procedures such as ECoG, Minimally Invasive Local-skull Electrophysiological Modification operation time is shorter and no electrode implantation is needed while it remarkably boosts the scalp EEG signal quality. This technical solution has the potential to replace the use of ECoG in certain application scenarios and further invigorate studies in the field of scalp EEG in the future.","1558-0210","","10.1109/TNSRE.2022.3192543","Key Research and Development Program of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region(grant numbers:2022CMG02026); Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2018B030339001); Beijing Science and Technology Plan(grant numbers:Z201100004420015); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9833539","Brain-computer interface;skull modification;minimally invasive;SSVEP;EEG","Electroencephalography;Rats;Scalp;Visualization;Frequency measurement;Electrodes;Skull","biomedical electrodes;brain-computer interfaces;medical disorders;neurophysiology;surgery;visual evoked potentials","minimally invasive local-skull electrophysiological modification operation time;scalp EEG signal quality;piezoelectric drilling operation;skull impedance;specific brain regions;scalp EEG signals qualities;Minimally Invasive Local-skull Electrophysiological Modification method;high-level operation safety;high-quality EEG signals;electrode implantation;health risks;potential surgical complication;humble quality;noninvasive BCI;piezoelectric drill","Animals;Electrocorticography;Electroencephalography;Electrophysiological Phenomena;Rats;Rats, Sprague-Dawley;Skull","","","47","CCBY","20 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For detection, we used a signal envelope modeling technique which adaptively identifies statistical parameters of signals containing spikes. Application of this technique to human intracranial EEG data demonstrated that it was superior to expert labeling and it was able to detect even small amplitude interictal epileptiform discharges. In the second task, detected spikes were clustered by principal component analysis according to their spatial distribution.

Performance is assessed with test parameters including: measurement noise, electrode placement errors, contact impedance errors, deviations in assumed tissue conductivity, deviations in assumed anatomy, and a frequency-dependent background. A final test is performed using ischemic patient data. Results are assessed using images and quantitative metrics. Results: BFSD-EIT may be feasible for stroke diagnosis if a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of ≥60 dB is achievable. Sensitivity to errors in electrode positioning is seen with a tolerance of only ±5 mm, but a tolerance of up to ±30 mm is possible if symmetry is maintained between symmetrically opposite partner electrodes. The technique is robust to errors in contact impedance and assumed tissue conductivity up to at least ±50%. Asymmetric internal anatomy affects performance but may be tolerable for tissues with frequency-dependent conductivity. Errors in assumed external geometry marginally affect performance. A frequency-dependent background does not affect performance with carefully chosen frequency points or use of multiple frequency points across a band. The Global Left-Hand Side (LHS) & Right-Hand Side (RHS) Mean Intensity metric is particularly robust to errors. Conclusion: BFSD-EIT is a promising technique for stroke diagnosis, provided parameters are within the tolerated ranges. Significance: BFSD-EIT may prove an important step forward in imaging of static scenes such as stroke.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2019.2960862","European Research Council(grant numbers:BioElecPro 637780); Science Foundation Ireland(grant numbers:15/ERCS/3276); Hardiman Research Scholarship from NUIG; Charity RESPECT; Seventh Framework Programme(grant numbers:PCOFUND-GA-2013-608728); NIHR Imperial Biomedical Research Centre; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8936983","Electrical impedance tomography;reconstruction algorithm;stroke imaging","Tomography;Electrodes;Numerical models;Conductivity;Head;Brain modeling;Finite element analysis","bioelectric phenomena;biological tissues;biomedical electrodes;electric impedance imaging;finite element analysis;medical image processing;physiological models","BFSD-EIT;stroke diagnosis;symmetrically opposite partner electrodes;assumed tissue conductivity;frequency-dependent conductivity;assumed external geometry;frequency-dependent background;multiple frequency points;electrode placement errors;contact impedance errors;assumed anatomy;4-layer finite element method head model;bi-frequency symmetry difference-EIT;signal-to-noise ratio;unilateral perturbations;symmetric scenes;FEM;SNR;measurement noise;global left-hand side mean intensity metric;LHS;right-hand side mean intensity metric;RHS;ischemic patient data","Algorithms;Electric Conductivity;Electric Impedance;Feasibility Studies;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Stroke;Tomography","8","","45","IEEE","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Localization is also essential in biomedical applications such as detecting cancerous tissues, drug delivery, brain mapping, and robotic surgeries. Current localization systems are either battery-powered or require large coils for wireless power transfer, making them bulky and unfit for use in wearable or implantable applications. This paper proposes a fully battery-less localization system using wireless energy harvesting. Additionally, the system can be used for the detection of the rate of periodic physiological motions such as diaphragm motion during breathing. The proposed localization system uses ISM bands and transmits a locked sub-harmonic 13.56 MHz signal generated from the received 40.68 MHz radio frequency (RF) signal, eliminating the need for a power-hungry oscillator. The localizer has a small form factor of 17 mm × 12 mm × 0.2 mm and consumes an average power of 6 μW. Ex vivo measurements using the localizer inside the porcine intestine demonstrate a localization accuracy of less than 1 cm.","2163-4025","978-1-6654-6917-3","10.1109/BioCAS54905.2022.9948647","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9948647","Localization;wireless;battery-less;energy harvesting;motion detection;biomedical;capsule endoscope","Location awareness;Wireless communication;Coils;Wireless sensor networks;Endoscopes;Surgery;Wireless power transfer","biological organs;biological tissues;biomedical optical imaging;diseases;endoscopes;energy harvesting;pneumodynamics","40.68 MHz radio frequency signal;brain mapping;breathing;cancerous tissues;diaphragm motion;drug delivery;ex vivo measurements;form factor;frequency 13.56 MHz;frequency 40.68 MHz;fully battery-less localization system;gastrointestinal tract disease treatment;implantable applications;ISM bands;localization accuracy;localizer;locked sub-harmonic 13.56 MHz signal;periodic physiological motions;physiological motion detection system;point-of-care biomedical applications;porcine intestine;power 6.0 muW;robotic surgeries;wearable applications;wireless capsule endoscopes;wireless energy harvesting;wireless localization;wireless power transfer","","","","14","IEEE","16 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Identification of focal EEG signals locates the epileptogenic area, which is an important task for successful surgery. In this article, a convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based framework is proposed for automatic identification of focal EEG signals. The proposed intelligent system initially uses a window for randomly segment the input EEG signals. The short-time Fourier transform is applied on to the segmented EEG signals for conversion of input EEG signals into time-frequency (T-F) representation. The T-F representation of EEG signals is used as T-F images. Instead of training an end-to-end CNNs which necessitates more input images and time, we opt to use a pretrained CNNs model for transfer learning. Specifically, deep feature extraction (DFE) is employed for acquiring the more convenient features from the input EEG images. The deep features extracted from AlexNet, VGG16, VGG19, and Resnet50 models are used as input to different variants of the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier. The conducted experimental works show that AlexNet, VGG16, and Resnet50 achieve promising results. Specifically, the fc6 layers of AlexNet, VGG16, and fc1000 layer of Resnet50 produce a 99.8% accuracy score with the weighted-k-NN approach. The comparative study shows that the proposed method provides better performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2019.2909119","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8681134","Sensor signal processing;convolutional neural networks (CNNs);electroencephalogram (EEG) signal;k-nearest neighbor (k-NN);transfer learning","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Feature extraction;Mathematical model;Entropy;Convolution;Time-frequency analysis","convolutional neural nets;electroencephalography;feature extraction;Fourier transforms;medical signal processing;nearest neighbour methods;signal classification;surgery","focal EEG signals;electroencephalogram signals;epileptogenic area;convolutional neural networks based framework;automatic identification;input EEG signals;short-time Fourier transform;segmented EEG signals;end-to-end CNNs;input images;pretrained CNNs model;deep feature extraction;VGG16;VGG19;weighted-k-NN approach;k-nearest neighbor classifier;intelligent system","","10","","21","IEEE","3 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, by measuring the complexity information of cerebral hemodynamic variables, the sample entropy was calculated as a new index of monitoring the depth of anesthesia. Results: By means of receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the sample entropy approach was proved to effectively discriminate anesthesia maintenance and waking phases.

This promising treatment modality requires high energy resulting eventually in undesired cavitation and potential side effects. The goals of the present work were: 1) to evaluate the potential increase of the cavitation threshold using pseudorandom gated sonications and 2) to assess the heating capabilities with such sonications. The experiments were performed with the transcranial magnetic resonance (MR)-compatible ExAblate Neuro system (InSightec, Haifa, Israel) operating at a frequency of 670 kHz, either in continuous wave (CW) or with pseudorandom gated sonications of 50% duty cycle. Cavitation activity with the two types of sonications was compared using chemical dosimetry of hydroxyl radical production at the focus of the transducer, after propagation in water or through a human skull. Heating trials were performed in a hydrogel tissue-mimicking material embedded in a human skull to mimic a clinical situation. The temperature was measured by MR-thermometry when focusing at the geometrical focus and steering off focus up to 15 mm. Compared with CW sonications, the use of gated sonication did not affect the efficiency (60%) nor the steering abilities of the transducer. After propagation through a human skull, gated sonication required a higher pressure level (10 MPa) to initiate cavitation as compared with CW (5.8 MPa). Moreover, at equivalent acoustic power above the cavitation threshold, the level of cavitation activity initiated with gated sonications was much lower with gated sonication than with continuous sonications, almost half after propagation through water and one-third after propagation through a skull. This lowered cavitation activity may be attributed to a breaking of the dynamic of the bubbles moving from monochromatic to more broadband sonications and to the removal of residual cavitation nuclei between pulses with gated sonications. The heating capability was not affected by the gated sonications, and similar temperature increases were reached at focus with both types of sonications when sonicating at equivalent acoustic power, both in water or after propagation through a human skull (+15 °C at 325 W for 10 s). These data, acquired with a clinical system, suggest that gated sonication could be an alternative to continuous sonications when cavitation onset is an issue.","1525-8955","","10.1109/TUFFC.2020.3036774","FUS Foundation through the Robert Merkin Fellowship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9252112","Biomedical acoustics;biomedical transducers;cavitation;focused ultrasound surgery","Acoustics;Transducers;Ultrasonic imaging;Skull;Heating systems;Logic gates;Fluorescence","biological tissues;biomedical MRI;biomedical transducers;biomedical ultrasonics;biothermics;brain;bubbles;cavitation;dosimetry;temperature measurement;ultrasonic therapy;ultrasonic transducers","pseudorandom sonications;transcranial high-intensity focused ultrasound;cavitation threshold;pseudorandom gated sonications;cavitation activity;human skull;CW sonications;gated sonication;continuous sonications","High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Ablation;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Neurosurgery;Neurosurgical Procedures;Skull;Sonication","1","","46","IEEE","9 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Single inductors as well as an array of inductors are modeled. The coil strength (~100 nH) and excitation parameters (peak current of 1–5 A, voltages of 16–20 V) are based on a formative feasibility study conducted by our group. In that study, intracochlear micromagnetic stimulation achieved auditory activation as measured through the auditory brainstem response in a feline model. With respect to the finite element simulations, axial symmetry of the inductor geometry is exploited to improve computation time. It is verified that the inductor coil orientation greatly affects the strength of the induced electric field and thereby the ability to affect the transmembrane potential of nearby neural elements. Furthermore, upon comparing an array of micro-inductors with a typical multi-site electrode array, magnetically excited arrays retain greater focus in terms of the gradient of induced electric fields.

With accurate and fast depth of anaesthesia measuring, the monitor can reduce the incidence of awareness during surgical operation. The proposed denoising method for extracting 40-Hz auditory steady-state cycles, adaptive multilevel wavelet denoising, enabled the system to extract auditory steady-state response cycles from fewer epochs and over short periods of time which is of crucial importance in monitoring anaesthesia. The noise estimation scheme, adaptive threshold levels, rearranging, and multilevel denoising of frames increase the accuracy and signal to noise ratio of the extracted cycles. The modified fuzzy c-means clustering scheme, proposed to improve clustering performance in noisy data bases where no prior information about the level of noise and signal energy is available, is used for clustering the auditory steady-state cycles. Weighting the features with a novel algorithm and based on their differentiating role in clustering, the modified fuzzy c-means improves fuzziness in cluster partitions and the geometrical structure of the data. An index called depth of anaesthesia index is defined and determined at each cycle based on the clustering information of the cycle and the previous ones. The algorithm is applied to auditory steady-state response signals recorded from 20 human subjects during surgical operations with Propofol-induced general anaesthesia.

However, due to the unpredictable tissue deformation associated with needle insertion and the complexity of many surgical scenarios, a real-time path planning algorithm with high update frequency would be advantageous. Real-time path planning for nonholonomic systems is commonly used in a broad variety of fields, ranging from aerospace to submarine navigation. In this letter, we propose to take advantage of the architecture of graphics processing units (GPUs) to apply fractal theory and thus parallelize real-time path planning computation. This novel approach, termed adaptive fractal trees (AFT), allows for the creation of a database of paths covering the entire domain, which are dense, invariant, procedurally produced, adaptable in size, and present a recursive structure. The generated cache of paths can in turn be analyzed in parallel to determine the most suitable path in a fraction of a second. The ability to cope with nonholonomic constraints, as well as constraints in the space of states of any complexity or number, is intrinsic to the AFT approach, rendering it highly versatile. Three-dimensional (3-D) simulations applied to needle steering in neurosurgery show that our approach can successfully compute paths in real-time, enabling complex brain navigation.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2016.2528292","European Research Council; European Union Seventh Framework Programme(grant numbers:FP7/2007-2013,258642-STING); CDT in NDE; EPSRC; Rolls-Royce; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7403913","Reactive and Sensor-Based Planning;Surgical Robotics: Steerable Catheters/Needles;Reactive and Sensor-Based Planning;Surgical Robotics: Steerable Catheters/Needles","Path planning;Needles;Fractals;Real-time systems;Graphics processing units;Aerospace electronics;Surgery","fractals;medical robotics;needles;path planning;surgery;trees (mathematics)","fractal tree-based path planning;programmable bevel tip steerable needle;minimally invasive surgery;anatomical region;unpredictable tissue deformation;needle insertion;surgical scenario;real-time path planning algorithm;update frequency;nonholonomic system;aerospace navigation;submarine navigation;graphics processing unit;GPU;fractal theory;parallelize real-time path planning computation;adaptive fractal tree;AFT;recursive structure;nonholonomic constraint;three-dimensional simulation;3D simulation;needle steering;neurosurgery;brain navigation","","22","","46","IEEE","11 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Twelve children and adolescents with planovalgus foot deformity secondary to spastic cerebral palsy participated in this outcome study. The pediatric population were evaluated preoperatively and following subtalar fusion. Seventeen feet were operated for the correction of the planovalgus foot deformity. A Holter-type microprocessor-based portable in-shoe data acquisition system was used in this study to collect the multistep dynamic plantar pressure history, while a five-camera Vicon-based gait analysis system was used to track the lower extremity joint kinematics. The results obtained from the plantar pressure measurement showed significant increases in mean peak vertical planter pressures postoperatively at the lateral midfoot and lateral metatarsal heads. Mean contact durations and mean pressure-time integrals were also significantly increased at these plantar locations following foot surgery. This redistribution in pressure metrics suggests the formation of new lateral planter weight bearing areas. The 3-D gait analysis system, using standardized lower extremity measurements, was unable to reveal any significant changes in joint kinematics, particularly at the foot and ankle where the surgery was performed. This suggests the need for a more refined system to track the complex motion of the pediatric foot and ankle during gait.","1558-0210","","10.1109/7333.928580","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=928580","","Surgery;Foot;Birth disorders;Pressure measurement;Extremities;Kinematics;Pediatrics;Data acquisition;History;Performance analysis","gait analysis;surgery;patient rehabilitation;brain;kinematics;paediatrics;pressure measurement;biomedical measurement","surgical rehabilitation;planovalgus foot;cerebral palsy;subtalar arthrodesis effects determination;adolescents;pediatric population;planovalgus foot deformity;Holter-type microprocessor-based portable in-shoe data acquisition system;multistep dynamic plantar pressure history;five-camera Vicon-based gait analysis system;lower extremity joint kinematics;lateral planter weight bearing areas;pressure metrics redistribution","Adolescent;Ankle;Biomechanics;Cerebral Palsy;Child;Electromyography;Female;Foot;Foot Deformities;Foot Deformities;Gait;Humans;Male;Orthopedic Procedures;Treatment Outcome","19","","64","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The cure for epilepsy is surgery and medication. Some patients are not cured with surgery and medicine. One third of the cases still remain with unrestrained epilepsy. There is an existing need of constant monitoring for epileptic seizures in this kind of cases. Treatment can be better provided by the doctors if seizure or any atypical brain activity is predicted before its happening or preventive measures can be taken by the patients themselves also if occurrence of the seizure is predicted beforehand. In inter-ictal and postictal periods brain behaves normally. In case of epilepsy, long time EEG recording are essential from days to week. This ultimately reside the patients in the hospital for too many days. Our proposed methodology is on the way to predict the epileptic seizure prior to its occurrence and administer the brain abnormality in real time. There is no such epileptic seizure prediction algorithm using EEG for clinical applications. Our aim is to learn and develop a good epileptic seizure prediction method/algorithm using scalp EEG i.e. noninvasive approach or by using HVR. The proposed pattern detection approach to be used in real time monitoring for patients of epilepsy has great potential and it can be helpful in civilizing the quality of life of the patients.

In medical practice, the localization of the epileptogenic area or region in the brain is the primary task for the effectiveness of the epilepsy surgery. The epileptogenic region is identified based on the presence of focal electroencephalogram (EEG) signals during recording. Therefore, the classification of focal (FL) and non-focal (NFL) classes of EEG channels is the prerequisite to identify the epileptogenic regions in the brain. In this paper, a hybrid approach based on the combination of the band or rhythm specific Fourier-Bessel series expansion domain empirical wavelet transform (FBSE-EWT) filter bank and sparse autoencoder (SAE) based support vector machine (SAE-SVM) network is proposed for the categorization of FL and NFL types of EEG channels. The rhythms such as δ, θ, α, β, and y are obtained from the EEG signal of each channel using FBSE-EWT filter bank. The SAE-SVM network classifies the FL and NFL categories of EEG channels directly from the rhythms. The results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid approach has 100% accuracy for the classification of FL and NFL types using the δ-rhythms of EEG signals for both channels. The approach extracts learnable features in the SAE stage, and these features have higher performance as compared to the existing features for the categorization of FL and NFL types of EEG channels.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2020.2995749","OPERA Grant, BITS Pilani(grant numbers:FR/SCM/150618/EEE); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9096344","Focal seizures;electroencephalogram;rhythm specific FBSE-EWT;SAE-SVM;accuracy","Electroencephalography;Rhythm;Feature extraction;Epilepsy;Discrete wavelet transforms;Sensors","channel bank filters;electroencephalography;feature extraction;Fourier series;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;signal classification;support vector machines;surgery;wavelet transforms","EEG channels;epileptogenic region;brain;sparse autoencoder based support vector machine;EEG signal;FBSE-EWT filter bank;SAE-SVM network;focal seizure area;FBSE-EWT rhythm;neurological pathology;nerve cell activity;recurrent seizures;epileptogenic area;epilepsy surgery;focal electroencephalogram signals;rhythm specific Fourier-Bessel series expansion domain empirical wavelet transform filter bank","","21","","75","IEEE","19 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this solution, informative components of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data are extracted and an automatic method is presented using Infinite Independent Component Analysis (I-ICA) to select efficiently independent features. The feature space is divided into subspaces via random selection, and multi-channel Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used to classify the subspaces, then, the result of each classifier is combined by majority voting to find the final output.

Although different monitoring systems estimating antinociception effect during general anesthesia are available, the performance of these indices is limited. The aim of this study was to develop a predictive model of the probability of movement if a standardized tetanic stimulation is applied to the patient, using the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal as input. Seventy-seven female patients, scheduled for ambulatory gynecologic surgical procedures under general anesthesia, were included. EEG segments of 45s, preceding tetanic stimulation, were split into epochs of 5s with no overlapping. Features from both time and frequency domain, including continuous wavelet transform (CWT), were considered. Five different machine learning (ML) models were tested: 1D CNN model for raw EEG signal, random forest classifier, XGBoost classifier and support vector classifier for extracted features and finally 2D CNN model for CWT scalogram. The results showed that the performance of the proposed ML models to predict movement to standardized tetanic stimulation through the EEG signal was almost equal to the performance of commercially available indices (AUC=0.73). This performance was improved (AUC=0.84) with ML methods in ensemble mode with pupil diameter and remifentanil effect site concentration. Indeed, prediction of movement to noxious stimulation through the EEG signal matches state of the art and could potentially be used in combination of other variables.","","978-1-7281-9048-8","10.1109/SSCI50451.2021.9660114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660114","deep learning;electroencephalogram;general anesthesia;machine learning;nociception","Continuous wavelet transforms;Wavelet domain;Surgery;Support vector machine classification;Predictive models;Brain modeling;Anesthesia","electroencephalography;feature extraction;haemodynamics;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;neurophysiology;wavelet transforms","standardized painful stimulation;anesthesia;antinociception levels;hemodynamic reactions;monitoring systems;predictive model;standardized tetanic stimulation;electroencephalogram signal;seventy-seven female patients;ambulatory gynecologic surgical procedures;frequency domain;machine learning models;1D CNN model;raw EEG signal;random forest classifier;support vector classifier;2D CNN model;ML models;noxious stimulation;continuous wavelet transform;XGBoost classifier","","","","13","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many algorithms have been proposed for the automatic detection of epileptic seizures using traditional machine learning and deep learning. Although deep learning methods have achieved great success in many fields, their performance in EEG analysis and classification is still limited mainly due to the relatively small sizes of available datasets. In this paper, we propose an automatic method for the detection of epileptic seizures based on deep metric learning which is a novel strategy tackling the few-shot problem by mitigating the demand for massive data. First, two one-dimensional convolutional embedding modules are proposed as a deep feature extractor, for single-channel and multichannel EEG signals respectively. Then, a deep metric learning model is detailed along with a stage-wise training strategy. Experiments are conducted on the publicly-available Bonn University dataset which is a benchmark dataset, and the CHB-MIT dataset which is larger and more realistic. Impressive averaged accuracy of 98.60% and specificity of 100% are achieved on the most difficult classification of interictal (subset D) vs ictal (subset E) of the Bonn dataset. On the CHB-MIT dataset, an averaged accuracy of 86.68% and specificity of 93.71% are reached. With the proposed method, automatic and accurate detection of seizures can be performed in real time, and the heavy burden of neurologists can be effectively reduced.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2021.3138852","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672070,62173010); Key Project of Beijing Municipal Education Commission(grant numbers:KZ201910005008); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality(grant numbers:4202025,4192005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9664005","Deep learning;electroencephalography (EEG);epilepsy;metric learning","Electroencephalography;Measurement;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Convolution;Training;Epilepsy","electroencephalography;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical disorders;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;signal classification","Bonn dataset;CHB-MIT dataset;automatic method;epileptic seizure detection;commonly used clinical approach;life-threatening neurological disorder;automatic detection;epileptic seizures;deep learning methods;deep feature extractor;deep metric learning model;stage-wise training strategy;publicly-available Bonn University dataset;benchmark dataset","Algorithms;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Humans;Machine Learning;Seizures;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","2","","57","IEEE","28 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Diagnostic procedures for epilepsy and monitoring are highly specialized and labour-intensive. The accuracy of the diagnosis is also complicated by overlapping medical symptoms, varying levels of experience and inter-observer variability among clinical professions. This paper proposes a novel hybrid bilinear deep learning network with an application in the clinical procedures of epilepsy classification diagnosis, where the use of surface electroencephalogram (sEEG) and audiovisual monitoring is standard practice. Hybrid bilinear models based on two types of feature extractors, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), are trained using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) of one-second sEEG. In the proposed hybrid models, CNNs extract spatio-temporal patterns, while RNNs focus on the characteristics of temporal dynamics in relatively longer intervals given the same input data. Second-order features, based on interactions between these spatio-temporal features are further explored by bilinear pooling and used for epilepsy classification. Our proposed methods obtain an F1-score of 97.4% on the Temple University Hospital Seizure Corpus and 97.2% on the EPILEPSIAE dataset, comparing favourably to existing benchmarks for sEEG-based seizure type classification.

These recordings are a window to understanding how the human brain processes information and subsequently behaves in healthy and pathologic states. Here, we describe and implement delay differential analysis (DDA) for the characterization of ECoG data obtained from human patients with intractable epilepsy. DDA is a time-domain analysis framework based on embedding theory in nonlinear dynamics that reveals the nonlinear invariant properties of an unknown dynamical system. The DDA embedding serves as a low-dimensional nonlinear dynamical basis onto which the data are mapped. This greatly reduces the risk of overfitting and improves the method's ability to fit classes of data. Since the basis is built on the dynamical structure of the data, preprocessing of the data (e.g., filtering) is not necessary. We performed a large-scale search for a DDA model that best fit ECoG recordings using a genetic algorithm to qualitatively discriminate between different cortical states and epileptic events for a set of 13 patients. A single DDA model with only three polynomial terms was identified. Singular value decomposition across the feature space of the model revealed both global and local dynamics that could differentiate electrographic and electroclinical seizures and provided insights into highly localized seizure onsets and diffuse seizure terminations. Other common ECoG features such as interictal periods, artifacts, and exogenous stimuli were also analyzed with DDA. This novel framework for signal processing of seizure information demonstrates an ability to reveal unique characteristics of the underlying dynamics of the seizure and may be useful in better understanding, detecting, and maybe even predicting seizures.","0899-7667","","10.1162/neco_a_01009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8124216","","","","","","1","","","Traditional","29 Nov 2017","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Highly dexterous skills are necessary to procedure success. However, few effective methods can be applied to PCI skill assessment. In this study, ten interventional cardiologists (four experts and six novices) were recruited. In vivo studies were performed via delivering a medical guidewire into distal left circumflex artery (target vessel I) and obtuse marginal artery (target vessel II) of a porcine model. Regarded as a type of manipulation data, the guidewire motion is simultaneously acquired with an electromagnetic (EM) sensor attached to guidewire tail. To address the deficiency of conventional dynamic time warping (DTW) limited to two-sequence matching, a novel warping algorithm is proposed to match multiple manipulation data. Then the intra-similarity is calculated to evaluate consistencies among each subject’s different manipulations, while the inter-similarity is further analyzed to find skill differences among different subjects. Extensive statistical analysis demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can effectively distinguish between the manipulations made by different skill-level subjects with significant differences on the target vessel I ( $P = 3.25\times 10^{-4}$ ) and II ( $P = 7.30\times 10^{-3}$ ).

First, the wavelet transform method is used to analyze the anesthesia monitoring EEG signals, and the extracted features are clustered by wavelet classifier to estimate the depth of anesthesia. Second, the characteristics of eigenvectors are constructed by a singular value decomposition based on wavelet transform coefficients. The extraction method extracts the characteristics of the mid-latency auditory evoked EEG under anesthesia. Finally, this paper collected a large amount of clinical data and established a clinical database of anesthesia depth. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the method.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2907794","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8675269","Wavelet transform;anesthesia monitoring;signal analysis;feature extraction","Anesthesia;Wavelet transforms;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Wavelet analysis;Monitoring","auditory evoked potentials;electroencephalography;feature extraction;medical signal processing;singular value decomposition;surgery;wavelet transforms","feature extraction;EEG signals;anesthesia monitoring;anesthesia signal monitoring;wavelet transform method;wavelet classifier;extraction method;biomedical engineering","","5","","21","OAPA","27 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper presents the design, fabrication, and validation of a programmable multi-biomarker neural sensor which can be integrated into closed-loop DBS devices. The device is capable of sensing a combination of low-frequency (7–45 Hz), and high-frequency (200–1000 Hz) neural signals. The signals can be amplified with a digitally programmable gain within the range of 50–100 dB. The neural signals can be stored into a local memory for processing and validation. The sensing and storage functions are implemented via a combination of analog and digital circuits involving pre-amplifiers, filters, programmable post-amplifiers, microcontroller, digital potentiometer, and flash memory. The device is fabricated, and its performance is validated through: 1) bench tests using sinusoidal and pre-recorded neural signals; 2) in-vitro tests using pre-recorded neural signals in saline solution; and 3) in-vivo tests by recording neural signals from freely moving laboratory mice. The animals were implanted with a PlasticsOne electrode, and recording was conducted after recovery from the electrode implantation surgery. The experimental results are presented and discussed confirming the successful operation of the device. The size and weight of the device enable tetherless back-mountable use in pre-clinical trials.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885336","Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(grant numbers:R01NS089664,R01NS100874); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8567905","Circuits;closed-loop;multiple biomarkers;neural sensor;programmable","Satellite broadcasting;Electrodes;Hafnium compounds;Connectors;Pediatrics;Monitoring;Epilepsy","","","","5","","63","OAPA","7 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

But how is this feat achieved? The virtue of such a descriptive model is contingent on a mechanistic understanding of how motor execution is altered in specific circumstances. In this report, we provide evidence that the well-known phenomenon of slowed RTs following mistakes (post-error slowing) is directly influenced by the degree of subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity. The STN is proposed to act as a brake on motor execution following conflict or errors, buying time so a more cautious response can be made on the next trial. STN local field potentials from nine Parkinson disease patients undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery were recorded while they performed a response conflict task. In a 2.5- to 5-Hz frequency range previously associated with conflict and error processing, the degree phase consistency preceding the response was associated with increasingly slower RTs specifically following errors. These findings provide compelling evidence that post-error slowing is in part mediated by a corticosubthalamic “hyperdirect” pathway for increased response caution.","0898-929X","","10.1162/jocn_a_00659","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6928637","","","","","","","","","","17 Oct 2014","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

In more than 30 % of the cases, people affected by this disease cannot be cured with medicines or surgery. However, predicting a seizure before it actually occurs can help in its prevention; through therapeutic intervention. Studies have observed that abnormal activity inside the brain begins a few minutes before the start of a seizure, which is known as preictal state. Many researchers have tried to find a way for predicting this preictal state of a seizure but an effective prediction in terms of high sensitivity and specificity still remains a challenge. The current study, proposes a seizure prediction system that employs deep learning methods. This method includes preprocessing of scalp EEG signals, automated features extraction; using convolution neural network and classification with the support of vector machines. The proposed method has been applied on 24 subjects of scalp EEG dataset of CHBMIT resulting in successfully achieving an average sensitivity and specificity of 92.7% and 90.8% respectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2976866","Bahria University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9016244","Epilepsy prediction;seizures;preictal state;scalp EEG;intracranial EEG;deep learning;CNN","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Scalp;Machine learning;Prediction methods;Support vector machines;Electrodes","convolutional neural nets;diseases;electroencephalography;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical disorders;medical signal processing;neurophysiology","seizure prediction system;deep learning methods;epileptic seizures prediction;deep learning techniques;neurological disease;therapeutic intervention;preictal state prediction;scalp EEG signals;automated features extraction;convolution neural network","","59","","94","CCBY","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
