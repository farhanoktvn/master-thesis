C;Hyperspectral Imaging for In-Vivo/Ex-Vivo Tissue Analysis of Human Brain Cancer;Accurate identification of tumor boundaries during brain cancer surgery determines the quality of life of the patient. Different intraoperative guidance tools are currently employed during the resection tumor but having several limitations. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is arising as a label-free and non-ionizing technique that could assist neurosurgeons during surgical procedures. In this paper, an analysis between in-vivo and ex-vivo human brain tumor samples using HSI has been performed to evaluate the correlation between both types of samples. Spectral ratios of the oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin were employed to distinguish between normal tissue, tumor tissue and blood vessels. A database composed by seven in-vivo and fourteen ex-vivo hyperspectral images obtained from seven different patients diagnosed with glioblastoma Grade IV, metastatic secondary breast cancer, meningioma Grade I and II, and astrocytoma (glioma) Grade II. 44,964 pixels labeled pixels were employed in this work. The proposed method achieved discrimination between different tissue types using the proposed spectral ratio. Comparison between in-vivo and ex-vivo samples indicated that ex-vivo samples generate higher hemoglobin ratios. Moreover, vascular enhanced maps were generated using the spectral ratio, targeting real-time intraoperative surgical assistance.;2022;10.1117/12.2611420
C;Single-pixel hyperspectral imaging for real-time cancer detection: detecting damage in ex vivo porcine tissue samples;We are developing a single-pixel hyperspectral imaging system based on compressive sensing that acquires spatial and spectral information simultaneously. Our spectral imaging system uses autofluorescencent emission from collagen (400 nm) and NAD(P)H (475 nm), as well as, differences in the optical reflectance spectra as diagnostics for differentiating between healthy and diseased tissue. In this study, we demonstrate the ability of our imaging system to discriminate between healthy and damaged porcine epidermal tissue. Healthy porcine epidermal tissue samples (n=11) were imaged ex vivo using our hyperspectral system. The amount of NAD(P) H emission and the reflectance properties were approximately constant across the surface of healthy tissue samples. The tissue samples were then thermally damaged using an 1850 nm thulium fiber laser and re-imaged after laser irradiation. The damaged regions were clearly visible in the hyperspectral images as the thermal damage altered the fluorescent emission of NAD(P) H and changed the scattering properties of the tissue. The extent of the damaged regions was determined based on the hyperspectral images and these estimates were compared to damage extents measured in white light images acquired with a traditional camera. The extent of damage determined via hyperspectral imaging was in good agreement with estimates based on white light imaging indicating that our system is capable of differentiating between healthy and damaged tissue. Possible applications of our single pixel hyperspectral imaging system range from real-time determination of tumor margins during surgery to the use of this technique in the pathology lab to aid with cancer diagnosis and staging.;2016;10.1117/12.2211408
J;Multispectral confocal microendoscope for in vivo and in situ imaging;We describe the design and operation of a multispectral confocal microendoscope. This fiber-based fluorescence imaging system consists of a slit-scan confocal microscope coupled to an imaging catheter that is designed to be minimally invasive and allow for cellular level imaging in vivo. The system can operate in two imaging modes. The grayscale mode of operation provides high resolution real-time in vivo images showing the intensity of fluorescent signal from the specimen. The multispectral mode of operation uses a prism as a dispersive element to collect a full multispectral image of the fluorescence emission. The instrument can switch back and forth nearly instantaneously between the two imaging modes (less than half a second). In the current configuration, the multispectral confocal microendoscope achieves 3-mu m lateral resolution and 30-mu m axial resolution. The system records light from 500 to 750 nm, and the minimum resolvable wavelength difference varies from 2.9 to 8.3 nm over this spectral range. Grayscale and multispectral imaging results from ex-vivo human tissues and small animal tissues are presented. (C) 2008 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.;2008;10.1117/1.2950313
C;Hyperspectral angular domain imaging for ex-vivo breast tumor detection;An angular domain spectroscopic imaging system was built and validated using fresh ex vivo breast tissue samples (similar to 2 mm thick). The hyperspectral system consisted of a halogen lamp, collimation optics, scanning stage with controller, a silicon micro-machined micro-channel array, and a pushbroom spectral imager. As a proof of concept, spectral data cubes acquired from tissue samples were input into principal component analysis and Mahalanobis discriminant analysis to differentiate between spectral signatures of breast tumor and normal tissue. It is proposed that the results from training sets can be used to construct a set of classifiers to enable tumor detection in samples representative of the surgical margins.;2013;10.1117/12.2004663
J;Intraoperative multispectral and hyperspectral label-free imaging: A systematic review of in vivo clinical studies;Multispectral and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) are emerging optical imaging techniques with the potential to transform the way surgery is performed but it is not clear whether current systems are capable of delivering real-time tissue characterization and surgical guidance. We conducted a systematic review of surgical in vivo label-free multispectral and HSI systems that have been assessed intraoperatively in adult patients, published over a 10-year period to May 2018. We analysed 14 studies including 8 different HSI systems. Current in-vivo HSI systems generate an intraoperative tissue oxygenation map or enable tumour detection. Intraoperative tissue oxygenation measurements may help to predict those patients at risk of postoperative complications and in-vivo intraoperative tissue characterization may be performed with high specificity and sensitivity. All systems utilized a line-scanning or wavelength-scanning method but the spectral range and number of spectral bands employed varied significantly between studies and according to the system's clinical aim. The time to acquire a hyperspectral cube dataset ranged between 5 and 30 seconds. No safety concerns were reported in any studies. A small number of studies have demonstrated the capabilities of intraoperative in-vivo label-free HSI but further work is needed to fully integrate it into the current surgical workflow.;2019;10.1002/jbio.201800455
J;Preliminary Results of Ex Vivo Multispectral Photoacoustic Imaging in the Management of Thyroid Cancer;OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to validate whether ex vivo multispectral photoacoustic imaging can be used to differentiate malignant tissue, benign nodules, and normal human thyroid tissue. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Fifty patients undergoing thyroidectomy because of thyroid lesions participated in this study. Multispectral photoacoustic imaging was performed on surgically excised thyroid tissue, and chromophore images that represented optical absorption of deoxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, lipid, and water were reconstructed. After the imaging procedure, the pathologist marked malignant tissue, benign nodules, and normal regions on histopathologic slides, and digital images of the marked histopathologic slides were obtained. The histopathologic images were coregistered with chromophore images. Areas corresponding to malignant tissue, benign nodules, and normal tissue were defined on the chromophore images. Pixel values within each area were averaged to determine the mean intensities of deoxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, lipid, and water. RESULTS. There was a statistically significant difference between malignant and benign nodules with respect to mean intensity of deoxyhemoglobin (p = 0.014). There was a difference between malignant and normal tissue in mean intensity of deoxyhemoglobin (p = 0.003), lipid (p = 0.001), and water (p < 0.0001). A difference between benign nodules and normal tissue was found in mean intensity of oxyhemoglobin (p < 0.0001), lipid (p < 0.0001), and water (p < 0.0001). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the system tested in differentiating malignant from nonmalignant thyroid tissue were 69.2%, 96.9%, 81.8%, and 93.9%. CONCLUSION. The preliminary results of this ex vivo human thyroid study suggest that multispectral photoacoustic imaging can be used to differentiate malignant and benign nodules and normal human thyroid tissue.;2014;10.2214/AJR.13.11433
J;In-Vivo and Ex-Vivo Tissue Analysis through Hyperspectral Imaging Techniques: Revealing the Invisible Features of Cancer;In contrast to conventional optical imaging modalities, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is able to capture much more information from a certain scene, both within and beyond the visual spectral range (from 400 to 700 nm). This imaging modality is based on the principle that each material provides different responses to light reflection, absorption, and scattering across the electromagnetic spectrum. Due to these properties, it is possible to differentiate and identify the different materials/substances presented in a certain scene by their spectral signature. Over the last two decades, HSI has demonstrated potential to become a powerful tool to study and identify several diseases in the medical field, being a non-contact, non-ionizing, and a label-free imaging modality. In this review, the use of HSI as an imaging tool for the analysis and detection of cancer is presented. The basic concepts related to this technology are detailed. The most relevant, state-of-the-art studies that can be found in the literature using HSI for cancer analysis are presented and summarized, both in-vivo and ex-vivo. Lastly, we discuss the current limitations of this technology in the field of cancer detection, together with some insights into possible future steps in the improvement of this technology.;2019;10.3390/cancers11060756
C;Tissue classification for laparoscopic image understanding based on multispectral texture analysis;Intra-operative tissue classification is one of the prerequisites for providing context-aware visualization in computer assisted minimally invasive surgeries. As many anatomical structures are difficult to differentiate in conventional RGB medical images, we propose a classification method based on multispectral image patches. In a comprehensive ex vivo study we show (1) that multispectral imaging data is superior to RGB data for organ tissue classification when used in conjunction with widely applied feature descriptors and (2) that combining the tissue texture with the reflectance spectrum improves the classification performance. Multispectral tissue analysis could thus evolve as a key enabling technique in computer-assisted laparoscopy.;2016;10.1117/12.2216090

C;Hyperspectral imaging based on compressive sensing to determine cancer margins in human pancreatic tissue ex vivo;Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the US. Currently, surgery is the only treatment that offers a chance of cure, however, accurately identifying tumor margins in real-time is difficult. Research has demonstrated that optical spectroscopy can be used to distinguish between healthy and diseased tissue. The design of a single-pixel imaging system for cancer detection is discussed. The system differentiates between healthy and diseased tissue based on differences in the optical reflectance spectra of these regions. In this study, pancreatic tissue samples from 6 patients undergoing Whipple procedures are imaged with the system (total number of tissue sample imaged was N=11). Regions of healthy and unhealthy tissue are determined based on SAM analysis of these spectral images. Hyperspectral imaging results are then compared to white light imaging and histological analysis. Cancerous regions were clearly visible in the hyperspectral images. Margins determined via spectral imaging were in good agreement with margins identified by histology, indicating that hyperspectral imaging system can differentiate between healthy and diseased tissue. After imaging the system was able to detect cancerous regions with a sensitivity of 74.50 +/- 5.89% and a specificity of 75.53 +/- 10.81%. Possible applications of this imaging system include determination of tumor margins during surgery/biopsy and assistance with cancer diagnosis and staging.;2017;10.1117/12.2250387
J;Feasibility of Ex Vivo Margin Assessment with Hyperspectral Imaging during Breast-Conserving Surgery: From Imaging Tissue Slices to Imaging Lumpectomy Specimen;"Developing algorithms for analyzing hyperspectral images as an intraoperative tool for margin assessment during breast-conserving surgery requires a dataset with reliable histopathologic labels. The feasibility of using tissue slices hyperspectral dataset with a high correlation with histopathology for developing an algorithm for analyzing the images from the surface of lumpectomy specimens was investigated. We presented a method to acquire hyperspectral images from the lumpectomy surface with a high correlation with histopathology. The tissue slices dataset was compared with the dataset obtained on lumpectomy specimen and the wavelengths with a penetration depth up to the minimum sample thickness of the tissue slices were used to develop a tissue classification algorithm. Spectral differences were observed between tissue slices and lumpectomy datasets due to differences in the sample thickness between both datasets; wavelengths with a high penetration depth were able to penetrate through the thinner tissue slices, affecting the captured signal. By using only wavelengths with a penetration depth up to the minimum sample thickness of the tissue slices, the adipose tissue could be discriminated from other tissue types, but differentiating malignant from connective tissue was more challenging.</p>";2021;10.3390/app11198881
J;Hyperspectral imaging for diagnosis and detection of ex-vivo breast cancer;Background and purpose: Breast cancer is one of the most widely recognized tumors. .Diagnosis made in the early stage of disease may imporve outcomes. The discovery of malignant growth utilizing noninvasive light intrusive methods in lieu of conventional excisional biopsy may assist in achieving this goal. Materials and methods: The change of the optical properties of ex-vivo breast tissues provides different responses to light transmission, absorption, and particularly the reflection over the spectrum range. We offer the use of Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) with advanced image processing and pattern recognition in order to analyze HSI data for breast cancer detection. The spectral signatures were mined and evaluated in both malignant and normal tissue. K-mean clustering was designed for classifying hyperspectral data in order to evaluate and detection of cancer tissue. This method was used to detect ex-vivo breast cancer. Spatial spectral images were created to high spot the differences in the reflectance properties of malignant versus normal tissue. Results: Trials showed that the superficial spectral reflection images within 500 nm wavelength showed high variance (214.65) between cancerous and normal breast tissues. On the other hand, image within 620 nm wavelength showed low variance (0.0020).However, the superimposed of spectral region 420-620 nm was proposed as the optimum bandwidth. Finally, the proposed HS imaging system was capable to discriminate the tumor region from normal tissue of the ex-vivo breast sample with sensitivity and a specificity of 95 % and 96 %. Conclusions: High sensitivity and specificity were achieved, which proposes potential for HSI as an edge evaluation method to enhance the surgical outcome compared to the presently available techniques in the clinics.;2020;10.1016/j.pdpdt.2020.101922
C;Multispectral tissue analysis and classification towards enabling automated robotic surgery;Accurate optical characterization of different tissue types is an important tool for potentially guiding surgeons and enabling automated robotic surgery. Multispectral imaging and analysis have been used in the literature to detect spectral variations in tissue reflectance that may be visible to the naked eye. Using this technique, hidden structures can be visualized and analyzed for effective tissue classification. Here, we investigated the feasibility of automated tissue classification using multispectral tissue analysis. Broadband reflectance spectra (200-1050 nm) were collected from nine different ex vivo porcine tissues types using an optical fiber-probe based spectrometer system. We created a mathematical model to train and distinguish different tissue types based upon analysis of the observed spectra using total principal component regression (TPCR). Compared to other reported methods, our technique is computationally inexpensive and suitable for real-time implementation. Each of the 92 spectra was cross-referenced against the nine tissue types. Preliminary results show a mean detection rate of 91.3%, with detection rates of 100% and 70.0% (inner and outer kidney), 100% and 100% (inner and outer liver), 100% (outer stomach), and 90.9%, 100%, 70.0%, 85.7% (four different inner stomach areas, respectively). We conclude that automated tissue differentiation using our multispectral tissue analysis method is feasible in multiple ex vivo tissue specimens. Although measurements were performed using ex vivo tissues, these results suggest that real-time, in vivo tissue identification during surgery may be possible.;2014;10.1117/12.2040627
J;Hyperspectral image-based analysis of thermal damage for ex-vivo bovine liver utilizing radiofrequency ablation;Background & objective: Thermal ablation is the predominant methodology to treat liver tumors for segregating patients who are not permitted to have surgical intervention. However, noticing or predicting the size of the thermal strategies is a challenging endeavor. We aim to analyze the effects of ablation district volume following radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of ex-vivo liver exploiting a custom Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) system. Materials and methods: RFA was conducted on the ex-vivo bovine liver at focal and peripheral blood vessel sites and observed by Custom HSI system, which has been designed to assess the exactness and proficiency using visible and near-infrared wavelengths region for tissue thermal effect. The experiment comprised up to ten trials with RFA. The experiment was carried out in two stages to assess the percentage of the thermal effect on the investigated sample superficially and for the side penetration effect. Measuring the diffuse reflectance (R , d) of the sample to identify the spectral reflectance shift which could differentiate between normal and ablated tissue exploiting the designed cross-correlation algorithm for monitoring of thermal ablation. Results: Determination of the diffuse reflection (R , d) spectral signature responses from normal, thermal effected, and thermal ablation regions of the investigated liver sample. Where the ideal wavelength range at (600-640 nm) could discriminate between these different regions. Then, exploited the converted RGB image of the HS liver tissue after RFA for more validations which shows that the optimum wavelength for differentiation at (530-560 nm and 600-640 nm). Finally, applying statistical analysis to validate our results presenting that wavelength 600 nm had the highest standard deviation (delta) to differentiate between various thermally affected regions regarding the normal tissue and wavelength 640 nm shows the highest (delta) to differentiate between the ablated and normal regions. Conclusion: The designed and implemented medical imaging system incorporated the hyperspectral camera capabilities with the associate cross-correlation algorithm that could successfully distinguish between the ablated and thermally affected regions to assist the surgery during the tumor therapy.;2021;10.1016/j.suronc.2021.101564
J;Blind source separation of ex-vivo aorta tissue multispectral images;Blind Source Separation methods (BSS) aim for the decomposition of a given signal in its main components or source signals. Those techniques have been widely used in the literature for the analysis of biomedical images, in order to extract the main components of an organ or tissue under study. The analysis of skin images for the extraction of melanin and hemoglobin is an example of the use of BSS. This paper presents a proof of concept of the use of source separation of ex-vivo aorta tissue multispectral Images. The images are acquired with an interference filter-based imaging system. The images are processed by means of two algorithms: Independent Components analysis and Non-negative Matrix Factorization. In both cases, it is possible to obtain maps that quantify the concentration of the main chromophores present in aortic tissue. Also, the algorithms allow for spectral absorbance of the main tissue components. Those spectral signatures were compared against the theoretical ones by using correlation coefficients. Those coefficients report values close to 0.9, which is a good estimator of the method's performance. Also, correlation coefficients lead to the identification of the concentration maps according to the evaluated chromophore. The results suggest that Multi/hyper-spectral systems together with image processing techniques is a potential tool for the analysis of cardiovascular tissue.

C;Automated classification of brain tissue: comparison between hyperspectral imaging and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy;In neurosurgery, technical solutions for visualizing the border between healthy brain and tumor tissue is of great value, since they enable the surgeon to achieve gross total resection while minimizing the risk of damage to eloquent areas. By using real-time non-ionizing imaging techniques, such as hyperspectral imaging (HSI), the spectral signature of the tissue is analyzed allowing tissue classification, thereby improving tumor boundary discrimination during surgery. More particularly, since infrared penetrates deeper in the tissue than visible light, the use of an imaging sensor sensitive to the near-infrared wavelength range would also allow the visualization of structures slightly beneath the tissue surface. This enables the visualization of tumors and vessel boundaries prior to surgery, thereby preventing the damaging of tissue structures. In this study, we investigate the use of Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) and HSI for brain tissue classification, by extracting spectral features from the near infra-red range. The applied method for classification is the linear Support Vector Machine (SVM). The study is conducted on ex-vivo porcine brain tissue, which is analyzed and classified as either white or gray matter. The DRS combined with the proposed classification reaches a sensitivity and specificity of 96%, while HSI reaches a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 93%. This feasibility study shows the potential of DRS and HSI for automated tissue classification, and serves as a first step towards clinical use for tumor detection deeper inside the tissue.;2021;10.1117/12.2548754
J;Hyperspectral Imaging of in vivo Tissues: A Review;Hyperspectral imaging method can obtain two-dimensional images and spectral information of in vivo tissues, which has the advantages of high spatial and spectral resolution, large imaging range, non-invasive nature, and fast speed, providing abundant information for in vivo tissue diagnosis.

In this study, the main advances of hyperspectral imaging methods and applications arc reviewed, and the spectral imaging methods, system composition, and characteristics arc discussed. This study introduces the research progress in in vivo tissue imaging methods and application in terms of spectral reconstruction, tissue optical parameter measurement, and image processing based on deep learning. Simultaneously, the application progress of hyperspectral imaging in clinical medicine, such as skin trauma and healing process detection, diagnosis of diabetic foot and retinal diseases, intraoperative detection, and microcirculation function evaluation, is also summarized.;2020;10.3788/LOP57.080002
J;Visible near infrared reflectance molecular chemical imaging of human ex vivo carcinomas and murine in vivo carcinomas;Significance: A key risk faced by oncological surgeons continues to be complete removal of tumor. Currently, there is no intraoperative imaging device to detect kidney tumors during excision. Aim: We are evaluating molecular chemical imaging (MCI) as a technology for real-time tumor detection and margin assessment during tumor removal surgeries. Approach: In exploratory studies, we evaluate visible near infrared (Vis-NIR) MCI for differentiating tumor from adjacent tissue in ex vivo human kidney specimens, and in anaesthetized mice with breast or lung tumor xenografts. Differentiation of tumor from nontumor tissues is made possible with diffuse reflectance spectroscopic signatures and hyperspectral imaging technology. Tumor detection is achieved by score image generation to localize the tumor, followed by application of computer vision algorithms to define tumor border. Results: Performance of a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model for kidney tumor in a 22-patient study is 0.96 for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. A PLS-DA model for in vivo breast and lung tumor xenografts performs with 100% sensitivity, 83% specificity, and 89% accuracy. Conclusion: Detection of cancer in surgically resected human kidney tissues is demonstrated ex vivo with Vis-NIR MCI, and in vivo on mice with breast or lung xenografts. (C) The Authors.

J;Imaging high-intensity focused ultrasound-induced tissue denaturation by multispectral photoacoustic method: an ex vivo study;We present an ex vivo study for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, in multispectral photoacoustic imaging (PAI) of tissue denaturation induced by high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) in this paper. Tissue of bovine muscle was thermally treated in a heated water bath and by HIFU, and then was imaged using a multispectral photoacoustic approach. Light at multiple optical wavelengths between 700 and 900 nm was delivered to the treated bovine muscle tissue to excite the photoacoustic signal. Apparent tissue denaturation has been observed in multispectral photoacoustic images after being treated in a water bath and by HIFU. It is interesting that the denaturation is more striking at shorter optical wavelength photoacoustic images than at longer optical wavelength photoacoustic images. Multispectral photoacoustic images of the tissue denaturation were further analyzed and the photoacoustic spectrums of the denaturized tissue were calculated in this paper. This study suggests that a multispectral PAI approachmight be a promising tool to evaluate tissue denaturation induced by HIFU treatment.

J;Image enhancement based on in vivo hyperspectral gastroscopic images: a case study;Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has been recognized as a powerful tool for noninvasive disease detection in the gastrointestinal field. However, most of the studies on HSI in this field have involved ex vivo biopsies or resected tissues. We proposed an image enhancement method based on in vivo hyperspectral gastroscopic images. First, we developed a flexible gastroscopy system capable of obtaining in vivo hyperspectral images of different types of stomach disease mucosa. Then, depending on a specific object, an appropriate band selection algorithm based on dependence of information was employed to determine a subset of spectral bands that would yield useful spatial information. Finally, these bands were assigned to be the color components of an enhanced image of the object. A gastric ulcer case study demonstrated that our method yields higher color tone contrast, which enhanced the displays of the gastric ulcer regions, and that it will be valuable in clinical applications.

We show the performance of the system for representative applications in high-resolution volumetric imaging of reporter animals and multispectral tissue analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of the economical imaging system in applications such as in vivo epifluorescence imaging, histology slide scanning, cell counting and gel electrophoresis documentation.;2014;
J;Real-Time Optoacoustic Tracking of Single Moving Micro-objects in Deep Phantom and Ex Vivo Tissues;Medical imaging plays an important role in diagnosis and treatment of multiple diseases. It is a field which seeks for improved sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution to allow the dynamic monitoring of diverse biological processes that occur at the micro- and nanoscale. Emerging technologies for targeted diagnosis and therapy such as nanotherapeutics, microimplants, catheters, and small medical tools also need to be precisely located and monitored while performing their function inside the human body. In this work, we show for the first time the real-time tracking of moving single micro-objects below centimeter thick phantom tissue and ex vivo chicken breast, using multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT). This technique combines the advantages of ultrasound imaging regarding depth and resolution with the molecular specificity of optical methods, thereby facilitating the discrimination between the spectral signatures of the micro-objects from those of intrinsic tissue molecules. The resulting MSOT signal is further improved in terms of contrast and specificity by coating the micro-objects' surface with gold nanorods, possessing a unique absorption spectrum, which facilitate their discrimination from surrounding biological tissues when translated to future in vivo settings.;2019;10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b02869
J;Rare-Earth Metal Ions Doped Graphene Quantum Dots for Near-IR In Vitro/In Vivo/Ex Vivo Imaging Applications;Near-infrared (NIR) emitting biocompatible nanomaterials are desired in biotechnology as higher penetration depth fluorescence imaging probes. In this work, novel NIR-emissive Nd3+-doped or Tm3+-doped biocompatible graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are developed via scalable, single-step bottom-up synthesis. Water-soluble Nd-GQDs/Tm-GQDs with average diameters of 5.6-8.2 nm possess crystalline graphene lattice with<1 atomic percent of Nd/Tm and exhibit NIR fluorescence at approximate to 1060/approximate to 925 nm attributed to the intrinsic transitions of Nd3+/Tm3+. High biocompatibility with>80% cell viability at 1 mg mL(-1)for Nd-GQDs and 0.25 mg mL(-1)for Tm-GQDs makes them well-suited for bioimaging. In vitro, both GQD types exhibit efficient internalization with their intracellular emission maximized at 6 h. The pH-dependence of this emission can serve as plethora of diagnostic applications. GQDs enable in vivo NIR imaging in live sedated NCr nude mice with IV administration: their NIR emission maximized at 6 h post-injection is primarily detected in intestine, kidneys, liver, and spleen, however, diminishing to none at 48 h. Ex vivo organ/slice imaging shows significant Tm-GQD fluorescence signatures in the aforementioned organs/slices. This capability of NIR fluorescence imaging in cells, tissues, and real-time detection in live animals makes biocompatible rare-earth metal-doped GQDs an attractive new candidate for in vitro/in vivo/ex vivo theranostics.;2020;10.1002/adom.202000897
J;Ex vivo photometric and polarimetric multilayer characterization of human healthy colon by multispectral Mueller imaging;Healthy human colon samples were analyzed ex vivo with a multispectral imaging Mueller polarimeter operating from 500 to 700 nm in a backscattering configuration with diffuse light illumination impinging on the innermost tissue layer, the mucosa. The intensity and polarimetric responses were taken on whole tissues first and after progressive exfoliation of the outer layers afterwards. Moreover, these measurements were carried out with two different substrates (one bright and the other dark) successively placed beneath each sample, allowing a reasonably accurate evaluation of the contributions to the overall backscattered light by the various layers. For the shorter investigated wavelengths (500 to 550 nm) the major contribution comes from mucosa and submucosa, while for the longer wavelengths (650 to 700 nm) muscular tissue and fat also contribute significantly. The depolarization has also been studied and is found to be stronger in the red part of the spectrum, mainly due to the highly depolarizing power of the muscular and fat layers.

C;Multispectral photoacoustic imaging of tissue denaturation induced by high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment;This paper presents an ex vivo study in imaging high-intensity focused ultrasound induced tissue denaturation with multispectral photoacoustic approach. Beef tissues treated by both water bath and high-intensity focused ultrasound were imaged and evaluated by photoacoustic imaging method, where light in multiple optical wavelengths between 700nm and 900nm is applied. Tissue denaturation after being treated by water bath and high-intensity focused ultrasound has been observed in multispectral photoacoustic images. The denaturation is more striking in relatively shorter optical wavelength photoacoustic images than in relatively longer optical wavelength photoacoustic images. This study suggests that multispectral photoacoustic imaging method is promising in the evaluation of tissue denaturation induced by high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment.;2013;10.1117/12.2004689
J;Multispectral Imaging for Automated Tissue Identification of Normal Human Surgical Specimens;Objective Safe surgery requires the accurate discrimination of tissue intraoperatively. We assess the feasibility of using multispectral imaging and deep learning to enhance surgical vision by automated identification of normal human head and neck tissues. Study Design Construction and feasibility testing of novel multispectral imaging system for surgery. Setting Academic university hospital. Subjects and Methods Multispectral images of fresh-preserved human cadaveric tissues were captured with our adapted digital operating microscope. Eleven tissue types were sampled, each sequentially exposed to 6 lighting conditions. Two convolutional neural network machine learning models were developed to classify tissues based on multispectral and white-light color images (ARRInet-M and ARRInet-W, respectively). Blinded otolaryngology residents were asked to identify tissue specimens from white-light color images, and their performance was compared with that of the ARRInet models. Results A novel multispectral imaging system was developed with minimal adaptation to an existing digital operating microscope. With 81.8% accuracy in tissue identification of full-size images, the multispectral ARRInet-M classifier outperformed the white-light-only ARRInet-W model (45.5%) and surgical residents (69.7%). Challenges with discrimination occurred with parotid vs fat and blood vessels vs nerve. Conclusions A deep learning model using multispectral imaging outperformed a similar model and surgical residents using traditional white-light imaging at the task of classifying normal human head and neck tissue ex vivo. These results suggest that multispectral imaging can enhance surgical vision and augment surgeons' ability to identify tissues during a procedure.;2021;10.1177/0194599820941013
J;Use of Hyperspectral/Multispectral Imaging in Gastroenterology. Shedding Some-Different-Light into the Dark;Hyperspectral/Multispectral imaging (HSI/MSI) technologies are able to sample from tens to hundreds of spectral channels within the electromagnetic spectrum, exceeding the capabilities of human vision. These spectral techniques are based on the principle that every material has a different response (reflection and absorption) to different wavelengths. Thereby, this technology facilitates the discrimination between different materials. HSI has demonstrated good discrimination capabilities for materials in fields, for instance, remote sensing, pollution monitoring, field surveillance, food quality, agriculture, astronomy, geological mapping, and currently, also in medicine. HSI technology allows tissue observation beyond the limitations of the human eye. Moreover, many researchers are using HSI as a new diagnosis tool to analyze optical properties of tissue. Recently, HSI has shown good performance in identifying human diseases in a non-invasive manner. In this paper, we show the potential use of these technologies in the medical domain, with emphasis in the current advances in gastroenterology. The main aim of this review is to provide an overview of contemporary concepts regarding HSI technology together with state-of-art systems and applications in gastroenterology. Finally, we discuss the current limitations and upcoming trends of HSI in gastroenterology.;2019;10.3390/jcm8010036
C;A random forest-based method for selection of regions of interest in hyperspectral images of ex vivo human skin;Hyperspectral imaging is a useful tool for characterization of human tissue. However, the vast amount of data created makes it challenging and tedious to manually select spatial regions of interest for further processing. In this study, a random forest-based method was evaluated on basis of its ability to segment human skin regions from the background. The method was compared to the performance of two alternative methods, spectral angle mapper (SAM) and a K-means clustering-based method. The methods were tested on hyperspectral images of ex vivo and in vivo human skin in the wavelength range 400-1000 nm. The random forest approach was found to be robust and perform well regardless of image type. The method is simple to train, and requires minimal parameter tuning for good skin segmentation results.;2019;10.1117/12.2506620
J;Deep Learning Analysis of In Vivo Hyperspectral Images for Automated Intraoperative Nerve Detection;Nerves are critical structures that may be difficult to recognize during surgery. Inadvertent nerve injuries can have catastrophic consequences for the patient and lead to life-long pain and a reduced quality of life. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a non-invasive technique combining photography with spectroscopy, allowing non-invasive intraoperative biological tissue property quantification. We show, for the first time, that HSI combined with deep learning allows nerves and other tissue types to be automatically recognized in in vivo hyperspectral images. An animal model was used, and eight anesthetized pigs underwent neck midline incisions, exposing several structures (nerve, artery, vein, muscle, fat, skin). State-of-the-art machine learning models were trained to recognize these tissue types in HSI data. The best model was a convolutional neural network (CNN), achieving an overall average sensitivity of 0.91 and a specificity of 1.0, validated with leave-one-patient-out cross-validation. For the nerve, the CNN achieved an average sensitivity of 0.76 and a specificity of 0.99. In conclusion, HSI combined with a CNN model is suitable for in vivo nerve recognition.;2021;10.3390/diagnostics11081508
C;A multispectral FLIM tomograph for in vivo imaging of skin cancer;To aid the in vivo diagnosis of skin lesions, we present the design and implementation of a 4 channel FLIM detector and a hyperspectral imaging detector into a clinically licensed commercial two-photon tomograph. We have also implemented image segmentation algorithms to facilitate the automated processing of the large volumes of data produced. The first detector is based on multispectral time correlated single photon counting, providing four channel fluorescence lifetime images. The second detector is a prism-based CCD hyperspectral imager. These detectors provide the capability to extract the relative content and state of autofluorescence compounds present in biological tissue.;2011;10.1117/12.873567
J;Quantitative multispectral ex vivo optical evaluation of human ovarian tissue using spatial frequency domain imaging;"About 85-90% of all ovarian cancers are carcinomas; these manifest clinically as mass-forming epithelial proliferations involving the ovary. In this study, a visible light spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) system was used for multispectral ex vivo imaging and quantitative evaluation of freshly excised benign and malignant human ovarian tissues. A total of 14 ovaries from 11 patients undergoing oophorectomy were investigated. Using a logistic regression model with seven significant spectral and spatial features extracted from SFDI images, a sensitivity of 94.06% and specificity of 93.53% were achieved for prediction of histologically confirmed invasive carcinoma.

J;Spatial and Spectral Characterization of Human Retinal Pigment Epithelium Fluorophore Families by Ex Vivo Hyperspectral Autofluorescence Imaging;Purpose: Discovery of candidate spectra for abundant fluorophore families in human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) by ex vivo hyperspectral imaging. Methods: Hyperspectral autofluorescence emission images were captured between 420 and 720 nm (10-nm intervals), at two excitation bands (436-460, 480-510 nm), from three locations (fovea, perifovea, near-periphery) in 20 normal RPE/Bruch's membrane (BrM) flatmounts. Mathematical factorization extracted a BrM spectrum (S0) and abundant lipofuscin/melanolipofuscin (LF/ML) spectra of RPE origin (S1, S2, S3) from each tissue. Results: Smooth spectra S1 to S3, with perinuclear localization consistent with LF/ML at all three retinal locations and both excitations in 14 eyes (84 datasets), were included in the analysis. The mean peak emissions of S0, S1, and S2 at lambda(ex) 436 nm were, respectively, 495 6 14, 535 6 17, and 576 6 20 nm. S3 was generally trimodal, with peaks at either 580, 620, or 650 nm (peak mode, 650 nm). At lambda(ex) 480 nm, S0, S1, and S2 were red-shifted to 526 6 9, 553 6 10, and 588 6 23 nm, and S3 was again trimodal (peak mode, 620 nm). S1 often split into two spectra, S1A and S1B. S3 strongly colocalized with melanin. There were no significant differences across age, sex, or retinal location. Conclusions: There appear to be at least three families of abundant RPE fluorophores that are ubiquitous across age, retinal location, and sex in this sample of healthy eyes. Further molecular characterization by imaging mass spectrometry and localization via super-resolution microscopy should elucidate normal and abnormal RPE physiology involving fluorophores.;2016;10.1167/tvst.5.3.5
J;Hyperspectral imaging for tissue classification, a way toward smart laparoscopic colorectal surgery;In the last decades, laparoscopic surgery has become the gold standard in patients with colorectal cancer. To overcome the drawback of reduced tactile feedback, real-time tissue classification could be of great benefit. In this ex vivo study, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) was used to distinguish tumor tissue from healthy surrounding tissue. A sample of fat, healthy colorectal wall, and tumor tissue was collected per patient and imaged using two hyperspectral cameras, covering the wavelength range from 400 to 1700 nm. The data were randomly divided into a training (75%) and test (25%) set. After feature reduction, a quadratic classifier and support vector machine were used to distinguish the three tissue types. Tissue samples of 32 patients were imaged using both hyperspectral cameras. The accuracy to distinguish the three tissue types using both hyperspectral cameras was 0.88 (STD = 0.13) on the test dataset. When the accuracy was determined per patient, a mean accuracy of 0.93 (STD = 0.12) was obtained on the test dataset. This study shows the potential of using HSI in colorectal cancer surgery for fast tissue classification, which could improve clinical outcome. Future research should be focused on imaging entire colon/rectum specimen and the translation of the technique to an intraoperative setting. (C) The Authors.

C;Snapshot hyperspectral imaging for detection of breast tumors in resected specimens.;For solid tumors, such as breast cancer, surgery is usually the treatment of choice. For these operations, it is of utmost importance to remove the whole tumor, since tumor-positive resection margins may result in recurrent disease and impaired overall survival. Current optical imaging techniques using endogenous contrast - e.g. diffuse reflectance spectroscopy or optical coherence tomography - for detection of breast cancers are limited to point measurements or long acquisition times. Broadband hyperspectral cameras, which provide a complete spectral fingerprint of the object at pixel level, are needed for two-dimensional imaging of the operative region. An ex vivo study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of hyperspectral imaging for breast cancer detection. Fresh (<3 hours after surgery) resected breast cancer slices were imaged with a snapshot hyperspectral camera, which has 41 spectral bands, equally distributed in the visible and near-infrared (VIS-NIR) range (450 - 950 nm). Supervised analysis was performed by using the pathology annotations and unsupervised analysis was performed by using the hierarchical stochastic neighbour embedding (h-SNE) algorithm. So far, nine resected specimens, of which six invasive carcinomas and two (partially) mucinous carcinomas, were imaged. Spectral differences were found between the non-tumor, malign and benign regions on the resected specimens. Furthermore, automatic feature classification using h-SNE was possible in selected cases. Hyperspectral imaging showed great potential for discrimination of benign and malign breast tissue by using specific wavelengths bands in an ex vivo setting. Further analysis will be performed to determine whether it is possible to select tumor-specific wavelengths.;2019;10.1117/12.2507835
C;Three-dimensional optoacoustic mesoscopy of the tumor heterogeneity in vivo using high depth-to-resolution multispectral optoacoustic tomography;Multispectral optoacoustic mesoscopy (MSOM) has been recently introduced for cancer imaging, it has the potential for high resolution imaging of cancer development in vivo, at depths beyond the diffusion limit. Based on spectral features, optoacoustic imaging is capable of visualizing angiogenesis and imaging cancer heterogeneity of malignant tumors through endogenous hemoglobin. However, high-resolution structural and functional imaging of whole tumor mass is limited by modest penetration and image quality, due to the insufficient capability of ultrasound detectors and the two-dimensional scan geometry. In this study, we introduce a novel multi-spectral optoacoustic mesoscopy (MSOM) for imaging subcutaneous or orthotopic tumors implanted in lab mice, with the high-frequency ultrasound linear array and a conical scanning geometry. Detailed volumetric images of vasculature and oxygen saturation of tissue in the entire tumors are obtained in vivo, at depths up to 10 mm with the desirable spatial resolutions approaching 70 mu m. This unprecedented performance enables the visualization of vasculature morphology and hypoxia conditions has been verified with ex vivo studies. These findings demonstrate the potential of MSOM for preclinical oncological studies in deep solid tumors to facilitate the characterization of tumor's angiogenesis and the evaluation of treatment strategies.;2017;10.1117/12.2253047
C;Validation of two techniques for intraoperative hyperspectral human tissue determination;Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a non-contact optical imaging technique with the potential to serve as an intraoperative computer-aided diagnostic tool. This work analyzes the optical properties of visible structures in the surgical field for automatic tissue categorization. Building an HSI-based computer-aided tissue analysis system requires accurate ground truth and validation of optical soft tissue properties as these show large variability. In this paper, we introduce and validate two different hyperspectral intraoperative imaging setups and their use for the analysis of optical tissue properties. First, we present an improved multispectral filter-wheel setup integrated into a fully digital microscope. Second, we present a novel setup of two hyperspectral snapshot cameras for intraoperative usage. Both setups are operating in the spectral range of 400 nm up to 975 nm. They are calibrated and validated using the same database and calibration set. For validation, a color chart with 18 well-defined color spectra in the visual range is analyzed. Thus, the results acquired with both settings become transferable and comparable to each other as well as between different interventions. Clinical in-vivo data of two different oral and maxillofacial surgical procedures underline the potential of HSI as an intraoperative diagnostic tool and the clinical usability of both setups. Thereby, we demonstrate their feasibility for the in-vivo analysis and differentiation of different human soft tissues.;2019;10.1117/12.2512811
J;Model Based Inversion for Deriving Maps of Histological Parameters Characteristic of Cancer From Ex-Vivo Multispectral Images of the Colon;A model-based inversion method was used to obtain quantitative estimates of histological parameters from multispectral images of the colon and to examine their potential for discriminating between normal and pathological tissues. Pixel-wise estimates of the mucosal blood volume fraction, density of the scattering particles and thickness were derived using a two-stage method. In the first (forward) stage reflectance spectra corresponding to given instances of the parameter values were computed using Monte Carlo simulation of photon propagation through a multi-layered tissue. In the second (inversion) stage the parameter values were obtained via optimization using an iterated conditional modes algorithm based on Discrete Markov Random Fields. The method was validated on computer generated data contaminated with noise giving a mean normalized root mean square deviation (NRMSD) of 2.04. Validation on ex vivo images demonstrated that parametric maps show gross correspondence with histological features of mucosa characteristic of cancerous, precancerous and noncancerous colon lesions. The key signs of abnormality were shown to be the increase in the blood volume fraction and decrease in the density of scattering particles.;2014;10.1109/TMI.2013.2290697
C;Portable multispectral imaging system for oral cancer diagnosis;This study presents the portable multispectral imaging system that can acquire the image of specific spectrum in vivo for oral cancer diagnosis. According to the research literature, the autofluorescence of cells and tissue have been widely applied to diagnose oral cancer. The spectral distribution is difference for lesions of epithelial cells and normal cells after excited fluorescence. We have been developed the hyperspectral and multispectral techniques for oral cancer diagnosis in three generations. This research is the third generation. The excited and emission spectrum for the diagnosis are acquired from the research of first generation. The portable system for detection of oral cancer is modified for existing handheld microscope. The UV LED is used to illuminate the surface of oral cavity and excite the cells to produce fluorescent. The image passes through the central channel and filters out unwanted spectrum by the selection of filter, and focused by the focus lens on the image sensor. Therefore, we can achieve the specific wavelength image via fluorescence reaction. The specificity and sensitivity of the system are 85% and 90%, respectively.;2013;10.1117/12.2023304
C;LED-based Hyperspectral Endoscopic Imaging;Hyperspectral endoscopy can offer multiple advantages as compared to conventional endoscopy. Our goal is to design and develop a real-time hyperspectral endoscopic imaging system for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancers using a micro-LED array as an in-situ illumination source. The wavelengths of the system range from ultraviolet to visible and near infrared. To evaluate the use of the LED array for hyperspectral imaging, we designed a prototype system and conducted ex vivo experiments using normal and cancerous tissues of mice, chicken, and sheep. We compared the results of our LED-based approach with our reference hyperspectral camera system. The results confirm the similarity between the LED-based hyperspectral imaging system and the reference HSI camera. Our LED-based hyperspectral imaging system can be used not only as an endoscope but also as a laparoscopic or handheld devices for cancer detection and surgery.;2022;10.1117/12.2609023
J;Imaging Fourier transform endospectroscopy for in vivo and in situ multispectral imaging;We report the design and implementation of a multispectral imaging Fourier transform endospectroscopy (IFTES) system. The IFTES system employs a flexible fiber bundle catheter coupled to a home-built imaging Fourier transform spectroscope. The instrument enables the performance of non- or minimally invasive subsurface imaging and multispectral imaging at the cellular level in vivo and in situ. A maximum spectral resolution of 0.2 nm at 632.8 nm and a lateral resolution of 4.4 mu m were proved. Preliminary results of a standard resolution target, ex-vivo small animal tissue, single wavelength laser, fluorescence solution, in-vivo mouse skin, microspheres mixture, and in-vivo transgenic mouse brain were given to demonstrate the potential of the technique.

Conclusion: The introduced calibration pipeline for different HSI setups allows comparison between all acquired spectral information. Clinical in vivo data underline the potential of HSI as an intraoperative diagnostic tool and the clinical usability of both introduced setups. Thereby, we demonstrate their feasibility for the in vivo analysis and categorization of different human soft tissues. (C) The Authors.

C;Multispectral imaging fluorescence microscopy for lymphoid tissue analysis;Multispectral imaging autofluorescence microscopy OI (MIAM) is used here for the analysis of lymphatic tissues. Lymph node biopsies, from patients with lymphoadenopaty of different origin have been examined. Natural fluorescence (NF) images of 3 mu m sections were obtained using three filters peaked at 450, 550 and 680 nm with 50 nm bandpass. Monochrome images were combined together in a single RGB image. NF images of lymph node tissue sections show intense blue-green fluorescence of the connective stroma. Normal tissue shows follicles with faintly fluorescent lymphocytes, as expected from the morphologic and functional characteristics of these cells. Other more fluorescent cells (i.e. plasma cells and macrophages) are evidenced. Intense green fluorescence is localized in the inner wall of the vessels. Tissues coming from patients affected by Hodgkin's lymphoma show spread fluorescence due to connective infiltration and no evidence of follicle organization. Brightly fluorescent large cells, presumably Hodgkin cells, are also observed. These results indicate that MIAM can discriminate between normal and pathological tissues on the basis of their natural fluorescence pattern and, therefore, represents a potentially useful technique for diagnostic applications. Analysis of the fluorescence spectra of both normal and malignant lymphoid tissues resulted much less discriminatory than MIAM.;1999;10.1117/12.336938
J;Imaging the Bio-Distribution of Fluorescent Probes Using Multispectral Epi-Illumination Cryoslicing Imaging;The increasing availability of fluorescent probes for in vivo optical imaging enables the interrogation of complex biological processes in small animals serving as models for human-like tissue function and disease. However, the validation of probe bio-distribution during their development or the study of different disease models, in support of in vivo imaging studies, is not straightforward. The imaging system developed consists of a customized multispectral planar imager that has been adapted on a commercial cryomicrotome and provides a powerful modality for ex vivo imaging of small animals. The ability to capture 3D anatomical (color) and fluorescence volumetric distributions of multiple fluorescent markers in high resolution is showcased. Serving both as a method for accurately imaging the bio-distribution of multiple fluorescent agents inside organisms and as a modality for the validation of non-invasive methods, multispectral cryoslicing imaging offers useful insights to ex vivo optical imaging of molecular probes.;2011;10.1007/s11307-010-0416-8
J;In vivo use of hyperspectral imaging to develop a noncontact endoscopic diagnosis support system for malignant colorectal tumors;The early detection and diagnosis of malignant colorectal tumors enables the initiation of early-stage therapy and can significantly increase the survival rate and post-treatment quality of life among cancer patients. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is recognized as a powerful tool for noninvasive cancer detection. In the gastrointestinal field, most of the studies on HSI have involved ex vivo biopsies or resected tissues. In the present study, we aimed to assess the difference in the in vivo spectral reflectance of malignant colorectal tumors and normal mucosa. A total of 21 colorectal tumors or adenomatous polyps from 12 patients at Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital were examined using a flexible hyperspectral (HS) colonoscopy system that can obtain in vivo HS images of the colorectal mucosa. We determined the optimal wavelengths for differentiating tumors from normal tissue based on these recorded images. The application of the determined wavelengths in spectral imaging in clinical trials indicated that such a clinical support system comprising a flexible HS colonoscopy unit and band selection unit is useful for outlining the tumor region and enhancing the display of the mucosa microvascular pattern in vivo.

C;CLASSIFICATION OF EX-VIVO BREAST CANCER POSITIVE MARGINS MEASURED BY HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING;This paper presents our recent development of a classification algorithm for identification of breast cancer margins measured by hyperspectral imaging for the purpose of lowering the number of missed positive margins in breast cancer lumpectomy. After extracting Fourier coefficient selection features and reducing the dimensionality of hyperspectral image data via the Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance method, an SVM classifier involving a radial basis kernel function is deployed to separate cancerous tissues from normal tissues. By examining exvivo breast cancer hyperspectral images tagged by a pathologist, the developed classification approach is shown to achieve a sensitivity of about 98% and a specificity of about 99%.;2013;
C;Wide-field multispectral photoacoustic imaging of human melanomas in vivo;Cutaneous melanoma accounts for only 5% of skin cancer, but it is as dangerous as it is associated with 75% skin-cancer-related deaths. Clinical decision-making and prognosis is the thickness of melanoma into the tissue. Another feature is that the cancer that can occur anywhere on the body, including the face, chest, thigh, soles, and groin, and its size is also very diverse. Here, we developed a hand-held scanner and obtained 3D photoacoustic images of in vivo human melanoma by using multispectral real-time clinical photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging system with the scanner. The scanner allowed wide-field scanning of 3.8 cm (transducer aperture size) x 3 cm (scanning range). Four patients were recruited to obtain photoacoustic melanoma images of various sites (thigh, sole, etc.), types ( in situ, invasive, etc.) and sizes (sub-mm to cm). Five wavelengths were used to perform spectral unmixing. The penetration depth of melanoma was successfully confirmed by the multispectral photoacoustic images. The melanoma depth measured by photoacoustic imaging was significantly similar to histopathologic results obtained after excision (mean absolute error = 0.6 mm). In this study, we acquired small-to-large size and various types of melanoma multispectral photoacoustic images in vivo. We hope that this study will be an additional criterion for histopathological results that may have a positive impact on the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of melanomas.;2020;10.1117/12.2543652
J;In vivo cytometry: A spectrum of possibilites;"Background: We investigate whether optical imaging can reliably detect abnormalities in tissue, in a range of specimens (live cells in vitro; fixed, fresh ex-vivo and in Vivo tissue), without the use of added contrast agents, and review our promising spectral methods for achieving quantitative, real-time, high resolution intrasurgical optical diagnostics. Methods: We use reflectance, fluorescence, two-photon, and Mic scattering imaging, performed with instrumentation we developed or modified, to detect intrinsic tissue signatures. Emphasis is on spectral/hyperspectral imaging approaches allowing the equivalent of in vivo pathology. Results: With experimental focus on unstained specimens, we demonstrate the ability to segment tissue images for cancer detection. Spectral reflectance imaging, Coupled with advanced analysis, typically yields 90% specificity and sensitivity. Autofluorescence is also shown to be diagnostically useful, with lymph nodes results highlighted here. Elastic scattering hyperspectral imaging endoscopy, using a new instrument we designed and built, shows promise in bronchoscopic detection of dysplasia and early cancer in patients. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that advanced optical imaging can detect and localize cellular signatures of cancer in real-time, in vivo, without the use of contrast agents, in animals and humans. This is an important step towards tight spatio-temporal coupling between such detection and clinical intervention. (c) 2006 international Society for Analytical Cytology.";2006;10.1002/cyto.a.20220
J;Hyperspectral Imaging for Tissue Classification after Advanced Stage Ovarian Cancer Surgery-A Pilot Study;Simple Summary Survival of ovarian cancer patients largely relies on the surgical removal of all cancer cells. To achieve this, good vision is crucial. In this study, we evaluate the ability of hyperspectral imaging to detect ovarian cancer. Images of surgically removed tissue samples of 11 patients were taken and compared to histopathology in order to train machine learning software. For training purposes, only healthy tissues and tissues with high tumor cell content (>50%) were included. In total, 26 tissue samples and 26,446 data points of 10 patients were included. Tissue classification as either tumorous or healthy was evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation. This resulted in a power of 0.83, a sensitivity of 0.81, a specificity of 0.70 and a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.41. To conclude, this study shows that hyperspectral imaging can be used to recognize ovarian cancer. In the future, the technique may enable real-time image guidance during surgery. The most important prognostic factor for the survival of advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the completeness of cytoreductive surgery (CRS). Therefore, an intraoperative technique to detect microscopic tumors would be of great value. The aim of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for EOC detection in ex vivo tissue samples. Images were collected during CRS in 11 patients in the wavelength range of 665-975 nm, and processed by calibration, normalization, and noise filtering. A linear support vector machine (SVM) was employed to classify healthy and tumorous tissue (defined as >50% tumor cells). Classifier performance was evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Images of 26 tissue samples from 10 patients were included, containing 26,446 data points that were matched to histopathology. Tumorous tissue could be classified with an area under the curve of 0.83, a sensitivity of 0.81, a specificity of 0.70, and Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.41. This study paves the way to in vivo and intraoperative use of HSI during CRS. Hyperspectral imaging can scan a whole tissue surface in a fast and non-contact way. Our pilot study demonstrates that HSI and SVM learning can be used to discriminate EOC from surrounding tissue.;2022;10.3390/cancers14061422
C;Spatio-spectral deep learning methods for in-vivo hyperspectral laryngeal cancer detection;Early detection of head and neck tumors is crucial for patient survival. Often, diagnoses are made based on endoscopic examination of the larynx followed by biopsy and histological analysis, leading to a high interobserver variability due to subjective assessment. In this regard, early non-invasive diagnostics independent of the clinician would be a valuable tool. A recent study has shown that hyperspectral imaging (HSI) can be used for non-invasive detection of head and neck tumors, as precancerous or cancerous lesions show specific spectral signatures that distinguish them from healthy tissue. However, HSI data processing is challenging due to high spectral variations, various image interferences, and the high dimensionality of the data. Therefore, performance of automatic HSI analysis has been limited and so far, mostly ex-vivo studies have been presented with deep learning. In this work, we analyze deep learning techniques for in-vivo hyperspectral laryngeal cancer detection. For this purpose we design and evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with 2D spatial or 3D spatiospectral convolutions combined with a state-of-the-art Densenet architecture. For evaluation, we use an in-vivo data set with HSI of the oral cavity or oropharynx. Overall, we present multiple deep learning techniques for in-vivo laryngeal cancer detection based on HSI and we show that jointly learning from the spatial and spectral domain improves classification accuracy notably. Our 3D spatio-spectral Densenet achieves an average accuracy of 81%.;2020;10.1117/12.2549251
J;Multispectral tissue characterization for intestinal anastomosis optimization;Intestinal anastomosis is a surgical procedure that restores bowel continuity after surgical resection to treat intestinal malignancy, inflammation, or obstruction. Despite the routine nature of intestinal anastomosis procedures, the rate of complications is high. Standard visual inspection cannot distinguish the tissue subsurface and small changes in spectral characteristics of the tissue, so existing tissue anastomosis techniques that rely on human vision to guide suturing could lead to problems such as bleeding and leakage from suturing sites. We present a proof-of-concept study using a portable multispectral imaging (MSI) platform for tissue characterization and preoperative surgical planning in intestinal anastomosis. The platform is composed of a fiber ring light-guided MSI system coupled with polarizers and image analysis software. The system is tested on ex vivo porcine intestine tissue, and we demonstrate the feasibility of identifying optimal regions for suture placement. (C) The Authors.

C;Hyperspectral Imaging for Cancer Surgical Margin Delineation: Registration of Hyperspectral and Histological Images;The determination of tumor margins during surgical resection remains a challenging task. A complete removal of malignant tissue and conservation of healthy tissue is important for the preservation of organ function, patient satisfaction, and quality of life. Visual inspection and palpation is not sufficient for discriminating between malignant and normal tissue types. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology has the potential to noninvasively delineate surgical tumor margin and can be used as an intra-operative visual aid tool. Since histological images provide the ground truth of cancer margins, it is necessary to warp the cancer regions in ex vivo histological images back to in vivo hyperspectral images in order to validate the tumor margins detected by HSI and to optimize the imaging parameters. In this paper, principal component analysis (PCA) is utilized to extract the principle component bands of the HSI images, which is then used to register HSI images with the corresponding histological image. Affine registration is chosen to model the global transformation. A B-spline free form deformation (FFD) method is used to model the local non-rigid deformation. Registration experiment was performed on animal hyperspectral and histological images. Experimental results from animals demonstrated the feasibility of the hyperspectral imaging method for cancer margin detection.;2014;10.1117/12.2043805
J;Automatic cancer tissue detection using multispectral photoacoustic imaging;Purpose In the case of multispecimen study to locate cancer regions, such as in thyroidectomy and prostatectomy, a significant labor-intensive processing is required at a high cost. Pathology diagnosis is usually done by a pathologist observing tissue-stained glass slide under a microscope. Method Multispectral photoacoustic (MPA) specimen imaging has proven successful in differentiating photoacoustic (PA) signal characteristics between a histopathology-defined cancer region and normal tissue. This is mainly due to its ability to efficiently map oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin contents from MPA images and key features for cancer detection. A fully automated deep learning algorithm is purposed, which learns to detect the presence of malignant tissue in freshly excised ex vivo human thyroid and prostate tissue specimens using the three-dimensional MPA dataset. The proposed automated deep learning model consisted of the convolutional neural network architecture, which extracts spatially colocated features, and a softmax function, which detects thyroid and prostate cancer tissue at once. This is one of the first deep learning models, to the best of our knowledge, to detect the presence of cancer in excised thyroid and prostate tissue of humans at once based on PA imaging. Result The area under the curve (AUC) was used as a metric to evaluate the predictive performance of the classifier. The proposed model detected the cancer tissue with the AUC of 0.96, which is very promising. Conclusion This model is an improvement over the previous work using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. This model may have immediate application in cancer screening of the numerous sliced specimens that result from thyroidectomy and prostatectomy. Since the instrument that was used to capture the ex vivo PA images is now being developed for in vivo use, this model may also prove to be a starting point for in vivo PA image analysis for cancer diagnosis.;2020;10.1007/s11548-019-02101-1
J;Perspectives, potentials and trends of ex vivo and in vivo optical molecular pathology;It is pivotal for medical applications, such as noninvasive histopathologic characterization of tissue, to realize label-free and molecule-specific representation of morphologic and biochemical composition in real-time with subcellular spatial resolution. This unmet clinical need requires new approaches for rapid and reliable real-time assessment of pathologies to complement established diagnostic tools. Photonic imaging combined with digitalization offers the potential to provide the clinician the requested information both under in vivo and ex vivo conditions. This report summarizes photonic approaches and their use in combination with image processing, machine learning and augmented virtual reality that might solve current challenges in modern medicine. Details are given for pathology, intraoperative diagnosis in head and neck cancer and endoscopic diagnosis in gastroenterology.;2018;10.1002/jbio.201700236
J;Mapping 2D-and 3D-distributions of metal/metal oxide nanoparticles within cleared human ex vivo skin tissues;Increasing numbers of commercial skincare products are being manufactured with engineered nanomaterials (ENMs), prompting a need to fully understand how ENMs interact with the dermal barrier as a major biodistribution entry route. Although animal studies show that certain nanomaterials can cross the skin barrier, physiological differences between human and animal skin, such as the lack of sweat glands, limit the translational validity of these results. Current optical microscopy methods have limited capabilities to visualize ENMs within human skin tissues due to the high amount of background light scattering caused by the dense, ubiquitous extracellular matrix (ECM) of the skin. Here, we hypothesized that organic solvent-based tissue clearing (immunolabeling-enabled three-dimensional imaging of solvent-cleared organs, or iDISCO) would reduce background light scattering from the extracellular matrix of the skin to sufficiently improve imaging contrast for both 2D mapping of unlabeled metal oxide ENMs and 3D mapping of fluorescent nanoparticles. We successfully mapped the 2D distribution of label-free TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles in cleared skin sections using correlated signals from darkfield, brightfield, and confocal microscopy, as well as micro-spectroscopy. Specifically, hyperspectral microscopy and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the identity of label-free ENMs which we mapped within human skin sections. We also measured the 3D distribution of fluorescently labeled Ag nanoparticles in cleared skin biopsies with wounded epidermal layers using light sheet fluorescence microscopy. Overall, this study explores a novel strategy for quantitatively mapping ENM distributions in cleared ex vivo human skin tissue models using multiple imaging modalities. By improving the imaging contrast, we present label-free 2D ENM tracking and 3D ENM mapping as promising capabilities for nanotoxicology investigations.;2020;10.1016/j.impact.2020.100208
J;Multidimensional custom-made non-linear microscope: from ex-vivo to in-vivo imaging;We have built a custom-made multidimensional non-linear microscope equipped with a combination of several non-linear laser imaging techniques involving fluorescence lifetime, multispectral two-photon and second-harmonic generation imaging. The optical system was mounted on a vertical honeycomb breadboard in an upright configuration, using two galvo-mirrors relayed by two spherical mirrors as scanners. A double detection system working in non-descanning mode has allowed both photon counting and a proportional regime. This experimental setup offering high spatial (micrometric) and temporal (sub-nanosecond) resolution has been used to image both ex-vivo and in-vivo biological samples, including cells, tissues, and living animals. Multidimensional imaging was used to spectroscopically characterize human skin lesions, as malignant melanoma and naevi. Moreover, two-color detection of two photon excited fluorescence was applied to in-vivo imaging of living mice intact neocortex, as well as to induce neuronal microlesions by femtosecond laser burning. The presented applications demonstrate the capability of the instrument to be used in a wide range of biological and biomedical studies.;2008;10.1007/s00340-008-3130-3
J;Light source calibration for multispectral imaging in surgery;Purpose Live intra-operative functional imaging has multiple potential clinical applications, such as localization of ischemia, assessment of organ transplantation success and perfusion monitoring. Recent research has shown that live monitoring of functional tissue properties, such as tissue oxygenation and blood volume fraction, is possible using multispectral imaging in laparoscopic surgery. While the illuminant spectrum is typically kept constant in laparoscopic surgery and can thus be estimated from preoperative calibration images, a key challenge in open surgery originates from the dynamic changes of lighting conditions. Methods The present paper addresses this challenge with a novel approach to light source calibration based on specular highlight analysis. It involves the acquisition of low-exposure time images serving as a basis for recovering the illuminant spectrum from pixels that contain a dominant specular reflectance component. Results Comprehensive in silico and in vivo experiments with a range of different light sources demonstrate that our approach enables an accurate and robust recovery of the illuminant spectrum in the field of view of the camera, which results in reduced errors with respect to the estimation of functional tissue properties. Our approach further outperforms state-of-the-art methods proposed in the field of computer vision. Conclusion Our results suggest that low-exposure multispectral images are well suited for light source calibration via specular highlight analysis. This work thus provides an important first step toward live functional imaging in open surgery.;2020;10.1007/s11548-020-02195-y
J;Tissue characterization utilizing hyperspectral imaging for liver thermal ablation;"Background: Thermal ablation is the dominant modality to treat liver tumors for patients who are not surgical candidates. However, correctly predicting the volume of the subsequent tissue destruction during the Thermal Ablation technique is a difficult undertaking. Objective: To examine the impacts of ablation zone volume following Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of an exvivo bovine liver to correlate the impacts of thermal ablation with target organ perfusion; by exploiting the unique properties of Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI). Materials and methods: Radiofrequency ablation was perfused on ex-vivo bovine livers at peripheral and central-vessel-adjacent locations, and monitored by HSI with a spectral range from 400 to 1000 nm. The system contains k-means clustering (K = 8) algorithms combining spectral and spatial information. Labeled spectral signatures datasets were used as training data. Statistical analysis (10 samples) was computed to calculate the highest variance between six spectral images for determining the optimum wavelength for discrimination between the affected regions after thermal ablation (normal, thermal, and ablated liver tissue regions). Results: The change of the optical properties of ex-vivo liver tissues provides different responses to light transmission, scattering, absorption and particularly the reflection over the spectrum range. The produced spectral image from reflection with the highest variance (358.07) empowered us to determine the optimum wavelength spectral image (720 +/- 18.92 nm) to distinguish between the normal, ablated, and thermal categories. Conclusion: Hyperspectral imaging is a powerful tool in monitoring tissue characterization, which is a useful technique for edge evaluation of liver thermal ablation..";2020;10.1016/j.pdpdt.2020.101899
J;In-Vivo Hyperspectral Human Brain Image Database for Brain Cancer Detection;The use of hyperspectral imaging for medical applications is becoming more common in recent years. One of the main obstacles that researchers find when developing hyperspectral algorithms for medical applications is the lack of specific, publicly available, and hyperspectral medical data. The work described in this paper was developed within the framework of the European project HELICoiD (HypErspectraL Imaging Cancer Detection), which had as a main goal the application of hyperspectral imaging to the delineation of brain tumors in real-time during neurosurgical operations. In this paper, the methodology followed to generate the first hyperspectral database of in-vivo human brain tissues is presented. Data was acquired employing a customized hyperspectral acquisition system capable of capturing information in the Visual and Near InfraRed (VNIR) range from 400 to 1000 nm. Repeatability was assessed for the cases where two images of the same scene were captured consecutively. The analysis reveals that the system works more efficiently in the spectral range between 450 and 900 nm. A total of 36 hyperspectral images from 22 different patients were obtained. From these data, more than 300 000 spectral signatures were labeled employing a semi-automatic methodology based on the spectral angle mapper algorithm. Four different classes were defined: normal tissue, tumor tissue, blood vessel, and background elements. All the hyperspectral data has been made available in a public repository.;2019;10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2904788
J;Interventional multispectral photoacoustic imaging with a clinical ultrasound probe for discriminating nerves and tendons: an ex vivo pilot study;Accurate and efficient identification of nerves is an essential component of peripheral nerve blocks. While ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used as a guidance modality, it often provides insufficient contrast for identifying nerves from surrounding tissues such as tendons. Electrical nerve stimulators can be used in conjunction with US imaging for discriminating nerves from surrounding tissues, but they are insufficient to reliably prevent neural punctures, so that alternative methods are highly desirable. In this study, an interventional multispectral photoacoustic (PA) imaging system was used to directly compare the signal amplitudes and spectra acquired from nerves and tendons ex vivo, for the first time. The results indicate that the system can provide significantly higher image contrast for discriminating nerves and tendons than that provided by US imaging. As such, photoacoustic imaging could be valuable as an adjunct to US for guiding peripheral nerve blocks.

C;Multispectral multiphoton lifetime analysis of human bladder tissue;"Human tissues intrinsically contain many fluorophores, as such NADH, elastin, collagen, and flavins, that can be excited and imaged using multiphoton microscopy, up to 150 mu m depth. In this work we have used combined two-photon excited fluorescence (TPE), fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and multispectral two photon emission detection (MTPE) to investigate different kinds of human ex-vivo fresh biopsies of bladder. Morphological and spectroscopic analyses have allowed to characterize both healthy and pathological tissue samples. In particular, we have examined tissue samples from healthy bladder mucosa, and bladder carcinoma in-situ (CIS), finding both morphological and spectroscopic differences. From the morphological point of view, cancer cells appeared more elongated with respect to corresponding normal cells; they also exhibited a different nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. From the spectroscopic point of view, we have found differences between the two tissue types in both spectral emission and fluorescence lifetime distribution. Even if further analysis, as well as a more significant statistics on a large number of samples would be helpful to discriminate between low and high grade cancer, our method is a promising tool to be used as diagnostic confirmation of histological results, as well as a diagnostic tool in a multiphoton endoscope or cystoscope to be used in in-vivo imaging applications.";2009;10.1117/12.808240
C;High-speed multispectral confocal imaging;A new approach for generating high-speed multispectral images has been developed. The central concept is that spectra can be acquired for each pixel in a confocal spatial scan by using a fast spectrometer based on optical fiber delay lines. This concept merges fast spectroscopy with standard spatial scanning to create datacubes in real time. The spectrometer is based on a serial array of reflecting spectral elements, delay lines between these elements, and a single element detector. The spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution of the instrument is described, and illustrated by multispectral images of laser-induced autofluorescence in biological tissues.;2013;10.1117/12.2001883
C;In-vivo morphologic and spectroscopic investigation of Psoriasis;Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease of the skin characterized by hyperkeratosis, hyperproliferation of the epidermis, inflammatory cell accumulation and increased dilatation of dermal papillary blood vessels. Cases of psoriasis were investigated in vivo with optical means in order to evaluate the potential of in vivo optical biopsy. A Polarization Multispectral Dermoscope was employed for the macroscopic observation. Features such as the 'dotted' blood vessels pattern was observed with high contrast. High resolution image sections of the epidermis and the dermis were produced with a custom made Multiphoton Microscope. Imaging extended from the surface of the lesion down to the papillary dermis, at a depth of 200 mu m. In the epidermis, a characteristic morphology of the stratum corneum found only in Psoriasis was revealed. Additionally, the cytoplasmic area of the cells in the stratum spinosum layer was found to be smaller than normal. In the dermis the morphological features were more pronounced, where the elongated dermal papillae dominated the papillary layer. Their length exceeds 100 mu m, which is a far greater value compared to that of healthy skin. These in vivo observations are consistent with the ex vivo histopathological observations, supporting both the applicability and potentiality of multispectral dermoscopy and multiphoton microscopy in the field of in vivo optical investigation and biopsy of skin.;2011;10.1117/12.889346
C;Polarization-sensitive multispectral tissue characterization for optimizing intestinal anastomosis;A novel imaging system that recommends potential suture placement for anastomosis to surgeons is developed. This is achieved by a multispectral imaging system coupled with polarizers and image analysis software. We performed preliminary imaging of ex vivo porcine intestine to evaluate the system. Vulnerable tissue regions including blood vessels were successfully identified and segmented. Thickness of different tissue areas is visualized. Strategies towards optimal points for suture placements have been discussed. Preliminary data suggest our imaging platform and analysis algorithm may be useful in avoiding blood vessels, identifying optimal regions for suture placements to perform safer operations in possibly reduced time.;2014;10.1117/12.2043693
C;In-vivo microvasculature visualization using hyperspectral imaging;"We describe a new noninvasive microscopic near infrared reflectance hyperspectral imaging method for visualizing, in vivo, spatially distributed contributions of oxyhemoglobin perfusing the microvasculature within dermal tissue. Microscopic images of the dermis are acquired, generating a series of spectroscopic images formatted as a function of wavelength consisting of one spectral and two spatial dimensions; a hyperspectral image data cube. The data thus collected can be considered as a series of spatially resolved spectra. For data collection, images are acquired by a system consisting of a near infrared liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF) and a Focal plane array detector (FPA) integrated with a microscope. The LCTF is continuously tunable over a useful near infrared spectral range (650-950 nm) with an average full width at half-height bandwidth of 6.78 nm. To provide high quantum efficiency without etaloning we utilized a back-illumination FPA with deep-depletion technology. A 30W halogen light source illuminates a dermal tissue area of approximately 18 mm in diameter. Reflected light from the dermal tissue is first passed through the microscope, the LCTF, and then imaged onto the FPA. The acquired hyperspectral data is deconvoluted using a multivariate least squares approach that requires at least two reference spectra, oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin. The resulting images are gray scale encoded to directly represent the varying spatial distributions of oxyhemoglobin contribution. As a proof of principle example, we examined a clinical model of vascular occlusion and reperfusion.";2006;10.1117/12.646845
J;A Multimodal Biomicroscopic System based on High-frequency Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse and Multispectral Imaging Techniques for Tumor Characterization Ex vivo;We report a multimodal biomicroscopic system which offers high-frequency ultrasound B-mode, acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI), and multispectral imaging for qualitative tumor characterization ex vivo. Examinations of resected tissues from diseased regions such as tumors are crucial procedures during surgical operations to treat cancer. Particularly, if tiny tumors remain at surgical sites after tumor resection, such tumors can result in unwanted outcomes, such as cancer recurrence or metastasis to other organs. To avoid this, accurate characterizations of tumors resected during surgery are necessary. To this end, we devised a multimodal biomicroscopic system including high-frequency ultrasound B-mode, ARFI, and multispectral imaging modalities to examine resected tumors with high levels of accuracy. This system was evaluated with tissue-mimicking phantoms with different mechanical properties. In addition, colorectal tumors excised from cancer patients were examined. The proposed system offers highly resolved anatomical, mechanical, chemical information pertaining to tumors, thus allowing the detection of tumor regions from the surface to deep inside tissues. These results therefore suggest that the multimodal biomicroscopic system has the potential to undertake qualitative characterizations of excised tumors ex vivo.;2017;10.1038/s41598-017-17367-1
J;Deep Learning-Based Framework for In Vivo Identification of Glioblastoma Tumor using Hyperspectral Images of Human Brain;The main goal of brain cancer surgery is to perform an accurate resection of the tumor, preserving as much normal brain tissue as possible for the patient. The development of a non-contact and label-free method to provide reliable support for tumor resection in real-time during neurosurgical procedures is a current clinical need. Hyperspectral imaging is a non-contact, non-ionizing, and label-free imaging modality that can assist surgeons during this challenging task without using any contrast agent. In this work, we present a deep learning-based framework for processing hyperspectral images of in vivo human brain tissue. The proposed framework was evaluated by our human image database, which includes 26 in vivo hyperspectral cubes from 16 different patients, among which 258,810 pixels were labeled. The proposed framework is able to generate a thematic map where the parenchymal area of the brain is delineated and the location of the tumor is identified, providing guidance to the operating surgeon for a successful and precise tumor resection. The deep learning pipeline achieves an overall accuracy of 80% for multiclass classification, improving the results obtained with traditional support vector machine (SVM)-based approaches. In addition, an aid visualization system is presented, where the final thematic map can be adjusted by the operating surgeon to find the optimal classification threshold for the current situation during the surgical procedure.;2019;10.3390/s19040920
C;Multispectral endoscopy and microscopy imaging using a spectrally programmable light engine;We report a spectrally and temporally programmable light engine based on a spatial light modulator that can dynamically create any narrow or broadband spectral profile for hyperspectral, fluorescence, or principal component imaging. Most hyperspectral or multispectral imaging systems use wavelength selection devices such as acousto-optic tunable filters (AOTFs), tunable grating or prism-based monochromators, or filter wheels. While these devices can select wavelengths they cannot create arbitrary spectral profiles. This simple and economical system can be controlled at high speed (up to 5000 illumination profiles per second). Digitally controlled illumination is bit additive with image data providing high dynamic range imaging with monochrome or color imaging devices. This is especially advantageous for endoscopes employing small well CCD or CMOS sensors since the dynamic range now can extend beyond the limits of the sensor itself. In this report we show multispectral images of in vivo tissue and in vitro tissue samples using endoscopes, surgical microscopes and conventional microscopes.;2005;10.1117/12.613989
C;Hyperspectral fluorescence imaging with multi wavelength LED excitation;Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) can combine morphological and molecular information, yielding potential for real-time and high throughput multiplexed fluorescent contrast agent imaging. Multiplexed readout from targets, such as cell surface receptors overexpressed in cancer cells, could improve both sensitivity and specificity of tumor identification. There remains, however, a need for compact and cost effective implementations of the technology. We have implemented a low-cost wide-field multiplexed fluorescence imaging system, which combines LED excitation at 590, 655 and 740 nm with a compact commercial solid state HSI system operating in the range 600 - 1000 nm. A key challenge for using reflectance-based HSI is the separation of contrast agent fluorescence from the reflectance of the excitation light. Here, we illustrate how it is possible to address this challenge in software, using two offline reflectance removal methods, prior to least-squares spectral unmixing. We made a quantitative comparison of the methods using data acquired from dilutions of contrast agents prepared in well-plates. We then established the capability of our HSI system for non-invasive in vivo fluorescence imaging in small animals using the optimal reflectance removal method. The HSI presented here enables quantitative unmixing of at least four fluorescent contrast agents (Alexa Fluor 610, 647, 700 and 750) simultaneously in living mice. A successful unmixing of the four fluorescent contrast agents was possible both using the pure contrast agents and with mixtures. The system could in principle also be applied to imaging of ex vivo tissue or intraoperative imaging in a clinical setting. These data suggest a promising approach for developing clinical applications of HSI based on multiplexed fluorescence contrast agent imaging.;2016;10.1117/12.2210855
J;Multispectral characterization of tissues encountered during laparoscopic colorectal surgery;"Aims: This study investigated the feasibility of automated differentiation between essential tissue types encountered during laparoscopic colorectal surgery using spectral analysis. Methods: Wide band (440-1830 nm) spectra were collected using an optical fiber probe and spectrometer from freshly explanted, ex vivo, human colonic specimens. These data were normalized at 810 nm (an isobestic wavelength for hemoglobin and oxy-hemoglobin) and mathematically analyzed using total principal component regression (TPCR). Results: 929 spectra were collected from specimens of 19 patients, distinguishing 5 tissue types: mesenteric fat (MF, n=269), blood vessels (BV, n=377), colonic tissue (CT, n=213), ureter (UR, n=10) and tumorous tissue in colon (TT, n=60). For each individual tissue type the distinctive ability was determined against all other tissue types pooled as a group. Paired probability density function (PDF) of tissue (centered around label 1) versus all other pooled tissues (centered around label 0) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) at label crossover value 0.5 was determined for each tissue type (MF: CDF = 0.99 [SD = 0.19]; BV: CDF = 0.95 [SD = 0.29]; CT: CDF= 0.98 [SD = 0.22]; UR: CDF= 0.99 [SD = 0.091; TT: CDF= 0.99 [SD = 0.18]). Conclusion: Automated spectral differentiation of blood vessel, ureter, mesenteric adipose tissue, colonic tissue and tumorous tissue in colon, is feasible in freshly explanted human colonic specimens. These results may be exploited for further steps toward multi- or hyperspectrally enhanced in vivo (laparoscopic) surgical imaging. 2013 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J;Intraoperative using of artificial intelligence and hyperspectral imaging in colorectal surgeries;Background Colorectal cancer is the most common type of cancer worldwide. New methods of precision surgery as well as early detection of neoplastic tissue in colonoscopy play a crucial role in improving the prognosis of this common entity. Artificial intelligence (AI) and innovative, noninvasive, contactless imaging methods are required to further optimize the diagnostics and treatment. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is ideal for this. It enables the chemical tissue properties to be analyzed based on the interactions of light with the tissue types to be examined. Objective Using HSI valuable intraoperative information can be obtained in order to make colorectal interventions more efficient and safer through tissue analyses (e.g. differentiation of pathological and normal tissue, depiction of the nerve plexus in the true pelvis as well as the ureter). In order to make a better interpretation of this hyperspectral information, current methods of AI are used. In this article, the latest intraoperative methods in the context of colorectal resection are presented and critically discussed. Material and method For this purpose, a summary of current work on the combination of HSI with AI methods is presented. These studies deal with the intraoperative tissue classification of neoplastic vs. non-neoplastic lesions and the identification of risk structures in colorectal surgery. Results In more recent papers, a successful differentiation of colorectal carcinomas from dysplastic and normal mucosa as well as the recognition of risk structures with an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of >90% could be achieved. These involve in vivo and ex vivo studies using various AI algorithms. Conclusion Initial studies showed the versatile possibilities of HSI in combination with AI in colorectal surgery. In future studies, based on larger amounts of data, the practicability, stability and accuracy of the AI methods will be further investigated. In addition, HSI technology must be further developed and also implemented in endoscopic diagnostics in order to use its great potential not only in colorectal resection but also in colonoscopy for many other patients.;2022;10.1007/s00053-022-00592-2
J;Medical hyperspectral imaging: a review;Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an emerging imaging modality for medical applications, especially in disease diagnosis and image-guided surgery. HSI acquires a three-dimensional dataset called hypercube, with two spatial dimensions and one spectral dimension. Spatially resolved spectral imaging obtained by HSI provides diagnostic information about the tissue physiology, morphology, and composition. This review paper presents an overview of the literature on medical hyperspectral imaging technology and its applications. The aim of the survey is threefold: an introduction for those new to the field, an overview for those working in the field, and a reference for those searching for literature on a specific application.

J;Noninvasive and Highly Multiplexed Five-Color Tumor Imaging of Multicore Near-Infrared Resonant Surface-Enhanced Raman Nanoparticles In Vivo;In vivo multiplexed imaging aims for noninvasive monitoring of tumors with multiple channels without excision of the tissue. While most of the preclinical imaging has provided a number of multiplexing channels up to three, Raman imaging with surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoparticles was suggested to offer higher multiplexing capability originating from their narrow spectral width. However, in vivo multiplexed SERS imaging is still in its infancy for multichannel visualization of tumors, which require both sufficient multiplicity and high sensitivity concurrently. Here we create multispectral palettes of gold multicore-near-infrared (NIR) resonant Raman dyes-silica shell SERS (NIR-SERRS) nanoparticle oligomers and demonstrate noninvasive and five-plex SERS imaging of the nanoparticle accumulation in tumors of living mice. We perform the five-plex ratiometric imaging of tumors by varying the administered ratio of the nanoparticles, which simulates the detection of multiple biomarkers with different expression levels in the tumor environment. Furthermore, since this method does not require the excision of tumor tissues at the imaging condition, we perform noninvasive and longitudinal imaging of the five-color nanoparticles in the tumors, which is not feasible with current ex vivo multiplexed tissue analysis platforms. Our work surpasses the multiplicity limit of previous preclinical tumor imaging methods while keeping enough sensitivity for tumor-targeted in vivo imaging and could enable the noninvasive assessment of multiple biological targets within the tumor microenvironment in living subjects.;2021;10.1021/acsnano.1c07470
J;Quantitative short-wave infrared multispectral imaging of in vivo tissue optical properties;Extending the wavelength range of spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) into the short-wave infrared (SWIR) has the potential to provide enhanced sensitivity to chromophores such as water and lipids that have prominent absorption features in the SWIR region. Here, we present, for the first time, a method combining SFDI with unstructured (zero spatial frequency) illumination to extract tissue absorption and scattering properties over a wavelength range (850 to 1800 nm) largely unexplored by previous tissue optics techniques. To obtain images over this wavelength range, we employ a SWIR camera in conjunction with an SFDI system. We use SFDI to obtain in vivo tissue reduced scattering coefficients at the wavelengths from 850 to 1050 nm, and then use unstructured wide-field illumination and an extrapolated power-law fit to this scattering spectrum to extract the absorption spectrum from 850 to 1800 nm. Our proof-of-principle experiment in a rat burn model illustrates that the combination of multispectral SWIR imaging, SFDI, and unstructured illumination can characterize in vivo changes in skin optical properties over a greatly expanded wavelength range. In the rat burn experiment, these changes (relative to normal, unburned skin) included increased absorption and increased scattering amplitude and slope, consistent with changes that we previously reported in the near-infrared using SFDI.

J;Rapid, label-free detection of cerebral ischemia in rats using hyperspectral imaging;Background: Stroke is the third most common cause of disability and the second most common cause of death worldwide. Ischemia, one of the two broad categories of stroke, is characterized by a lack of sufficient amounts of blood in order to supply an adequate amount of oxygen and nutrients. It is important to assess the part of the brain that becomes ischemic and necrotic during neurosurgery or experiments in real time. However, there is currently no effective means to achieve this goal. New method: We proposed a method based on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for the real-time detection of a varied range of ischemic brain tissues in vivo or ex vivo and assessed the practical utility of a model of ischemic stroke in rats. Results: The results showed that hyperspectral images processed with a ratio of spectral reflectance at 545 and 560 nm (R545/R560) could identify early brain ischemia and accurately show regions of ischemia. Comparison with existing methods: We verified the area imaged by HSI using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining methods. This technique could precisely image the ischemic part of the brain in vivo and ex vivo. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the practical utility of HSI for the real-time detection of cerebral ischemia in rats. By providing rapid assessment of brain tissue perfusion, HSI may help doctors recognize ischemic regions quickly and precisely during surgery as well as have great utility in the experimental process.;2020;10.1016/j.jneumeth.2019.108466
J;Hyperspectral imaging of mucosal surfaces in patients;The aim of this study was to proof applicability of hyperspectral imaging for the analysis and classification of human mucosal surfaces in vivo. The larynx as a prototypical anatomically well-defined surgical test area was analyzed by microlaryngoscopy with a polychromatic lightsource and a synchronous triggered monochromatic CCD-camera. Image stacks (5 benign, 7 malignant tumors) were analyzed by established software (principal component analysis PCA, hyperspectral classification, spectral profiles). Hyperspectral image datacubes were analyzed and classified by conventional software. In PCA, images at 590-680 nm loaded most onto the first PC which typically contained 95% of the total information. Hyperspectral classification clustered the data highlighting altered mucosa. The spectral profiles clearly differed between the different groups. Hyperspectral imaging can be applied to mucosal surfaces. This approach opens the way to analyze spectral characteristics of histologically different lesions in order to build up a spectral library and to allow non-touch optical biopsy.

J;How Stealthy are PEG-PLA Nanoparticles? An NIR In Vivo Study Combined with Detailed Size Measurements;"Detailed in vivo and ex vivo analysis of nanoparticle distribution, accumulation and elimination processes were combined with comprehensive particle size characterizations. The in vivo fate of near infrared (NIR) nanoparticles in nude mice was carried out using the Maestro (TM) in vivo fluorescence imaging system. Asymmetrical field flow field fractionation (AF4) coupled with multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS), photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed for detailed in vitro characterization. PEG-PLA block polymers were synthesized and used for the production of defined, stable, nontoxic nanoparticles. Nanoparticle analysis revealed narrow size distribution; AF4/MALLS permitted further accurate size evaluation. Multispectral fluorescence imaging made it possible to follow the in vivo fate non-invasively even in deep tissues over several days. Detailed fluorescence ex vivo imaging studies were performed and allowed to establish a calculation method to compare nanoparticle batches with varying fluorescence intensities. We combined narrow-size distributed nanoparticle batches with detailed in vitro characterization and the understanding of their in vivo fate using fluorescence imaging, confirming the wide possibilities of the non-invasive technique and presenting the basis to evaluate future size-dependent passive tumor accumulation studies.";2011;10.1007/s11095-011-0426-5
J;Effects of multispectral excitation on the sensitivity of molecular optoacoustic imaging;Molecular optoacoustic (photoacoustic) imaging typically relies on the spectral identification of absorption signatures from molecules of interest. To achieve this, two or more excitation wavelengths are employed to sequentially illuminate tissue. Due to depth-related spectral dependencies and detection related effects, the multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) spectral unmixing problem presents a complex non-linear inversion operation. So far, different studies have showcased the spectral capacity of optoacoustic imaging, without however relating the performance achieved to the number of wavelengths employed. Overall, the dependence of the sensitivity and accuracy of optoacoustic imaging as a function of the number of illumination wavelengths has not been so far comprehensively studied. In this paper we study the impact of the number of excitation wavelengths employed on the sensitivity and accuracy achieved by molecular optoacoustic tomography. We present a quantitative analysis, based on synthetic MSOT datasets and observe a trend of sensitivity increase for up to 20 wavelengths. Importantly we quantify this relation and demonstrate an up to an order of magnitude sensitivity increase of multi-wavelength illumination vs. single or dual wavelength optoacoustic imaging. Examples from experimental animal studies are finally utilized to support the findings.

J;Real-time snapshot hyperspectral imaging endoscope;Hyperspectral imaging has tremendous potential to detect important molecular biomarkers of early cancer based on their unique spectral signatures. Several drawbacks have limited its use for in vivo screening applications: most notably the poor temporal and spatial resolution, high expense, and low optical throughput of existing hyperspectral imagers. We present the development of a new real-time hyperspectral endoscope (called the image mapping spectroscopy endoscope) based on an image mapping technique capable of addressing these challenges. The parallel high throughput nature of this technique enables the device to operate at frame rates of 5.2 frames per second while collecting a (x, y, lambda) datacube of 350 x 350 x 48. We have successfully imaged tissue in vivo, resolving a vasculature pattern of the lower lip while simultaneously detecting oxy-hemoglobin.

J;Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography in Assessment of Breast Tumor Margins During Breast-Conserving Surgery: A First-in-human Case Study;Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is an innovative state-of-the-art imaging modality that has gained popularity for in vivo breast imaging in recent years. Combining high-resolution images with endogenous differentiation of biochemical contents, MSOT could be an accurate ex vivo imaging modality for assessment of tumor margins during breast-conserving surgery to reduce margin positivity rates. Accurate intraoperative assessment of margins could lead to more precise surgery, allowing a smaller volume of breast tissue to be removed without compromising the resection margins. To the authors' knowledge, there has been no ex vivo study conducted to this day that uses MSOT in the assessment of breast tumor margins after lumpectomy. Hence, we would like to present the first case of breast tumor margin assessment using MSOT in a 55-year-old patient who underwent breast-conserving surgery for invasive ductal carcinoma.

C;Multiparametric Radiomics for Predicting the Aggressiveness of Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma Using Hyperspectral Images;Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is primarily treated by surgical resection. During surgery, surgeons often need intraoperative frozen analysis and pathologic consultation in order to detect PTC. In some cases pathologists cannot determine if the tumor is aggressive until the operation has been completed. In this work, we have taken tumor classification a step further by determining the tumor aggressiveness of fresh surgical specimens. We employed hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in combination with multiparametric radiomic features to complete this task. The study cohort includes 72 ex-vivo tissue specimens from 44 patients with pathology-confirmed PTC. A total of 67 features were extracted from this data. Using machine learning classification methods, we were able to achieve an AUC of 0.85. Our study shows that hyperspectral imaging and multiparametric radiomic features could aid in the pathological detection of tumor aggressiveness using fresh surgical spemens obtained during surgery.;2021;10.1117/12.2582147
J;Oximetry using multispectral imaging: theory and application;Multispectral imaging (MSI) is a technique for measurement of blood oxygen saturation in vivo that can be applied using various imaging modalities to provide new insights into physiology and disease development. This tutorial aims to provide a thorough introduction to the theory and application of MSI oximetry for researchers new to the field, whilst also providing detailed information for more experienced researchers. The optical theory underlying two-wavelength oximetry, three-wavelength oximetry, pulse oximetry, and multispectral oximetry algorithms are described in detail. The varied challenges of applying MSI oximetry to in vivo applications are outlined and discussed, covering: the optical properties of blood and tissue, optical paths in blood vessels, tissue auto-fluorescence, oxygen diffusion, and common oximetry artefacts. Essential image processing techniques for MSI are discussed, in particular, image acquisition, image registration strategies, and blood vessel line profile fitting. Calibration and validation strategies for MSI are discussed, including comparison techniques, physiological interventions, and phantoms. The optical principles and unique imaging capabilities of various cutting-edge MSI oximetry techniques are discussed, including photoacoustic imaging, spectroscopic optical coherence tomography, and snapshot MSI.;2018;10.1088/2040-8986/aab74c
J;Multispectral tissue mapping: developing a concept for the optical evaluation of liver disease;Purpose: Alterations in the optical absorption behavior of liver tissue secondary to pathological processes can be evaluated by multispectral analysis, which is increasingly being explored as an imaging adjunct for use in liver surgery. Current methods are either invasive or have a limited wavelength spectrum, which restricts utility. This proof of concept study describes the development of a multispectral imaging (MSI) method called multispectral tissue mapping (MTM) that addresses these issues. Approach: The imaging system consists of a tunable excitation light source and a near-infrared camera. Following the development stage, proof of concept experiments are carried out where absorption spectra from colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver steatosis specimen are acquired and compared to controls. Absorption spectra are compared to histopathology examination as the current gold standard for tissue assessment. Generalized linear mixed modeling is employed to compare absorption characteristics of individual pixels and to select wavelengths for false color image processing with the aim of visually enhancing cancer tissue. Results: Analysis of individual pixels revealed distinct absorption spectra therefore suggesting that MTM is possible. A prominent absorption peak at 1210 nm was found in lipid-rich animal tissues and steatotic liver specimen. Liver cancer tissue had a heterogeneous appearance on MSI. Subsequent statistical analysis suggests that measuring changes in absorption behavior may be a feasible method to estimate the pixel-based probability of cancer being present. In CRLM, this was observed throughout 1100 to 1700 nm, whereas in HCC it was concentrated around 1140 and 1430 nm. False color image processing visibly enhances contrast between cancer and normal liver tissues. Conclusions: The system's ability to enable no-touch MSI at 1100 to 1700 nm was demonstrated. Preliminary data suggest that MTM warrants further exploration as a potential imaging tool for the detection of liver cancer during surgery. (C) The Authors.

J;Dual-modality endoscopic probe for tissue surface shape reconstruction and hyperspectral imaging enabled by deep neural networks;Surgical guidance and decision making could be improved with accurate and real-time measurement of intra-operative data including shape and spectral information of the tissue surface. In this work, a dual modality endoscopic system has been proposed to enable tissue surface shape reconstruction and hyperspectral imaging (HSI). This system centers around a probe comprised of an incoherent fiber bundle, whose fiber arrangement is different at the two ends, and miniature imaging optics. For 3D reconstruction with structured light (SL), a light pattern formed of randomly distributed spots with different colors is projected onto the tissue surface, creating artificial texture. Pattern decoding with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and a customized feature descriptor enables real-time 3D surface reconstruction at approximately 12 frames per second (FPS). In HSI mode, spatially sparse hyperspectral signals from the tissue surface can be captured with a slit hyperspectral imager in a single snapshot. A CNN based super-resolution model, namely super-spectral-resolution network (SSRNet), has also been developed to estimate pixel-level dense hypercubes from the endoscope cameras standard RGB images and the sparse hyperspectral signals, at approximately 2 FPS. The probe, with a 2.1 mm diameter, enables the system to be used with endoscope working channels. Furthermore, since data acquisition in both modes can be accomplished in one snapshot, operation of this system in clinical applications is minimally affected by tissue surface movement and deformation. The whole apparatus has been validated on phantoms and tissue (ex vivo and in vivo), while initial measurements on patients during laryngeal surgery show its potential in real-world clinical applications.

J;Method using in vivo quantitative spectroscopy to guide design and optimization of low-cost, compact clinical imaging devices: emulation and evaluation of multispectral imaging systems;With recent proliferation in compact and/or low-cost clinical multispectral imaging approaches and commercially available components, questions remain whether they adequately capture the requisite spectral content of their applications. We present a method to emulate the spectral range and resolution of a variety of multispectral imagers, based on in-vivo data acquired from spatial frequency domain spectroscopy (SFDS). This approach simulates spectral responses over 400 to 1100 nm. Comparing emulated data with full SFDS spectra of in-vivo tissue affords the opportunity to evaluate whether the sparse spectral content of these imagers can (1) account for all sources of optical contrast present ( completeness) and (2) robustly separate and quantify sources of optical contrast (crosstalk). We validate the approach over a range of tissue-simulating phantoms, comparing the SFDS-based emulated spectra against measurements from an independently characterized multispectral imager. Emulated results match the imager across all phantoms (< 3% absorption, < 1% reduced scattering). In-vivo test cases (burn wounds and photoaging) illustrate how SFDS can be used to evaluate different multispectral imagers. This approach provides an in-vivo measurement method to evaluate the performance of multispectral imagers specific to their targeted clinical applications and can assist in the design and optimization of new spectral imaging devices.

J;Toward Assessment of Resection Margins Using Hyperspectral Diffuse Reflection Imaging (400-1,700 nm) During Tongue Cancer Surgery;Background and Objectives There is a clinical need to assess the resection margins of tongue cancer specimens, intraoperatively. In the current ex vivo study, we evaluated the feasibility of hyperspectral diffuse reflectance imaging (HSI) for distinguishing tumor from the healthy tongue tissue. Study Design/Materials and Methods Fresh surgical specimens (n = 14) of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue were scanned with two hyperspectral cameras that cover the visible and near-infrared spectrum (400-1,700 nm). Each pixel of the hyperspectral image represents a measure of the diffuse optical reflectance. A neural network was used for tissue-type prediction of the hyperspectral images of the visual and near-infrared data sets separately as well as both data sets combined. Results HSI was able to distinguish tumor from muscle with a good accuracy. The diagnostic performance of both wavelength ranges (sensitivity/specificity of visual and near-infrared were 84%/80% and 77%/77%, respectively) appears to be comparable and there is no additional benefit of combining the two wavelength ranges (sensitivity and specificity were 83%/76%). Conclusions HSI has a strong potential for intra-operative assessment of tumor resection margins of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. This may optimize surgery, as the entire resection surface can be scanned in a single run and the results can be readily available. Lasers Surg. Med.

C;Multispectral device for help in diagnosis;In order to build biological tissues spectral characteristics database to be used in a multispectral imaging system a tissues optical characterization bench is developed and validated. Several biological tissue types have been characterized in vitro and ex vivo with our device such as beef, turkey and pork muscle and beef liver. Multispectral images obtained have been analyzed in order to study the dispersion of biological tissues spectral luminance factor. Tissue internal structure inhomogeneity was identified as a phenomenon contributing to the dispersion of spectral luminance factor. This dispersion of spectral luminance factor could be a characteristic of the tissue. A method based on envelope technique has been developed to identify and differentiate biological tissues in the same scene. This method applied to pork tissues containing muscle and fat gives detection rates of 59% for pork muscle and 14% for pork fat.;2012;10.1117/12.909107
C;Detecting Aggressive Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma Using Hyperspectral Imaging and Radiomic Features;Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and radiomics have the potential to improve the accuracy of tumor malignancy prediction and assessment. In this work, we extracted radiomic features of fresh surgical papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) specimen that were imaged with HSI. A total of 107 unique radiomic features were extracted. This study includes 72 ex-vivo tissue specimens from 44 patients with pathology-confirmed PTC. With the dilated hyperspectral images, the shape feature of least axis length was able to predict the tumor aggressiveness with a high accuracy. The HSI-based radiomic method may provide a useful tool to aid oncologists in determining tumors with intermediate to high risk and in clinical decision making.;2022;10.1117/12.2611842
J;Label-free in vivo imaging of peripheral nerve by multispectral photoacoustic tomography;Unintentional surgical damage to nerves is mainly due to poor visualization of nerve tissue relative to adjacent structures. Multispectral photoacoustic tomography can provide chemical information with specificity and ultrasonic spatial resolution with centimeter imaging depth, making it a potential tool for noninvasive neural imaging. To implement this label-free imaging approach, a multispectral photoacoustic tomography platform was built. Imaging depth and spatial resolution were characterized. In vivo imaging of the femoral nerve that is 2 mm deep in a nude mouse was performed. Through multivariate curve resolution analysis, the femoral nerve was discriminated from the femoral artery and chemical maps of their spatial distributions were generated. [GRAPHICS] The femoral nerve was discriminated from the femoral artery by multivariate curve resolution analysis.;2016;10.1002/jbio.201500004
C;A Minimum Spanning Forest Based Hyperspectral Image Classification Method for Cancerous Tissue Detection;Hyperspectral imaging is a developing modality for cancer detection. The rich information associated with hyperspectral images allow for the examination between cancerous and healthy tissue. This study focuses on a new method that incorporates support vector machines into a minimum spanning forest algorithm for differentiating cancerous tissue from normal tissue. Spectral information was gathered to test the algorithm Animal experiments were performed and hyperspectral images were acquired from tumor-bearing mice. In vivo imaging experimental results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed classification method for cancer tissue classification on hyperspectral images.;2014;10.1117/12.2043848
J;Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) for imaging the particle size-dependent intratumoral distribution of polymeric micelles;Purpose: This study proposes the utilization of multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) to investigate the intratumoral distribution of polymeric micelles and effect of size on the biodistribution and antitumor efficacy (ATE). Materials and methods: Docetaxel and/or optoacoustic agent-loaded polymeric micelles (with diameters of 22, 48, and 124 nm) were prepared using amphiphilic block copolymers poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether-block-poly (D,L lactide) (PEG(2000)-PDLLAx). Subcutaneous 4T1 tumor-bearing mice were monitored with MSOT imaging and IVIS (R) Spectrum in vivo live imaging after tail vein injection of micelles. The in vivo results and ex vivo confocal imaging results were then compared. Next, ATE of the three micelles was found and compared. Results: We found that MSOT imaging offers spatiotemporal and quantitative information on intratumoral distribution of micelles in living animals. All the polymeric micelles rapidly extravasated into tumor site after intravenous injection, but only the 22-nm micelle preferred to distribute into the inner tumor tissues, leading to a superior ATE than that of 48- and 124-nm micelles. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that MSOT is theranostically a powerful imaging modality, offering quantitative information on size-dependent spatiotemporal distribution patterns after the extravasation of nanomedicine from tumor blood vessels.;2018;10.2147/IJN.S185726
C;Hyperspectral imaging of skin and lung cancers;"The problem of cancer control requires design of new approaches for instrumental diagnostics, as the accuracy of cancer detection on the first step of diagnostics in clinics is slightly more than 50%. In this study, we present a method of visualization and diagnostics of skin and lung tumours based on registration and processing of tissues hyperspectral images. In a series of experiments registration of hyperspectral images of skin and lung tissue samples is carried out. Melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, nevi and benign tumours are studied in skin ex vivo and in vivo experiments; adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas are studied in ex vivo lung experiments. In a series of experiments the typical features of diffuse reflection spectra for pathological and normal tissues were found. Changes in tissues morphology during the tumour growth lead to the changes of blood and pigments concentration, such as melanin in skin. That is why tumours and normal tissues maybe differentiated with information about spectral response in 500-600 nm and 600 670 nm areas. Thus, hyperspectral imaging in the visible region may be a useful tool for cancer detection as it helps to estimate spectral properties of tissues and determine malignant regions for precise resection of tumours.";2016;10.1117/12.2227602
J;Noninvasive in Vivo Monitoring of the Biofate of 195 kDa Poly(vinyl alcohol) by Multispectral Fluorescence Imaging;A comprehensive knowledge of the in vivo fate of polymers is essential for their potential application in humans. In this study, the body distribution, accumulation, and elimination processes of intraperitoneally (ip) administered poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) in mice were investigated in detail. Two derivatives of PVA (195 kDa) having covalently bound fluorescent dye labels were synthesized and used to follow PVA in vivo by noninvasive multispectral fluorescence imaging over several months. Detailed ex vivo fluorescence imaging was performed additionally and combined with tissue accumulation studies using confocal microscopy. Filtration and confocal imaging at appropriate synthetic membranes, used as models for glomerular filtration, confirmed a considerable PVA permeation. This investigation yields new scientific findings about the fate of PVA in vivo. PVA accumulated in fat tissue at high levels, which suggests that PVA is suitable not only for abdominal surgeries but also for controlled release applications after ip or subcutaneous injection.;2011;10.1021/bm200899h
J;Nonlinear multispectral imaging for tumor delineation;Significance: In breast-preserving tumor surgery, the inspection of the excised tissue boundaries for tumor residue is too slow to provide feedback during the surgery. The discovery of positive margins requires a new surgery which is difficult and associated with low success. If the reexcision could be done immediately this is believed to improve the success rate considerably. Aim: Our aim is for a fast microscopic analysis that can be done directly on the excised tissue in or near the operating theatre. Approach: We demonstrate the combination of three nonlinear imaging techniques at selected wavelengths to delineate tumor boundaries. We use hyperspectral coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), second harmonic generation (SHG), and two-photon excited fluorescence (TPF) on excised patient tissue. Results: We show the discriminatory power of each of the signals and demonstrate a sensitivity of 0.87 and a specificity of 0.95 using four CARS wavelengths in combination with SHG and TPF. We verify that the information is independent of sample treatment. Conclusions: Nonlinear multispectral imaging can be used to accurately determine tumor boundaries. This demonstration using microscopy in the epi-direction directly on thick tissue slices brings this technology one step closer to clinical implementation.

C;Ex vivo assessment of the optical characteristics of human brain and tumour tissue;Emerging optical imaging techniques such as hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provide a promising non-invasive solution for intraoperative tissue characterisation with the potential to provide rich tissue-differentiation information over the entire surgical field. Neuro-oncology surgery would especially benefit from detailed real-time in vivo tissue characterisation, improving the accuracy with which boundaries of safe surgical resection are delineated and thereby improving patient outcomes. Current systems are limited by challenges with processing the HSI data because of incomplete characterisation of the optical properties of tissue across the complete visible and near-infrared wavelength spectrum. In this study, we characterised the optical properties of various freshly-excised brain tumours and normal cadaveric human brain tissue using a dual-beam integrating sphere spectrophotometer and the inverse adding-doubling technique. We adapted an integrating sphere to analyse 2 mm-thick tissue samples measuring 4 - 7 mm in diameter and validated the experimental setup with a tissue-mimicking optical phantom. We investigated the different spectral signatures of freshly-excised tumour tissues including pituitary adenoma, meningioma and vestibular schwannoma and compared these to normal grey and white matter, pons, pituitary, dura and cranial nerve tissues across the wavelength range of 400 - 1800 nm. It was found that brain and tumour tissues could be differentiated by their optical properties but the freezing process did alter the tissues' relative absorption and reduced scattering coefficients. In this work, we have demonstrated a method to characterise the optical properties of small human brain and tumour specimens that may be used as a reference dataset for developing optical imaging techniques.;2020;10.1117/12.2545694
C;Application of smoothing splines for spectroscopic analysis in hyperspectral images;The spectral and spatial resolution of hyperspectral imaging is useful for investigation of tissue autofluorescence. The low-light, noisy conditions in fluorescence imaging usually necessitates noise removal for extraction of precise spectral signatures and peak shifts. However, noise removal techniques like low-pass filtering or the Maximum Noise Fraction transform might discard information or distort spectral features. In this study, smoothing splines is proposed as an alternative technique to avoid spectral distortion in analysis of hyperspectral fluorescence images in the wavelength range 400-1000 nm. Continuous tuning parameters and use of natural cubic splines makes the method advantageous for unbiased peak extraction. The method was tested on ex vivo images of atherosclerosis lesions and simulations. The method was used to estimate autofluorescence peak shifts, and found to perform well in comparison with MNF.;2019;10.1117/12.2506618
J;Chemical imaging of lipid droplets in muscle tissues using hyperspectral coherent Raman microscopy;The accumulation of lipids in non-adipose tissues is attracting increasing attention due to its correlation with obesity. In muscle tissue, ectopic deposition of specific lipids is further correlated with pathogenic development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Most intramyocellular lipids are organized into lipid droplets (LDs), which are metabolically active organelles. In order to better understand the putative role of LDs in pathogenesis, insight into both the location of LDs and nearby chemistry of muscle tissue is very useful. Here, we demonstrate the use of label-free coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy in combination with multivariate, chemometric analysis to visualize intracellular lipid accumulations in ex vivo muscle tissue. Consistent with our previous results, hyperspectral CARS microscopy showed an increase in LDs in tissues where LD proteins were overexpressed, and further chemometric analysis showed additional features morphologically (and chemically) similar to mitochondria that colocalized with LDs. CARS imaging is shown to be a very useful method for label-free stratification of ectopic fat deposition and cellular organelles in fresh tissue sections with virtually no sample preparation.;2014;10.1007/s00418-013-1161-2
J;Artificial intelligence and hyperspectral imaging for image-guided assistance in minimally invasive surgery;Background Intraoperative imaging assists surgeons during minimally invasive procedures. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a noninvasive and noncontact optical technique with great diagnostic potential in medicine. The combination with artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to analyze HSI data is called intelligent HSI in this article. Objective What are the medical applications and advantages of intelligent HSI for minimally invasive visceral surgery? Material and methods Within various clinical studies HSI data from multiple in vivo tissue types and oncological resections were acquired using an HSI camera system. Different AI algorithms were evaluated for detection and discrimination of organs, risk structures and tumors. Results In an experimental animal study 20 different organs could be differentiated with high precision (> 95%) using AI. In vivo, the parathyroid glands could be discriminated from surrounding tissue with an F1 score of 47% and sensitivity of 75%, and the bile duct with an F1 score of 79% and sensitivity of 90%. Furthermore, ex vivo tumor tissue could be successfully detected with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) larger than 0.91. Discussion This study demonstrates that intelligent HSI can automatically and accurately detect different tissue types. Despite great progress in the last decade intelligent HSI still has limitations. Thus, accurate AI algorithms that are easier to understand for the user and an extensive standardized and continuously growing database are needed. Further clinical studies should support the various medical applications and lead to the adoption of intelligent HSI in the clinical routine practice.;2022;10.1007/s00104-022-01677-w
C;Estimation of Tissue Optical Parameters with Hyperspectral Imaging and Spectral Unmixing;Early detection of oral cancer and its curable precursors can improve patient survival and quality of life. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) holds the potential for noninvasive early detection of oral cancer. The quantification of tissue chromophores by spectral unmixing of hyperspectral images could provide insights for evaluating cancer progression. In this study, non-negative matrix factorization has been applied for decomposing hyperspectral images into physiologically meaningful chromophore concentration maps. The approach has been validated by computer-simulated hyperspectral images and in vivo tumor hyperspectral images from a head and neck cancer animal model.;2015;10.1117/12.2082299
C;In vivo and in vitro hyperspectral imaging of cervical neoplasia;Cervical cancer is a prevalent disease in many developing countries. Colposcopy is the most common approach for screening cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). However, its clinical efficacy heavily relies on the examiner's experience. Spectroscopy is a potentially effective method for noninvasive diagnosis of cervical neoplasia. In this paper, we introduce a hyperspectral imaging technique for noninvasive detection and quantitative analysis of cervical neoplasia. A hyperspectral camera is used to collect the reflectance images of the entire cervix under xenon lamp illumination, followed by standard colposcopy examination and cervical tissue biopsy at both normal and abnormal sites in different quadrants. The collected reflectance data are calibrated and the hyperspectral signals are extracted. Further spectral analysis and image processing works are carried out to classify tissue into different types based on the spectral characteristics at different stages of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. The hyperspectral camera is also coupled with a lab microscope to acquire the hyperspectral transmittance images of the pathological slides. The in vivo and the in vitro imaging results are compared with clinical findings to assess the accuracy and efficacy of the method.;2014;10.1117/12.2041046
C;Open-air Multispectral Fluorescence-guided Surgery Platform for Intraoperative Detection of Malignant Tissue under Ambient Lighting Conditions;Intraoperative resection of tumors currently relies upon the surgeon's ability to visually locate and palpate tumor nodules. Undetected residual malignant tissue often results in the need for additional treatment or surgical intervention. The Solaris T platform is a multispectral open-air fluorescence imaging system designed for translational fluorescence-guided surgery. Solaris supports video-rate imaging in four fixed fluorescence channels ranging from visible to near infrared, and a multispectral channel equipped with a liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF) for multispectral image acquisition (520-620 nm). Identification of tumor margins using reagents emitting in the visible spectrum (400-650 nm), such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), present challenges considering the presence of auto-fluorescence from tissue and food in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. To overcome this, Solaris acquires LCTF-based multispectral images, and by applying an automated spectral unmixing algorithm to the data, separates reagent fluorescence from tissue and food auto-fluorescence. The unmixing algorithm uses vertex component analysis to automatically extract the primary pure spectra, and resolves the reagent fluorescent signal using non-negative least squares. For validation, intraoperative in vivo studies were carried out in tumor-bearing rodents injected with FITC-dextran reagent that is primarily residing in malignant tissue 24 hours post injection. In the absence of unmixing, fluorescence from tumors is not distinguishable from that of surrounding tissue. Upon spectral unmixing, the FITC-labeled malignant regions become well defined and detectable. The results of these studies substantiate the multispectral power of Solaris in resolving FITC-based agent signal in deep tumor masses, under ambient and surgical light, and enhancing the ability to surgically resect them.;2017;10.1117/12.2255669
C;The hyperspectral Imaging endoscope: A new tool for in vivo cancer detection;We developed a new endoscope that allows for non-contact, rapid (sub-second) acquisition of polarized spectral images of tissue in vivo. The intent was to enable exploration of a variety of optical contrast mechanisms (such as light absorption, reflectance, scattering, and fluorescence) in a search for new methods of early cancer detection in a clinical setting. Our first new implementation for cancer detection is based on a body of spectroscopic work that employs elastic scattering (Mie) theory to estimate the size of bulk scatterers in a given medium - in our case, the epithelial tissue of lungs. This paper describes the novel design of the Hyperspectral Imaging Endoscope, and our initial experiences with employing it for the early detection of dysplasia and cancer in lung epithelia.;2004;10.1117/12.561884
C;Ex-vivo characterization of human healthy colon and colorectal cancer by multispectral Mueller polarimetric imaging and its polar decomposition;Mueller matrix polarimetric imaging (MMPI) provides precise microstructural information of biological samples and has been applied to the detections of various abnormal tissues. Once the Mueller matrix is determined for a particular anisotropic material, polar decomposition is applied to determine the singular values of optical anisotropies, such as depolarization, diattenuation, retardance and optical rotation. In this work, ex-vivo cancerous and noncancerous tissues were imaged by the MMPI technique using 3 different radiation wavelengths (460, 532 and 633 nm). The samples under study were cancerous and noncancerous tissues from colon. The results show that the optical anisotropies from biological samples are different. As we know, cancer changes the structure and concentration of biomedical substances from healthy tissue. One of the structures that is affected by cancer is collagen. This structure contributes to the diatenuation and retardance values. Therefore the values of diatenuation and retardance are different from the malignant and healthy tissues. We demonstrate that MMPI and polar decomposition are useful tools to discriminate healthy tissue and cancerous tissue from different parts of the body.;2019;10.1117/12.2531113
J;Handheld multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging system for in vivo applications;There is an increasing interest in the application of fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) for medical diagnosis. Central to the clinical translation of FLIM technology is the development of compact and highspeed clinically compatible systems. We present a handheld probe design consisting of a small maneuverable box fitted with a rigid endoscope, capable of continuous lifetime imaging at multiple emission bands simultaneously. The system was characterized using standard fluorescent dyes. The performance was then further demonstrated by imaging a hamster cheek pouch in vivo, and oral mucosa tissue both ex vivo and in vivo, all using safe and permissible exposure levels. Such a design can greatly facilitate the evaluation of FLIM for oral cancer imaging in vivo. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America;2014;10.1364/BOE.5.000921
C;Pixel-level Tumor Margin Assessment of Surgical Specimen with Hyperspectral Imaging and Deep Learning Classification;Surgery is a major treatment method for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). During surgery, insufficient tumor margin may lead to local recurrence of cancer. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a promising optical imaging technique for in vivo cancer detection and tumor margin assessment. In this study, a fully convolutional network (FCN) was implemented for tumor classification and margin assessment on hyperspectral images of SCC. The FCN was trained and validated with hyperspectral images of 25 ex vivo SCC surgical specimens from 20 different patients. The network was evaluated per patient and achieved pixel-level tissue classification with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88, as well as 0.83 accuracy, 0.84 sensitivity, and 0.70 specificity across all the 20 patients. The 95% Hausdorff distance of assessed tumor margin in 17 patients was less than 2 mm, and the classification time of each tissue specimen took less than 10 seconds. The proposed methods can potentially facilitate intraoperative tumor margin assessment and improve surgical outcomes.;2021;10.1117/12.2581046
J;Multispectral Photoacoustic Imaging of Tumor Protease Activity with a Gold Nanocage-Based Activatable Probe;PurposeTumor proteases have been recognized as significant regulators in the tumor microenvironment, but the current strategies for in vivo protease imaging have tended to focus on the development of a probe design rather than the investigation of a novel imaging strategy by leveraging the imaging technique and probe. Herein, it is the first report to investigate the ability of multispectral photoacoustic imaging (PAI) to estimate the distribution of protease cleavage sites inside living tumor tissue by using an activatable photoacoustic (PA) probe.ProceduresThe protease MMP-2 is selected as the target. In this probe, gold nanocages (GNCs) with an absorption peak at 800nm and fluorescent dye molecules with an absorption peak at 680nm are conjugated via a specific enzymatic peptide substrate. Upon enzymatic activation by MMP-2, the peptide substrate is cleaved and the chromophores are released. Due to the different retention speeds of large GNCs and small dye molecules, the probe alters its intrinsic absorption profile and produces a distinct change in the PA signal. A multispectral PAI technique that can distinguish different chromophores based on intrinsic PA spectral signatures is applied to estimate the signal composition changes and indicate the cleavage interaction sites. Finally, the multispectral PAI technique with the activatable probe is tested in solution, cultured cells, and a subcutaneous tumor model in vivo.ResultsOur experiment in solution with enzyme inhibitor, cell culture +/- inhibitor, and in vivo tumor model with administration of the developed probe +/- inhibitor demonstrated the probe was cleaved by the targeted enzyme. Particularly, the in vivo estimation of the cleavage site distribution was validated with the result of ex vivo immunohistochemistry analysis.Conclusions This novel synergy of the multispectral PAI technique and the activatable probe is a potential strategy for the distribution estimation of tumor protease activity in vivo.;2018;10.1007/s11307-018-1203-1
J;Classification of Hyperspectral In Vivo Brain Tissue Based on Linear Unmixing;Hyperspectral imaging is a multidimensional optical technique with the potential of providing fast and accurate tissue classification. The main challenge is the adequate processing of the multidimensional information usually linked to long processing times and significant computational costs, which require expensive hardware. In this study, we address the problem of tissue classification for intraoperative hyperspectral images of in vivo brain tissue. For this goal, two methodologies are introduced that rely on a blind linear unmixing (BLU) scheme for practical tissue classification. Both methodologies identify the characteristic end-members related to the studied tissue classes by BLU from a training dataset and classify the pixels by a minimum distance approach. The proposed methodologies are compared with a machine learning method based on a supervised support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The methodologies based on BLU achieve speedup factors of similar to 459x and similar to 429x compared to the SVM scheme, while keeping constant and even slightly improving the classification performance.;2020;10.3390/app10165686
J;Multispectral fluorescence imaging to assess pH in biological specimens;Simple, quantitative assays to measure pH in tissue could improve the study of complicated biological processes and diseases such as cancer. We evaluated multispectral fluorescence imaging (MSFI) to quantify extracellular pH (pH(e)) in dye-perfused, surgically-resected tumor specimens with commercially available instrumentation. Utilizing a water-soluble organic dye with pH-dependent fluorescence emission (SNARF-4F), we used standard fluorimetry to quantitatively assess the emission properties of the dye as a function of pH. By conducting these studies within the spectroscopic constraints imposed by the appropriate imaging filter set supplied with the imaging system, we determined that correction of the fluorescence emission of deprotonated dye was necessary for accurate determination of pH due to suboptimal excitation. Subsequently, employing a fluorimetry-derived correction factor (C-F), MSFI data sets of aqueous dye solutions and tissuelike phantoms could be spectrally unmixed to accurately quantify equilibrium concentrations of protonated (HA) and deprotonated (A(-)) dye and thus determine solution pH. Finally, we explored the feasibility of MSFI for high-resolution pH(e) mapping of human colorectal cancer cell-line xenografts. Data presented suggest that MSFI is suitable for quantitative determination of pH(e) in ex vivo dye-perfused tissue, potentially enabling measurement of pH across a variety of preclinical models of disease.

C;Evaluation of MultiSpectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) performance in phantoms and in vivo;MultiSpectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) is an emerging modality that combines the high contrast of optical imaging with the spatial resolution and penetration depth of ultrasound, to provide detailed images of hemoglobin concentration and oxygenation. To facilitate accurate determination of changes in the vascularity and oxygenation of a biological tissue over time, for example, a tumor in response to cancer therapy, an extensive study of stability and reproducibility of a small animal MSOT system has been performed. Investigations were first made with a stable phantom imaged repeatedly over time scales of hours, days and months, to evaluate the reproducibility of the system over time. We found that the small animal MSOT system exhibited excellent reproducibility with a coefficient of variation (COV) in the measured MSOT signals of less than 8% over the course of 30 days and within 1.5% over a single day. Experiments performed in vivo demonstrated the potential for measurement of oxyhemoglobin over time in a realistic experimental setting. The effect of breathing medical air or oxygen under conditions of fixed respiration rate and body temperature within normal organs, including the spleen and kidneys, were investigated. The COV for oxyhemoglobin signals retrieved from spectral unmixing was assessed within both biological (different mouse) and imaging (different scan) replicates. As expected, biological replicates produced a large COV (up to 40% within the spleen) compared to imaging replicates within a single mouse (up to 10% within the spleen). Furthermore, no significant difference was found between data acquired by different operators. The data presented here suggest that MSOT is highly reproducible for both phantom and in vivo imaging, hence could reliably detect changes in oxygenation occurring in living subjects.;2015;10.1117/12.2077501
C;Non-invasive imaging of skin cancer with fluorescence lifetime imaging using two photon tomography;Multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) using two photon microscopy as a non-invasive technique for the diagnosis of skin lesions is described. Skin contains fluorophores including elastin, keratin, collagen, FAD and NADH. This endogenous contrast allows tissue to be imaged without the addition of exogenous agents and allows the in vivo state of cells and tissues to be studied. A modified DermaInspect (R) multiphoton tomography system was used to excite autofluorescence at 760 nm in vivo and on freshly excised ex vivo tissue. This instrument simultaneously acquires fluorescence lifetime images in four spectral channels between 360-655 nm using time-correlated single photon counting and can also provide hyperspectral images. The multispectral fluorescence lifetime images were spatially segmented and binned to determine lifetimes for each cell by fitting to a double exponential lifetime model. A comparative analysis between the cellular lifetimes from different diagnoses demonstrates significant diagnostic potential.;2011;10.1117/12.889314
J;Extending immunofluorescence detection limits in whole paraffin-embedded formalin fixed tissues using hyperspectral confocal fluorescence imaging;A major problem in microscopic imaging of ex vivo tissue sections stained with fluorescent agents (e.g. antibodies, peptides) is the confounding presence of background tissue autofluorescence. Autofluorescence limits (1) the accuracy of differentiating background signals from single and multiple fluorescence labels and (2) reliable quantification of fluorescent signals. Advanced techniques such as hyperspectral imaging and spectral unmixing can be applied to essentially remove this autofluorescent signal contribution, and this work attempts to quantify the effectiveness of autofluorescence spectral unmixing in a tumour xenograft model. Whole-specimen single-channel fluorescence images were acquired using excitation wavelengths of 488 nm (producing high autofluorescence) and 568 nm (producing negligible autofluorescence). These single-channel data sets are quantified against hyperspectral images acquired at 488 nm using a prototype whole-slide hyperspectral fluorescence scanner developed in our facility. The development and further refinement of this instrument will improve the quantification of weak fluorescent signals in fluorescence microscopy studies of ex vivo tissues in both preclinical and clinical applications.;2009;10.1111/j.1365-2818.2009.03155.x
J;Intraoperative hyperspectral label-free imaging: from system design to first-in-patient translation;Despite advances in intraoperative surgical imaging, reliable discrimination of critical tissue during surgery remains challenging. As a result, decisions with potentially life-changing consequences for patients are still based on the surgeon's subjective visual assessment. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides a promising solution for objective intraoperative tissue characterisation, with the advantages of being non-contact, non-ionising and non-invasive. However, while its potential to aid surgical decision-making has been investigated for a range of applications, to date no real-time intraoperative HSI (iHSI) system has been presented that follows critical design considerations to ensure a satisfactory integration into the surgical workflow. By establishing functional and technical requirements of an intraoperative system for surgery, we present an iHSI system design that allows for real-time wide-field HSI and responsive surgical guidance in a highly constrained operating theatre. Two systems exploiting state-of-the-art industrial HSI cameras, respectively using linescan and snapshot imaging technology, were designed and investigated by performing assessments against established design criteria and ex vivo tissue experiments. Finally, we report the use of our real-time iHSI system in a clinical feasibility case study as part of a spinal fusion surgery. Our results demonstrate seamless integration into existing surgical workflows.;2021;10.1088/1361-6463/abfbf6
J;Dual Ultrasound and Photoacoustic Tracking of Magnetically Driven Micromotors: From In Vitro to In Vivo;The fast evolution of medical micro- and nanorobots in the endeavor to perform non-invasive medical operations in living organisms has boosted the use of diverse medical imaging techniques in the last years. Among those techniques, photoacoustic imaging (PAI), considered a functional technique, has shown to be promising for the visualization of micromotors in deep tissue with high spatiotemporal resolution as it possesses the molecular specificity of optical methods and the penetration depth of ultrasound. However, the precise maneuvering and function's control of medical micromotors, in particular in living organisms, require both anatomical and functional imaging feedback. Therefore, herein, the use of high-frequency ultrasound and PAI is reported to obtain anatomical and molecular information, respectively, of magnetically-driven micromotors in vitro and under ex vivo tissues. Furthermore, the steerability of the micromotors is demonstrated by the action of an external magnetic field into the uterus and bladder of living mice in real-time, being able to discriminate the micromotors' signal from one of the endogenous chromophores by multispectral analysis. Finally, the successful loading and release of a model cargo by the micromotors toward non-invasive in vivo medical interventions is demonstrated.;2021;10.1002/adhm.202101077
J;Band selection for oxygenation estimation with multispectral/hyperspectral imaging;Multispectral imaging provides valuable information on tissue composition such as hemoglobin oxygen saturation. However, the real-time application of this technique in interventional medicine can be challenging due to the long acquisition times needed for large amounts of hyperspectral data with hundreds of bands. While this challenge can partially be addressed by choosing a discriminative subset of bands, the band selection methods proposed to date are mainly restricted by the availability of often hard to obtain reference measurements. We address this bottleneck with a new approach to band selection that leverages highly accurate Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. We hypothesize that a so chosen small subset of bands can reproduce or even improve upon the results of a quasi continuous spectral measurement. We further investigate whether novel domain adaptation techniques can address the inevitable domain shift stemming from the use of simulations. Initial results based on in silico and in vivo experiments suggest that 10-20 bands are sufficient to closely reproduce results from spectral measurements with 101 bands in the 500-700 nm range. The investigated domain adaptation technique, which only requires unlabeled in vivo measurements, yielded better results than the pure in silico band selection method. Overall, our method could guide development of fast multispectral imaging systems suited for interventional use without relying on complex hardware setups or manually labeled data.;2022;10.1364/BOE.441214
J;Prediction of In Vivo Laser-Induced Thermal Damage with Hyperspectral Imaging Using Deep Learning;"Thermal ablation is an acceptable alternative treatment for primary liver cancer, of which laser ablation (LA) is one of the least invasive approaches, especially for tumors in high-risk locations. Precise control of the LA effect is required to safely destroy the tumor. Although temperature imaging techniques provide an indirect measurement of the thermal damage, a degree of uncertainty remains about the treatment effect. Optical techniques are currently emerging as tools to directly assess tissue thermal damage. Among them, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has shown promising results in image-guided surgery and in the thermal ablation field. The highly informative data provided by HSI, associated with deep learning, enable the implementation of non-invasive prediction models to be used intraoperatively. Here we show a novel paradigm peak temperature prediction model  (PTPM), convolutional neural network (CNN)-based, trained with HSI and infrared imaging to predict LA-induced damage in the liver. The PTPM demonstrated an optimal agreement with tissue damage classification providing a consistent threshold (50.6 & PLUSMN; 1.5 & DEG;C) for the damage margins with high accuracy (-0.90). The high correlation with the histology score (r = 0.9085) and the comparison with the measured peak temperature confirmed that PTPM preserves temperature information accordingly with the histopathological assessment.";2021;10.3390/s21206934
J;Intraoperative hyperspectral determination of human tissue properties;We address the automatic differentiation of human tissue using multispectral imaging with promising potential for automatic visualization during surgery. Currently, tissue types have to be continuously differentiated based on the surgeon's knowledge only. Further, automatic methods based on optical in vivo properties of human tissue do not yet exist, as these properties have not been sufficiently examined. To overcome this, we developed a hyperspectral camera setup to monitor the different optical behavior of tissue types in vivo. The aim of this work is to collect and analyze these behaviors to open up optical opportunities during surgery. Our setup uses a digital camera and several bandpass filters in front of the light source to illuminate different tissue types with 16 specific wavelength ranges. We analyzed the different intensities of eight healthy tissue types over the visible spectrum (400 to 700 nm). Using our setup and sophisticated postprocessing in order to handle motion during capturing, we are able to find tissue characteristics not visible for the human eye to differentiate tissue types in the 16-dimensional wavelength domain. Our analysis shows that this approach has the potential to support the surgeon's decisions during treatment. (C) The Authors.

J;High-speed multispectral confocal biomedical imaging;A new approach for generating high-speed multispectral confocal images has been developed. The central concept is that spectra can be acquired for each pixel in a confocal spatial scan by using a fast spectrometer based on optical fiber delay lines. This approach merges fast spectroscopy with standard spatial scanning to create datacubes in real time. The spectrometer is based on a serial array of reflecting spectral elements, delay lines between these elements, and a single element detector. The spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution of the instrument is described and illustrated by multispectral images of laser-induced autofluorescence in biological tissues.

S;Calibration and Validation Scheme for In Vivo Spectroscopic Imaging of Tissue Oxygenation;The determination of the level of oxygenation in optically accessible tissues using multispectral or hyperspectral imaging (HSI) of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin has special appeal in clinical work due to its noninvasiveness, ease of use, and capability of providing molecular and anatomical information at near video rates during surgery. In this paper we refer to an example of the use of HSI in monitoring oxygenation of kidneys during partial nephrectomy. In a study using porcine models, it was found that artery-only clamping left the kidney better oxygenated, as opposed to simultaneously clamping the artery and the vein. A subsequent study correlates gradations in blood flow by partial clamping during the surgical procedure with postoperative renal function via assessment of creatinine level. We discuss the various contributions to the uncertainty of the oxygen saturation measured by this remote-sensing imaging technique in medical application.;2013;10.1007/978-1-4614-4989-8_18
C;Hyperspectral imaging for tissue classification in glioblastoma tumor patients: a deep spectral-spatial approach;Surgery is a crucial treatment for malignant brain tumors where gross total resection improves the prognosis. Tissue samples taken during surgery are either subject to a preliminary intraoperative histological analysis, or sent for a full pathological evaluation which can take days or weeks. Whereas a lengthy complete pathological analysis includes an array of techniques to be executed, a preliminary tissue analysis on frozen tissue is performed as quickly as possible (30-45 minutes on average) to provide fast feedback to the surgeon during the surgery. The surgeon uses the information to confirm that the resected tissue is indeed tumor and may, at least in theory, initiate repeated biopsies to help achieve gross total resection. However, due to the total turn-around time of the tissue inspection for repeated analyses, this approach may not be feasible during a single surgery. In this context, intraoperative image-guided techniques can improve the clinical workflow for tumor resection and improve outcome by aiding in the identification and removal of the malignant lesion. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an optical imaging technique with the potential to extract combined spectral-spatial information. By exploiting HSI for human brain-tissue classification in 13 in-vivo hyperspectral images from 9 patients, a brain-tissue classifier is developed. The framework consists of a hybrid 3D-2D CNN-based approach and a band-selection step to enhance the capability of extracting both spectral and spatial information from the hyperspectral images. An overall accuracy of 77% was found when tumor, normal and hyper-vascularized tissue are classified, which clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches (SVM, 2D-CNN). These results may open an attractive future perspective for intraoperative brain-tumor classification using HSI.;2021;10.1117/12.2580158
J;Multispectral imaging of organ viability during uterine transplantation surgery in rabbits and sheep;Uterine transplantation surgery (UTx) has been proposed as a treatment for permanent absolute uterine factor infertility (AUFI) in the case of the congenital absence or surgical removal of the uterus. Successful surgical attachment of the organ and its associated vasculature is essential for the organ's reperfusion and long-term viability. Spectral imaging techniques have demonstrated the potential for the measurement of hemodynamics in medical applications. These involve the measurement of reflectance spectra by acquiring images of the tissue in different wavebands. Measures of tissue constituents at each pixel can then be extracted from these spectra through modeling of the light-tissue interaction. A multispectral imaging (MSI) laparoscope was used in sheep and rabbit UTx models to study short-and long-term changes in oxygen saturation following surgery. The whole organ was imaged in the donor and recipient animals in parallel with point measurements from a pulse oximeter. Imaging results confirmed the re-establishment of adequate perfusion in the transplanted organ after surgery. Cornual oxygenation trends measured with MSI are consistent with pulse oximeter readings, showing decreased StO(2) immediately after anastomosis of the blood vessels. Long-term results show recovery of StO2 to preoperative levels. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.

J;Hyperspectral imaging in the spatial frequency domain with a supercontinuum source;We introduce a method for quantitative hyperspectral optical imaging in the spatial frequency domain (hs-SFDI) to image tissue absorption (mu(a)) and reduced scattering (mu(s)') parameters over a broad spectral range. The hs-SFDI utilizes principles of spatial scanning of the spectrally dispersed output of a supercontinuum laser that is sinusoidally projected onto the tissue using a digital micromirror device. A scientific complementary metal- oxide-semiconductor camera is used for capturing images that are demodulated and analyzed using SFDI computational models. The hs-SFDI performance is validated using tissue-simulating phantoms over a range of mu(a) and mu(s)' values. Quantitative hs-SFDI images are obtained from an ex-vivo beef sample to spatially resolve concentrations of oxy-, deoxy-, and met-hemoglobin, as well as water and fat fractions. Our results demonstrate that the hs-SFDI can quantitatively image tissue optical properties with 1000 spectral bins in the 580- to 950-nm range over a wide, scalable field of view. With an average accuracy of 6.7% and 12.3% in mu(a) and mu(s)' respectively, compared to conventional methods, hs-SFDI offers a promising approach for quantitative hyperspectral tissue optical imaging.

J;Manifold Embedding and Semantic Segmentation for Intraoperative Guidance With Hyperspectral Brain Imaging;Recent advances in hyperspectral imaging have made it a promising solution for intra-operative tissue characterization, with the advantages of being non-contact, non-ionizing, and non-invasive. Working with hyperspectral images in vivo, however, is not straightforward as the high dimensionality of the data makes real-time processing challenging. In this paper, a novel dimensionality reduction scheme and a new processing pipeline are introduced to obtain a detailed tumor classification map for intraoperative margin definition during brain surgery. However, existing approaches to dimensionality reduction based on manifold embedding can be time consuming and may not guarantee a consistent result, thus hindering final tissue classification. The proposed framework aims to overcome these problems through a process divided into two steps: dimensionality reduction based on an extension of the T-distributed stochastic neighbor approach is first performed and then a semantic segmentation technique is applied to the embedded results by using a Semantic Texton Forest for tissue classification. Detailed in vivo validation of the proposed method has been performed to demonstrate the potential clinical value of the system.;2017;10.1109/TMI.2017.2695523
C;Surgical Aid Visualization System for Glioblastoma Tumor Identification based on Deep Learning and In-Vivo Hyperspectral Images of Human Patients;Brain cancer surgery has the goal of performing an accurate resection of the tumor and preserving as much as possible the quality of life of the patient. There is a clinical need to develop non-invasive techniques that can provide reliable assistance for tumor resection in real-time during surgical procedures. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) arises as a new, non-invasive and non-ionizing technique that can assist neurosurgeons during this difficult task. In this paper, we explore the use of deep learning (DL) techniques for processing hyperspectral (HS) images of in-vivo human brain tissue. We developed a surgical aid visualization system capable of offering guidance to the operating surgeon to achieve a successful and accurate tumor resection. The employed HS database is composed of 26 in-vivo hypercubes from 16 different human patients, among which 258,810 labelled pixels were used for evaluation. The proposed DL methods achieve an overall accuracy of 95% and 85% for binary and multiclass classifications, respectively. The proposed visualization system is able to generate a classification map that is formed by the combination of the DL map and an unsupervised clustering via a majority voting algorithm. This map can be adjusted by the operating surgeon to find the suitable configuration for the current situation during the surgical procedure.;2019;10.1117/12.2512569
C;Multispectral fluorescence imaging of human ovarian and Fallopian tube tissue for early stage cancer detection;With early detection, five year survival rates for ovarian cancer are over 90%, yet no effective early screening method exists. Emerging consensus suggests that perhaps over 50% of the most lethal form of the disease, high grade serous ovarian cancer, originates in the Fallopian tube. Cancer changes molecular concentrations of various endogenous fluorophores. Using specific excitation wavelengths and emissions bands on a Multispectral Fluorescence Imaging (MFI) system, spatial and spectral data over a wide field of view can be collected from endogenous fluorophores. Wavelength specific reflectance images provide additional information to normalize for tissue geometry and blood absorption. Ratiometric combination of the images may create high contrast between neighboring normal and abnormal tissue. Twenty-six women undergoing oophorectomy or debulking surgery consented the use of surgical discard tissue samples for MFI imaging. Forty-nine pieces of ovarian tissue and thirty-two pieces of Fallopian tube tissue were collected and imaged with excitation wavelengths between 280 nm and 550 nm. After imaging, each tissue sample was fixed, sectioned and H&E stained for pathological evaluation. Comparison of mean intensity values between normal, benign, and cancerous tissue demonstrate a general trend of increased fluorescence of benign tissue and decreased fluorescence of cancerous tissue when compared to normal tissue. The predictive capabilities of the mean intensity measurements are tested using multinomial logistic regression and quadratic discriminant analysis. Adaption of the system for in vivo Fallopian tube and ovary endoscopic imaging is possible and is briefly described.;2015;10.1117/12.2079791
C;In vivo hyperspectral imaging and differentiation of skin cancer;Results of hyperspectral imaging analysis for in vivo visualization of skin neoplasms are presented. 16 melanomas, 19 basal cell carcinomas and 10 benign tumors with different stages of neoplasm growth were tested. The HSI system provide skin tissue images with 5 nm spectral resolution in the range of 450-750 nm with automatic stabilization of each frame compensating displacement of the scanning area due to spontaneous macro-movements of the patient. The integrated optical densities in 530-600 and 600-670 nm ranges are used for real-time hemoglobin and melanin distribution imaging in skin tissue. It was shown that the total accuracy of skin cancer identification exceeds 90% and 70% for differentiation of melanomas from BCC and begihn tumors. It was demonstrated the possibility for HSI classification of melanomas of different stages.;2017;10.1117/12.2246433
J;Ex-vivo characterization of human colon cancer by Mueller polarimetric imaging;Cancerous and healthy human colon samples have been analyzed ex-vivo using a multispectral imaging Mueller polarimeter operated in the visible (from 500 to 700 nm) in a backscattering configuration with diffuse light illumination. Three samples of Liberkuhn colon adenocarcinomas have been studied: common, mucinous and treated by radiochemotherapy. For each sample, several specific zones have been chosen, based on their visual staging and polarimetric responses, which have been correlated to the histology of the corresponding cuts. The most relevant polarimetric images are those quantifying the depolarization for incident linearly polarized light. The measured depolarization depends on several factors, namely the presence or absence of tumor, its exophytic (budding) or endophytic (penetrating) nature, its thickness (its degree of ulceration) and its level of penetration in deeper layers (submucosa, muscularis externa and serosa). The cellular density, the concentration of stroma, the presence or absence of mucus and the light penetration depth, which increases with wavelength, are also relevant parameters. Our data indicate that the tissues with the lowest and highest depolarizing powers are respectively mucus-free tumoral tissue with high cellular density and healthy serosa, while healthy submucosa, muscularis externa as well as mucinous tumor probably feature intermediate values. Moreover, the specimen coming from a patient treated successfully with radiochemotherapy exhibited a uniform polarimetric response typical of healthy tissue even in the initially pathological zone. These results demonstrate that multi-spectral Mueller imaging can provide useful contrasts to quickly stage human colon cancer ex-vivo and to distinguish between different histological variants of tumor.

J;Hyperspectral Imaging for Glioblastoma Surgery: Improving Tumor Identification Using a Deep Spectral-Spatial Approach;The primary treatment for malignant brain tumors is surgical resection. While gross total resection improves the prognosis, a supratotal resection may result in neurological deficits. On the other hand, accurate intraoperative identification of the tumor boundaries may be very difficult, resulting in subtotal resections. Histological examination of biopsies can be used repeatedly to help achieve gross total resection but this is not practically feasible due to the turn-around time of the tissue analysis. Therefore, intraoperative techniques to recognize tissue types are investigated to expedite the clinical workflow for tumor resection and improve outcome by aiding in the identification and removal of the malignant lesion. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an optical imaging technique with the power of extracting additional information from the imaged tissue. Because HSI images cannot be visually assessed by human observers, we instead exploit artificial intelligence techniques and leverage a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to investigate the potential of HSI in twelve in vivo specimens. The proposed framework consists of a 3D-2D hybrid CNN-based approach to create a joint extraction of spectral and spatial information from hyperspectral images. A comparison study was conducted exploiting a 2D CNN, a 1D DNN and two conventional classification methods (SVM, and the SVM classifier combined with the 3D-2D hybrid CNN) to validate the proposed network. An overall accuracy of 80% was found when tumor, healthy tissue and blood vessels were classified, clearly outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. These results can serve as a basis for brain tumor classification using HSI, and may open future avenues for image-guided neurosurgical applications.;2020;10.3390/s20236955
C;Quantifying mucosal blood volume fraction from multispectral images of the colon;One of the common physiological changes associated with cancer is the formation of a dense, irregular and leaky network of new blood vessels, which result in the increase of the blood volume fraction (BVF) at the site of a tumour. Such changes are not always obvious through visual inspection using a direct observation, an endoscopic device or colour photography. This paper presents a method for deriving quantitative estimates of BVF of the colon mucosa from multispectral images of the colon. The method has two stages. In the first (forward) stage a physics-based model of light propagation computes the spectra corresponding to a range of instances of the colon tissue, and in particular the spectral changes resulting from changes in the quantity of blood volume fraction, haemoglobin saturation, the size and density of scattering particles, and the tissue thickness. In the second stage (model inversion) the spectra obtained from the image data are used to derive the values of the above histological parameters. Parametric maps of the blood contents are created by storing at every pixel the BVF value recovered through the model inversion. In a pilot study multispectral images of ex-vivo samples of the colon were acquired from 8 patients. The samples contained histologically confirmed instances of adenocarcinoma and other pathologies. The parametric maps of BVF showed the significant increase in blood volume fraction (up to 75% above that of the surrounding the normal tissue). A Mann-Whitney test with Bonferroni correction showed that all but one of the differences (a benign neoplastic polyp) are significant (p < 0.000 15).;2007;10.1117/12.709559
C;Analysis of hyperspectral camera settings for assessing liver tissue thermal damage;Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is gaining, tremendous acceptance as an innovative non-invasive approach in the medical field. HSI is a sensing technique combining spectral and spatial information of the object of interest. Preliminary works have investigated the use of HSI for the intraoperative guidance of minimally invasive therapy such as thermal therapies. Data collected by the HSI system carry information of the tissue texture and may potentially track structural modifications caused by thermal treatment providing an alternative approach to the direct monitoring of the thermal outcome induced during the treatment. In this work, a commercial hyperspectral (HS) camera, working in the visible and near-infrared spectral range, has been tested for the estimation of thermal damage in the ex vivo liver. Firstly, the optimal experimental setup and settings to evaluate the optical response of tissues with the HSI were identified. Then, the reflectance of not-damaged tissue (room temperature) and tissue subjected to thermal damage was acquired and compared. Specifically, the damage was induced by homogeneously heating the tissue until reaching 50.0 degrees C and 70.0 degrees C. Inter-individual and intra-individual variability analysis was also computed using multiple samples and showed that by using the first derivative of reflectance the sources of variability are minimized. Furthermore, the first derivative shows variation in the shape mainly localized in the range [600-700] nm for the tissue subjected to 70.0 degrees C. The peak at 650 nm red-shifted and increased to reach 680 nm. A decrease at 945 nm is also visible for the damaged tissue with a preparation temperature of 70.0 degrees C as well as a slope variation in the range [800-900] nm. These results confirm the potential of using the hyperspectral camera to assess different levels of damage during thermal therapies encouraging additional studies to validate its use as a monitoring tool.;2022;10.1109/MEMEA54994.2022.9856522
C;In Vivo Fluorescence Hyperspectral Imaging of Oral Neoplasia;A hyperspectral imaging system using a liquid-crystal tunable filter (LCTF) was constructed for the purpose of in vivo optical imaging of oral neoplasia. The system operates in fluorescence mode and has the dual capability of capturing high quality widefield images and detecting fluorescence emission spectra from arbitrary locations within the captured field of view (FOV). The system was calibrated and evaluated for spectral resolution and accuracy. In vivo hyperspectral images were obtained from two normal volunteers and two patients with confirmed oral malignancy. Normal volunteer measurements revealed differences in intensity and lineshape of spectra between different anatomic locations, but intensity and lineshape were similar between different measurement sites from the same anatomic location. Measurements from normal and neoplastic areas of two patients with previously confirmed oral neoplasia showed differences in intensity, lineshape, and location of peak intensity. We have demonstrated that this system can provide both high quality widefield images, and spectral information at chosen locations within the field of view.;2009;10.1117/12.807226
J;Development of an image pre-processor for operational hyperspectral laryngeal cancer detection;Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a technology with high potential in the field of non-invasive detection of cancer. However, in complex imaging situations like HSI of the larynx with a rigid endoscope, various image interferences can disable a proper classification of cancerous tissue. We identified three main problems: i) misregistration of single images in a HS cube due to patient heartbeat ii) image noise and iii) specular reflections (SR). Consequently, an image pre-processor is developed in the current paper to overcome these image interferences. It encompasses i) image registration ii) noise removal by minimum noise fraction (MNF) transformation and iii) a novel SR detection method. The results reveal that the pre-processor improves classification performance, while the newly developed SR detection method outperforms global thresholding technique hitherto used by 46%. The novel pre-processor will be used for future studies towards the development of an operational scheme for HS-based larynx cancer detection.;2016;10.1002/jbio.201500151
J;Integrated Endoscopic System Based on Optical Imaging and Hyperspectral Data Analysis for Colorectal Cancer Detection;Background/Aim: Two-dimensional hyperspectral data systems with enhanced area detection and diagnostic abilities are now available in gastrointestinal endoscopy for colorectal cancer. We evaluated a new hyperspectral system for diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Patients and Methods: A resected-specimen spectrum observation module (stereoscopic macroscope, hyperspectral camera, and xenon lamp) was used to evaluate 21 resected colorectal cancer specimens (ex vivo experiment). A colonoscopy spectrum observation module (imaging fiberscope and hyperspectral camera) was used to perform 24 colonoscopic spectroscopy evaluations (in vivo experiment). Results: An approximately 525-nm increase in spectral absorption occurred between normal mucosa and adenoma, with a tendency toward decreased absorption rates with aggravation of other tumor types. In vivo discrimination between tumorous and non-tumorous tissues showed 72.5% sensitivity and 82.1% specificity. Conclusion: This in vivo hyperspectral diagnostic system showed that reflectance spectra intensity may discriminate between normal and abnormal colonic mucosa.;2016;
J;Hyperspectral imaging of gastrointestinal anastomoses;Anastomotic insufficiency (AI) remains the most feared surgical complication in gastrointestinal surgery, which is closely associated with a prolonged inpatient hospital stay and significant postoperative mortality. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a relatively new medical imaging procedure which has proven to be promising in tissue identification as well as in the analysis of tissue oxygenation and water content. Until now, no data exist on the in vivo HSI analysis of gastrointestinal anastomoses. Intraoperative images were obtained using the TIVITA (TM) tissue system HSI camera from Diaspective Vision GmbH (Pepelow, Germany). In 47 patients who underwent gastrointestinal surgery with esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, small bowel or colorectal anastomoses, 97 assessable recordings were generated. Parameters obtained at the sites of the anastomoses included tissue oxygenation (StO(2)), the tissue hemoglobin index (THI), near-infrared (NIR) perfusion index, and tissue water index (TWI). Obtaining and analyzing the intraoperative images with this non-invasive imaging system proved practicable and delivered good results on a consistent basis. A NIR gradient along and across the anastomosis was observed and, furthermore, analysis of the tissue water and oxygenation content showed specific changes at the site of anastomosis. The HSI method provides a non-contact, non-invasive, intraoperative imaging procedure without the use of a contrast medium, which enables a real-time analysis of physiological anastomotic parameters, which may contribute to determine the ideal anastomotic region. In light of this, the establishment of this methodology in the field of visceral surgery, enabling the generation of normal or cut off values for different gastrointestinal anastomotic types, is an obvious necessity.;2018;10.1007/s00104-018-0633-2
J;Hyperspectral imaging fluorescence excitation scanning for colon cancer detection;Optical spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging have shown the potential to discriminate between cancerous and noncancerous tissue with high sensitivity and specificity. However, to date, these techniques have not been effectively translated to real-time endoscope platforms. Hyperspectral imaging of the fluorescence excitation spectrum represents new technology that may be well suited for endoscopic implementation. However, the feasibility of detecting differences between normal and cancerous mucosa using fluorescence excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging has not been evaluated. The goal of this study was to evaluate the initial feasibility of using fluorescence excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging for measuring changes in fluorescence excitation spectrum concurrent with colonic adenocarcinoma using a small pre-pilot-scale sample size. Ex vivo analysis was performed using resected pairs of colorectal adenocarcinoma and normal mucosa. Adenocarcinoma was confirmed by histologic evaluation of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) permanent sections. Specimens were imaged using a custom hyperspectral imaging fluorescence excitation-scanning microscope system. Results demonstrated consistent spectral differences between normal and cancerous tissues over the fluorescence excitation range of 390 to 450 nm that could be the basis for wavelength-dependent detection of colorectal cancers. Hence, excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging may offer an alternative approach for discriminating adenocarcinoma from surrounding normal colonic mucosa, but further studies will be required to evaluate the accuracy of this approach using a larger patient cohort.

C;In vivo fluorescence and reflectance imaging of human cervical tissue;A hyperspectral imaging spectrograph has been used to measure the fluorescence and reflectance of cervical tissue in vivo. The instrument was employed in a clinical trial in Vilnius, Lithuania, where I I I patients were examined. The patients were initially screened by Pap smear, examined by colposcopy and a tissue sampling procedure was performed. Detailed histopathological assessments were performed on the biopsies, and these assessments were correlated with spectra and images. The results of the spectroscopic investigations show that different tissue types within one biopsy region exhibit different spectral signatures. A spectral analysis of the entire image localizes dysplastic regions in both fluorescence and reflectance, suggesting that the hyperspectral imaging technique is useful in the management of cervical malignancies.;2003;10.1117/12.480413
C;Hyperspectral VNIR and NIR Sensors for the Analysis of Human Normal Brain and Tumor Tissue;Hyperspectral (HS) imaging (HSI) is arising as a novel imaging technique to delineate brain tumor tissue in surgical-time. The accurate identification of the boundaries between tumor and normal tissue determines prolonged survival. In this work, a preliminary spectral analysis of different brain tissue was performed to identify features between different classes. A HSI dataset of in-vivo brain tissue was acquired by two HS cameras, covering the VNIR (Visual and Near-Infrared) [400-1000 nm] and NIR (Near-Infrared) [900-1700 nm] spectral ranges. Both HS images were registered using feature-based techniques with different geometric transformations to perform a spectral analysis of a certain pixel. Reflectance and absorbance spectral signatures were analyzed identifying spectral absorbance peaks related with hemoglobin and water. Finally, a statistical analysis was performed, where normal tissue (NT), tumor tissue (TT), and hypervascularized tissue (HT) were compared, obtaining highly statistically significance between HT-NT and HT-TT in both VNIR and NIR spectral ranges analyzed, and some no statistically significant differences between TT and NT in certain spectral ranges.;2021;10.1109/DCIS53048.2021.9666168
J;Over 1000 nm Near-Infrared Multispectral Imaging System for Laparoscopic In Vivo Imaging;In this study, a laparoscopic imaging device and a light source able to select wavelengths by bandpass filters were developed to perform multispectral imaging (MSI) using over 1000 nm near-infrared (OTN-NIR) on regions under a laparoscope. Subsequently, MSI (wavelengths: 1000-1400 nm) was performed using the built device on nine live mice before and after tumor implantation. The normal and tumor pixels captured within the mice were used as teaching data sets, and the tumor-implanted mice data were classified using a neural network applied following a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. The system provided a specificity of 89.5%, a sensitivity of 53.5%, and an accuracy of 87.8% for subcutaneous tumor discrimination. Aggregated true-positive (TP) pixels were confirmed in all tumor-implanted mice, which indicated that the laparoscopic OTN-NIR MSI could potentially be applied in vivo for classifying target lesions such as cancer in deep tissues.;2021;10.3390/s21082649
J;Multispectral fluorescence imaging of human ovarian and fallopian tube tissue for early-stage cancer detection;With early detection, 5-year survival rates for ovarian cancer exceed 90%, yet no effective early screening method exists. Emerging consensus suggests over 50% of the most lethal form of the disease originates in the fallopian tube. Twenty-eight women undergoing oophorectomy or debulking surgery provided informed consent for the use of surgical discard tissue samples for multispectral fluorescence imaging. Using multiple ultraviolet and visible excitation wavelengths and emissions bands, 12 fluorescence and 6 reflectance images of 47 ovarian and 31 fallopian tube tissue samples were recorded. After imaging, each sample was fixed, sectioned, and stained for pathological evaluation. Univariate logistic regression showed cancerous tissue samples had significantly lower intensity than noncancerous tissue for 17 image types. The predictive power of multiple image types was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression (MLR) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA). Two MLR models each using two image types had receiver operating characteristic curves with area under the curve exceeding 0.9. QDA determined 56 image type combinations with perfect resubstituting using as few as five image types. Adaption of the system for future in vivo fallopian tube and ovary endoscopic imaging is possible, which may enable sensitive detection of ovarian cancer with no exogenous contrast agents.

J;Characterisation of chemical damage on tissue structures by multispectral imaging and machine learning procedures: Alkaline hypochlorite effect in C. elegans;Multispectral imaging represents a powerful technique to maximise data collection and analysis for biological materials. It improves the exploitation and understanding of in vivo/vitro experiments. This work focused on testing the capability of multispectral imaging to characterise the tissue damage produced by alkaline hypochlorite on the body and eggs of the biological model C. elegans. To that end, three synchronisation processes with different final bleach and sodium hydroxide concentrations were performed. The impact of treatments was characterised by measuring egg viability and morphology, besides capturing multispectral images of both nematode bodies and eggs. Multispectral images consisted of seven slices captured from different wavelengths within the visible/infrared spectrum by different light-pass filters. The results showed dependence between increased alkaline hypochlorite concentration and loss of egg viability/morphology. This relation was also observed for the imaging data, which showed alterations to tissue transmittance for all the tested wavelengths for both bodies and eggs. Localised alterations related to alkaline hypochlorite diffusion through anatomical nematode orifices were recognised. Applying multivariate methods to imaging data successfully characterised tissue alterations, from which treatment type was predicted for both nematodes and eggs. Moreover, the alterations recorded by imaging data were also used to predict egg viability regardless of treatment type (0.94). The high correlation between the imaging data from nematodes and eggs with egg viability evidenced multispectral imaging's ability to characterise tissue damage and its possible practical application to study alterations to the tissues of this biological model.;2022;10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.105477
J;Multispectral image alignment using a three channel endoscope in vivo during minimally invasive surgery;Sequential multispectral imaging is an acquisition technique that involves collecting images of a target at different wavelengths, to compile a spectrum for each pixel. In surgical applications it suffers from low illumination levels and motion artefacts. A three-channel rigid endoscope system has been developed that allows simultaneous recording of stereoscopic and multispectral images. Salient features on the tissue surface may be tracked during the acquisition in the stereo cameras and, using multiple camera triangulation techniques, this information used to align the multispectral images automatically even though the tissue or camera is moving. This paper describes a detailed validation of the set-up in a controlled experiment before presenting the first in vivo use of the device in a porcine minimally invasive surgical procedure. Multispectral images of the large bowel were acquired and used to extract the relative concentration of haemoglobin in the tissue despite motion due to breathing during the acquisition. Using the stereoscopic information it was also possible to overlay the multispectral information on the reconstructed 3D surface. This experiment demonstrates the ability of this system for measuring blood perfusion changes in the tissue during surgery and its potential use as a platform for other sequential imaging modalities.

C;Hyperspectral Imaging Utilizing LCTF and DLP Technology for Surgical and Clinical Applications;"Two different, already characterized, hyperspectral imaging systems created for visualizing the spatial distribution of tissue oxygenation non-invasively for in vivo clinical use are described. Individual components of both liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF) and digital light processing (DLP) systems were characterized, calibrated, and found to be well within manufacturer specifications. Coupling LCTF with charge coupled device (CCD) technology and acquiring images at multiple, contiguous wavelengths and at narrow bandwidths are formatted into a hyperspectral data cube consisting of one spectral and two spatial dimensions. DLP (R) technology has the novel ability to conform light to any desired spectral illumination scheme. Subsequently the collected multispectral data are processed into chemically relevant images that are color encoded at each pixel detector for the relative percentage of oxyhemoglobin. Using spectral illumination methods unique to the DLP hyperspectral imager results in producing chemically relevant images at near video rate; 4 frames per second. As an example, both systems are used to collect spectral data from a 27.22 kg porcine kidney whose renal artery has been occluded for 60 minutes. Both systems return nearly identical spectra collected from the surface of the kidney, with a root mean square deviation between the two spectra of 0.02.";2009;10.1117/12.816279
C;Deformable Registration of Histological Cancer Margins to Gross Hyperspectral Images using Demons;Hyperspectral imaging (HSI), a non-contact optical imaging technique, has been recently used along with machine learning technique to provide diagnostic information about ex-vivo surgical specimens for optical biopsy. The computer-aided diagnostic approach requires accurate ground truths for both training and validation. This study details a processing pipeline for registering the cancer-normal margin from a digitized histological image to the gross-level HSI of a tissue specimen. Our work incorporates an initial affine and control-point registration followed by a deformable Demons-based registration of the moving mask obtained from the histological image to the fixed mask made from the HS image. To assess registration quality, Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) measures the image overlap, visual inspection is used to evaluate the margin, and average target registration error (TRE) of needle-bored holes measures the registration error between the histologic and HSI images. Excised tissue samples from seventeen patients, 11 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCCa) and 6 thyroid carcinoma, were registered according to the proposed method. Three registered specimens are illustrated in this paper, which demonstrate the efficacy of the registration workflow. Further work is required to apply the technique to more patient data and investigate the ability of this procedure to produce suitable gold standards for machine learning validation.;2018;10.1117/12.2293165
C;Multimodal imaging platform for surgical guidance during epilepsy surgery;Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by chronic excessive neuronal discharges. Epilepsy surgery may be considered in patients who are resistant to drug treatment, and several tests are used during pre-operative planning to locate the epileptic focus to be resected (MRI, PET, SPECT, EEG, MEG). In some cases, intracranial EEG monitoring or intraoperative electrocorticography is required to confirm and better delineate the area to be resected. Despite available tests, epilepsy surgery outcome remains modest. We present a multimodal imaging platform connected to a neurosurgical microscope allowing intraoperative detection of intrinsic optical brain biomarkers for surgical guidance during epilepsy surgery. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) allows detection of the hemodynamic response associated with epileptic activity, spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) is used for optical properties reconstruction (absorption and reduced scattering), and auto-fluorescence imaging (AFI) allows metabolic markers identification. Validation of SFDI and AFI systems was performed on optical phantoms. Acquisitions on ex vivo tissue samples demonstrate the capabilities of the system to produce fluorescence intensity maps, calibrated with optical properties obtained from SFDI to account for tissue attenuation. In vivo acquisition during epilepsy surgery with HSI allows characterization of the hemodynamic response associated with epileptic spikes.;2019;10.1117/12.2527232
C;Excitation-Scanning Hyperspectral Imaging System for Microscopic and Endoscopic Applications;Current microscopic and endoscopic technologies for cancer screening utilize white-light illumination sources. Hyper-spectral imaging has been shown to improve sensitivity while retaining specificity when compared to white-light imaging in both microscopy and in vivo imaging.(1'2) However, hyperspectral imaging methods have historically suffered from slow acquisition times due to the narrow bandwidth of spectral filters. Often minutes are required to gather a full image stack. We have developed a novel approach called excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging that provides 2-3 orders of magnitude increased signal strength. This reduces acquisition times significantly, allowing for live video acquisition. Here, we describe a preliminary prototype excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging system that can be coupled with endoscopes or microscopes for hyperspectral imaging of tissues and cells. Our system is comprised of three subsystems: illumination, transmission, and imaging. The illumination subsystem employs light-emitting diode arrays to illuminate at different wavelengths. The transmission subsystem utilizes a unique geometry of optics and a liquid light guide. Software controls allow us to interface with and control the subsystems and components. Digital and analog signals are used to coordinate wavelength intensity, cycling and camera triggering. Testing of the system shows it can cycle 16 wavelengths at as fast as 1 ms per cycle. Additionally, more than 18% of the light transmits through the system. Our setup should allow for hyperspectral imaging of tissue and cells in real time.;2016;10.1117/12.2213155
J;Multiplexing with multispectral imaging: From mice to microscopy;Increasing sophistication in the design and application of biological models as well as the advent of novel fluorescent probes have led to new demands on molecular imaging systems to deliver enhanced sensitivity, reliable quantitation, and the ability to resolve multiple simultaneous signals. Sensitivity is limited, especially in the visible spectral range, by the presence of ubiquitous autofluorescence signals (mostly arising from the skin and gut), which need to be separated from those of targeted fluorophores. Fluorescence-based imaging is also affected by absorbing and scattering properties of tissue in both the visible and to a lesser extent the near-infrared (NIR) regions. However, the small size of typical animal models (usually mice) often permits the detection of enough light arising even from relatively deep locations to allow the capture of signals with an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio. Multispectral imaging, through its ability to separate autofluorescence from label fluorescence, can increase sensitivity as much as 300 times compared to conventional approaches, and concomitantly improve quantitative accuracy. In the NIR region, autofluorescence, while still significant, poses less of a problem. However, the task of disentangling signals from multiple fluorophores remains. Multispectral imaging allows the separation of five or more fluorophores, with each signal quantitated and visualized separately. Preclinical small animal imaging is often accompanied by microscopic analysis, both before and after the in vivo phase. This can involve tissue culture manipulations and/or histological examination of fixed or frozen tissue. Due to the same advantages in sensitivity, quantitation, and multiplexing, microscopy-based multispectral techniques form an excellent complement to in vivo imaging.;2008;10.1093/ilar.49.1.78
J;An Intraoperative Visualization System Using Hyperspectral Imaging to Aid in Brain Tumor Delineation;Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) allows for the acquisition of large numbers of spectral bands throughout the electromagnetic spectrum (within and beyond the visual range) with respect to the surface of scenes captured by sensors. Using this information and a set of complex classification algorithms, it is possible to determine which material or substance is located in each pixel. The work presented in this paper aims to exploit the characteristics of HSI to develop a demonstrator capable of delineating tumor tissue from brain tissue during neurosurgical operations. Improved delineation of tumor boundaries is expected to improve the results of surgery. The developed demonstrator is composed of two hyperspectral cameras covering a spectral range of 400-1700 nm. Furthermore, a hardware accelerator connected to a control unit is used to speed up the hyperspectral brain cancer detection algorithm to achieve processing during the time of surgery. A labeled dataset comprised of more than 300,000 spectral signatures is used as the training dataset for the supervised stage of the classification algorithm. In this preliminary study, thematic maps obtained from a validation database of seven hyperspectral images of in vivo brain tissue captured and processed during neurosurgical operations demonstrate that the system is able to discriminate between normal and tumor tissue in the brain. The results can be provided during the surgical procedure (similar to 1 min), making it a practical system for neurosurgeons to use in the near future to improve excision and potentially improve patient outcomes.;2018;10.3390/s18020430
J;Automated segmentation of multispectral brain MR images;This work presents a robust and comprehensive approach for the in vivo automated segmentation and quantitative tissue volume measurement of normal brain composition from multispectral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Statistical pattern recognition methods based on a finite mixture model are used to partition the intracranial volume into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces. A masking algorithm initially extracts the brain volume from surrounding extrameningeal tissue. Radio frequency (RF) field inhomogeneity effects in the images are then removed using a recursive method that adapts to the intrinsic local tissue contrast. Our technique supports heterogeneous data with multispectral MR images of different contrast and intensity weighting acquired at varying spatial resolution and orientation. The proposed image segmentation methods have been tested using multispectral T1-, proton density-, and T2-weighted MRI data from young and aged non-human primates as well as from human subjects.

J;In vivo detection of head and neck tumors by hyperspectral imaging combined with deep learning methods;Currently, there are no fast and accurate screening methods available for head and neck cancer, the eighth most common tumor entity. For this study, we used hyperspectral imaging, an imaging technique for quantitative and objective surface analysis, combined with deep learning methods for automated tissue classification. As part of a prospective clinical observational study, hyperspectral datasets of laryngeal, hypopharyngeal and oropharyngeal mucosa were recorded in 98 patients before surgery in vivo. We established an automated data interpretation pathway that can classify the tissue into healthy and tumorous using convolutional neural networks with 2D spatial or 3D spatio-spectral convolutions combined with a state-of-the-art Densenet architecture. Using 24 patients for testing, our 3D spatio-spectral Densenet classification method achieves an average accuracy of 81%, a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 79%.;2022;10.1002/jbio.202100167
J;In Vitro and In Vivo Multispectral Photoacoustic Imaging for the Evaluation of Chromophore Concentration;"Multispectral photoacoustic imaging is a powerful noninvasive medical imaging technique that provides access to functional information. In this study, a set of methods is proposed and validated, with experimental multispectral photoacoustic images used to estimate the concentration of chromophores. The unmixing techniques used in this paper consist of two steps: (1) automatic extraction of the reference spectrum of each pure chromophore; and (2) abundance calculation of each pure chromophore from the estimated reference spectra. The compared strategies bring positivity and sum-to-one constraints, from the hyperspectral remote sensing field to multispectral photoacoustic, to evaluate chromophore concentration. Particularly, the study extracts the endmembers and compares the algorithms from the hyperspectral remote sensing domain and a dedicated algorithm for segmentation of multispectral photoacoustic data to this end. First, these strategies are tested with dilution and mixing of chromophores on colored 4% agar phantom data. Then, some preliminary in vivo experiments are performed. These consist of estimations of the oxygen saturation rate (sO(2)) in mouse tumors. This article proposes then a proof-of-concept of the interest to bring hyperspectral remote sensing algorithms to multispectral photoacoustic imaging for the estimation of chromophore concentration.";2021;10.3390/s21103366
C;Hyperspectral characterization of tissue in the SWIR spectral range - a road to new insight?;Hyperspectral imaging is a generic imaging modality allowing high spectral and spatial resolution over a wide wavelength range from the visible to mid-infrared. Short wavelength infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral imaging is currently becoming an important supplement to spectroscopy in optical diagnostics due to the flexibility and adaptability of the technique. However, due to the complexity of hyperspectral data, the analysis requires a well planned approach. In this paper a simple but effective approach combining dimension reduction and unsupervised classification is suggested. Examples of in vivo hyperspectral data in the SWIR spectral range (950-2500 nm) from human skin bruises and porcine skin burns are presented as examples. Data are processed using the minimum noise fraction transform (MNF), and K-means clustering. K-means clustering was found to perform significantly better if applied to MNF transformed data. The classification results agree well with biopsies, spectral data and visual inspection of injuries. It is thus shown that unsupervised clustering can be a preferable technique in cases where it is challenging to use or interpret results from physics based models, or where the ground truth is lacking or not well defined. The presented results confirm that SWIR hyperspectral imaging indeed is a useful tool for optical characterization of tissue.;2019;10.1117/12.2504297
C;Compressed hyperspectral Raman microscope for imaging tissues and cellular structures;Raman imaging continues to grow in popularity as a label-free technique for characterizing the underlying chemical structure of biological materials, both in-vitro and in-vivo. While Raman spectra demonstrate high chemical specificity, spontaneous Raman scattering is an inherently weak process and requires prohibitively long acquisition times. When Raman is utilized to image highly scattering cellular environments, integration times can be on the order of several minutes to hours. Recently developed compressed sensing techniques can greatly improve hyperspectral Raman acquisition times by randomly under-sampling the spatial dimensions. A digital micromirror device (DMD) is used to spatially encode the image plane. The encoded image is then propagated to a spectrometer where the spectral components are produced by shearing one spatial dimension. Several reconstruction algorithms have been developed that can then be used to return the original. Here, we will present single-shot, 2D Raman imaging of CHO cells using compressed hyperspectral Raman microscope. This system provides an order of magnitude improvement on traditional hyperspectral acquisition rates. Single-shot compressed hyperspectral Raman images can reveal biochemical changes due to short lifetime dynamic processes. These improvements will allow imaging of samples that metabolize quickly, rapidly oxidize, or are physically altered under experimental conditions.;2020;10.1117/12.2544571
C;Noninvasive inspection of skin lesions via multispectral imaging;An optical noninvasive inspection tool is presented to, in vivo, better characterize biological tissues such as human skin. The method proposed exploits a multispectral imaging device to acquire a set of images in the visible and NIR range. This kind of information can be very helpful to improve early diagnosis of melanoma, a very aggressive cutaneous neoplasm, incidence and mortality of which continues to rise worldwide. Currently, noninvasive methods (i.e. dermoscopy) have improved melanoma detection, but the definitive diagnosis is still achieved only by invasive method (istopathological observation of the excised lesion). The multispectral system we developed is capable of imaging layers of structures placed at increasing depth, thanks to the fact that light propagates into the skin and reaches different depths depending on its wavelength. This allows to image many features which are less or not visible in the clinical and dermoscopic examination. A new semeiotics is proposed to describe the content of multispectral images. Dermoscopic criteria can be easily applied to describe each image in the set, however inter-images correlations need new suitable descriptors. The first group of new parameters describes how the dermoscopic features, vary across the set of images. More aspects are then introduced. E. g. the longest wavelength where structures can be detected gives an estimate of the maximum depth reached by the pigmented lesion. While the presence of a bright-to-dark transition between the wavebands in the violet to blue range, reveals the presence of blue-whitish veil, which is a further malignancy marker.;2013;10.1117/12.2020577
J;Hyperspectral interventional imaging for enhanced tissue visualization and discrimination combining band selection methods;Hyperspectral imaging is an emerging technology recently introduced in medical applications inasmuch as it provides a powerful tool for noninvasive tissue characterization. In this context, a new system was designed to be easily integrated in the operating room in order to detect anatomical tissues hardly noticed by the surgeon's naked eye. Our LCTF-based spectral imaging system is operative over visible, near- and middle-infrared spectral ranges (400-1700 nm). It is dedicated to enhance critical biological tissues such as the ureter and the facial nerve. We aim to find the best three relevant bands to create a RGB image to display during the intervention with maximal contrast between the target tissue and its surroundings. A comparative study is carried out between band selection methods and band transformation methods. Combined band selection methods are proposed. All methods are compared using different evaluation criteria. Experimental results show that the proposed combined band selection methods provide the best performance with rich information, high tissue separability and short computational time. These methods yield a significant discrimination between biological tissues. We developed a hyperspectral imaging system in order to enhance some biological tissue visualization. The proposed methods provided an acceptable trade-off between the evaluation criteria especially in SWIR spectral band that outperforms the naked eye's capacities.;2016;10.1007/s11548-016-1449-5
J;Video: Clinical evaluation of a laparoscopic hyperspectral imaging system;Background Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) during surgical procedures is a new method for perfusion quantification and tissue discrimination. Its use has been limited to open surgery due to large camera sizes, missing color video, or long acquisition times. A hand-held, laparoscopic hyperspectral camera has been developed now to overcome those disadvantages and evaluated clinically for the first time. Methods In a clinical evaluation study, gastrointestinal resectates of ten cancer patients were investigated using the laparoscopic hyperspectral camera. Reference data from corresponding anatomical regions were acquired with a clinically approved HSI system. An image registration process was executed that allowed for pixel-wise comparisons of spectral data and parameter images (StO(2): oxygen saturation of tissue, NIR PI: near-infrared perfusion index, OHI: organ hemoglobin index, TWI: tissue water index) provided by both camera systems. The mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) served for the quantitative evaluations. Spearman's rank correlation between factors related to the study design like the time of spectral white balancing and MAE, respectively RMSE, was calculated. Results The obtained mean MAEs between the TIVITA (R) Tissue and the laparoscopic hyperspectral system resulted in StO(2): 11% +/- 7%, NIR PI: 14 +/- 3, OHI: 14 +/- 5, and TWI: 10 +/- 2. The mean RMSE between both systems was 0.1 +/- 0.03 from 500 to 750 nm and 0.15 +/- 0.06 from 750 to 1000 nm. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients showed no significant correlation between MAE or RMSE and influencing factors related to the study design. Conclusion Qualitatively, parameter images of the laparoscopic system corresponded to those of the system for open surgery. Quantitative deviations were attributed to technical differences rather than the study design. Limitations of the presented study are addressed in current large-scale in vivo trials.;2022;10.1007/s00464-022-09282-y
J;Imaging perfusion changes in oncological clinical applications by hyperspectral imaging: a literature review;Background. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a promising imaging modality that uses visible light to obtain information about blood flow. It has the distinct advantage of being noncontact, nonionizing, and noninvasive without the need for a contrast agent. Among the many applications of HSI in the medical field are the detection of various types of tumors and the evaluation of their blood flow, as well as the healing processes of grafts and wounds. Since tumor perfusion is one of the critical factors in oncology, we assessed the value of HSI in quantifying perfusion changes during interventions in clinical oncology through a systematic review of the literature. Materials and methods. The PubMed and Web of Science electronic databases were searched using the terms hyperspectral imaging perfusion cancer  and hyperspectral imaging resection cancer . The inclusion criterion was the use of HSI in clinical oncology, meaning that all animal, phantom, ex vivo, experimental, research and development, and purely methodological studies were excluded. Results. Twenty articles met the inclusion criteria. The anatomic locations of the neoplasms in the selected articles were as follows: kidneys (1 article), breasts (2 articles), eye (1 article), brain (4 articles), entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract (1 article), upper GI tract (5 articles), and lower GI tract (6 articles). Conclusions. HSI is a potentially attractive imaging modality for clinical application in oncology, with assessment of mastectomy skin flap perfusion after reconstructive breast surgery and anastomotic perfusion during reconstruction of gastrointenstinal conduit as the most promising at present.;2022;10.2478/raon-2022-0051
C;Hyperspectral imaging of ischemic wounds;Optical imaging has the potential to achieve high spatial resolution and high functional sensitivity in wound assessment. However, clinical acceptance of many optical imaging devices is hampered by poor reproducibility, low accuracy, and lack of biological interpretation. We developed an in vivo model of ischemic flap for non-contact assessment of wound tissue functional parameters and spectral characteristics. The model was created by elevating the bipedicle skin flaps of a domestic pig from the underlying vascular bed and inhibiting graft bed reperfusion by a silastic sheet. Hyperspectral imaging was carried out on the ischemic flap model and compared with transcutaneous oxygen tension and perfusion measurements at different positions of the wound. Hyperspectral images have also been captured continuously during a post-occlusive reactive hyperemia (PORH) procedure. Tissue spectral characteristics obtained by hyperspectral imaging correlated well with cutaneous tissue oxygen tension, blood perfusion, and microscopic changes of tissue morphology. Our experiments not only demonstrated the technical feasibility for quantitative assessment of chronic wound but also provided a potential digital phantom platform for quantitative characterization and calibration of medical optical devices.;2012;10.1117/12.907107
J;Custom optical imaging system for ex-vivo breast cancer detection based on spectral signature;Background and purpose: Breast cancer is a popular well-known tumor in women globally and the subsequent driving reason for malignancy death. The purpose of the present study is to develop Low cost, commercial, and affordable system that discriminates malignant from normal breast tissues by exploiting the unique properties of Hyperspectral (HS) Imaging. Materials and methods: The difference in the optical properties of the investigated breast tissues gives various reactions to light transmission, absorption, and especially the reflection over the spectral range. A custom optical imaging system (COIS) was designed to assess variable responses to monochromatic LEDs (415, 565, 660 nm) to highlight the differences in the reflectance properties of malignant/normal tissue. Statistical analysis was computed for determining the ideal wavelength to differentiate between normal and malignant regions. The experiment was repeated using the same LEDs, and low-cost CCD camera to examine the capability of such a system to discriminate between normal and malignant tissue. Results: Spectral images obtained by Hyperspectral camera, have been analyzed to reveal the difference of reflectance malignant and normal breast tissue. Superficial spectral reflection image with blue LED (415 nm) showed high variance (10.11). However, a more-depth reflection image with red LED (660 nm) showed low variance (4.44). So the optimum contrast image was produced by combining the three spectral information images from blue, green, and red LED. The COIS using a commercial CCD camera was in agreement with the HS camera. Conclusions: The novel COIS of the commercial Low-cost CCD Camera is reliable and can be used with endoscopy technique as an assistant tool for surgical doctor to make decision and assess the resection edges in real time during surgery.;2020;10.1016/j.suronc.2020.10.019
C;Cancer Detection Using Hyperspectral Imaging and Evaluation of the Superficial Tumor Margin Variance with Depth;Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCCa) is primarily managed by surgical resection. Recurrence rates after surgery can be as high as 55% if residual cancer is present. In this study, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is evaluated for detection of SCCa in ex-vivo surgical specimens. Several methods are investigated, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a spectral-spatial variant of support vector machines. Quantitative results demonstrate that additional processing and unsupervised filtering can improve CNN results to achieve optimal performance. Classifying regions that include specular glare, the average AUC is increased from 0.73 [0.71, 0.75 (95% confidence interval)] to 0.81 [0.80, 0.83] through an unsupervised filtering and majority voting method described. The wavelengths of light used in HSI can penetrate different depths into biological tissue, while the cancer margin may change with depth and create uncertainty in the ground-truth. Through serial histological sectioning, the variance in cancer-margin with depth is also investigated and paired with qualitative classification heat maps using the methods proposed for the testing group SCC patients.;2019;10.1117/12.2512985
J;Target-to-background enhancement in multispectral endoscopy with background autofluorescence mitigation for quantitative molecular imaging;Fluorescence molecular imaging with exogenous probes improves specificity for the detection of diseased tissues by targeting unambiguous molecular signatures. Additionally, increased diagnostic sensitivity is expected with the application of multiple molecular probes. We developed a real-time multispectral fluorescence-reflectance scanning fiber endoscope (SFE) for wide-field molecular imaging of fluorescent dye-labeled molecular probes at nanomolar detection levels. Concurrent multichannel imaging with the wide-field SFE also allows for real-time mitigation of the background autofluorescence (AF) signal, especially when fluorescein, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved dye, is used as the target fluorophore. Quantitative tissue AF was measured for the ex vivo porcine esophagus and murine brain tissues across the visible and near-infrared spectra. AF signals were then transferred to the unit of targeted fluorophore concentration to evaluate the SFE detection sensitivity for sodium fluorescein and cyanine. Next, we demonstrated a real-time AF mitigation algorithm on a tissue phantom, which featured molecular probe targeted cells of high-grade dysplasia on a substrate containing AF species. The target-to-background ratio was enhanced by more than one order of magnitude when applying the real-time AF mitigation algorithm. Furthermore, a quantitative estimate of the fluorescein photodegradation (photobleaching) rate was evaluated and shown to be insignificant under the illumination conditions of SFE. In summary, the multichannel laser-based flexible SFE has demonstrated the capability to provide sufficient detection sensitivity, image contrast, and quantitative target intensity information for detecting small precancerous lesions in vivo.

J;Multiview hyperspectral topography of tissue structural and functional characteristics;Accurate and in vivo characterization of structural, functional, and molecular characteristics of biological tissue will facilitate quantitative diagnosis, therapeutic guidance, and outcome assessment in many clinical applications, such as wound healing, cancer surgery, and organ transplantation. We introduced and tested a multiview hyperspectral imaging technique for noninvasive topographic imaging of cutaneous wound oxygenation. The technique integrated a multiview module and a hyperspectral module in a single portable unit. Four plane mirrors were cohered to form a multiview reflective mirror set with a rectangular cross section. The mirror set was placed between a hyperspectral camera and the target biological tissue. For a single image acquisition task, a hyperspectral data cube with five views was obtained. The five-view hyperspectral image consisted of a main objective image and four reflective images. Three-dimensional (3-D) topography of the scene was achieved by correl mating the matching pixels between the objective image and the reflective images. 3-Dapping of tissue oxygenation was achieved using a hyperspectral oxygenation algorithm. The multiview hyperspectral imaging technique was validated in a wound model, a tissue-simulating blood phantom, and in vivo biological tissue. The experimental results demonstrated the technical feasibility of using multiview hyperspectral imaging for 3-D topography of tissue functional properties. (C) The Authors.

C;Dual plasmonic gold nanoparticles for multispectral photoacoustic imaging application;Nanoparticle contrast agents for molecular targeted imaging have widespread interest in diagnostic applications with cellular resolution, specificity and selectivity for visualization and assessment of various disease processes. Of particular interest is gold nanoparticle owing to its tunability of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and its relative inertness. Here we present the synthesis of anisotropic multi-branched star shaped gold nanoparticles exhibiting dual-band plasmon absorption peaks and its application as a contrast agent for multispectral photoacoustic imaging. The transverse plasmon absorption peak of the synthesised dual plasmonic gold nanostar (DPGNS) was around 700 nm and that of longitudinal plasmon absorption in the longer wavelength region around 1050-1150 nm. Unlike most reported PA contrast agent with surface plasmon absorption in the range of 700 to 800 nm showing moderate tissue penetration, 1050-1200 nm range lies in the farther region of the optical window of biological tissue where scattering and the intrinsic optical extinction of endogenous chromophores is at its minimum. We also present a proof of principle demonstration of DPGNS as contrast agent for multispectral photoacoustic animal imaging. Our results show that DPGNS are promising for PA imaging with extended-depth imaging applications.;2014;10.1117/12.2042079
C;Applications and assessment of an excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging system;The majority of microscopic and endoscopic technologies utilize white light illumination For a number of applications, hyper-spectral imaging can be shown to have significant improvements over standard white-light imaging techniques. This is true for both microscopy and in vivo imaging. However, hyperspectral imaging methods have suffered from slow application times. Often, minutes are required to gather a full imaging stack. Here we will describe and evaluate a novel excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging system and discuss some applications. We have developed and are optimizing a novel approach called excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging that provides an order of magnitude increased signal strength. This excitation scanning technique has enabled us to produce a microscopy system capable of high speed hyperspectral imaging with the potential for live video acquisition. The excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging technology we developed may impact a range of applications. The current design uses digital strobing to illuminate at 16 wavelengths with millisecond image acquisition time. Analog intensity control enables a fully customizable excitation profile. A significant advantage of excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging is can identify multiple targets simultaneously in real time. Finally, we are exploring utilizing this technology for a variety of applications ranging from measuring cAMP distribution in three dimensions within a cell to electrophysiology.;2018;10.1117/12.2290120
J;Optical hyperspectral imaging in microscopy and spectroscopy - a review of data acquisition;Rather than simply acting as a photographic camera capturing two-dimensional (x, y) intensity images or a spectrometer acquiring spectra (lambda), a hyperspectral imager measures entire three-dimensional (x, y, lambda) datacubes for multivariate analysis, providing structural, molecular, and functional information about biological cells or tissue with unprecedented detail. Such data also gives clinical insights for disease diagnosis and treatment. We summarize the principles underpinning this technology, highlight its practical implementation, and discuss its recent applications at microscopic to macroscopic scales.;2015;10.1002/jbio.201400051
J;Intraoperative Multispectral Fluorescence Imaging for the Detection of the Sentinel Lymph Node in Cervical Cancer: A Novel Concept;"Real-time intraoperative near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging is a promising technique for lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection. The purpose of this technical feasibility pilot study was to evaluate the applicability of NIRF imaging with indocyanin green (ICG) for the detection of the SLN in cervical cancer. In ten patients with early stage cervical cancer, a mixture of patent blue and ICG was injected into the cervix uteri during surgery. Real-time color and fluorescence videos and images were acquired using a custom-made multispectral fluorescence camera system. Real-time fluorescence lymphatic mapping was observed in vivo in six patients; a total of nine SLNs were detected, of which one (11%) contained metastases. Ex vivo fluorescence imaging revealed the remaining fluorescent signal in 11 of 197 non-sentinel LNs (5%), of which one contained metastatic tumor tissue. None of the non-fluorescent LNs contained metastases. We conclude that lymphatic mapping and detection of the SLN in cervical cancer using intraoperative NIRF imaging is technically feasible. However, the technique needs to be refined for full applicability in cervical cancer in terms of sensitivity and specificity.";2011;10.1007/s11307-010-0425-7
J;Hyperspectral and multispectral bioluminescence optical tomography for small animal imaging;For bioluminescence imaging studies in small animals, it is important to be able to accurately localize the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of the underlying bioluminescent source. The spectrum of light produced by the source that escapes the subject varies with the depth of the emission source because of the wavelength-dependence of the optical properties of tissue. Consequently, multispectral or hyperspectral data acquisition should help in the 3D localization of deep sources. In this paper, we describe a framework for fully 3D bioluminescence tomographic image acquisition and reconstruction that exploits spectral information. We describe regularized tomographic reconstruction techniques that use semi-infinite slab or FEM-based diffusion approximations of photon transport through turbid media. Singular value decomposition analysis was used for data dimensionality reduction and to illustrate the advantage of using hyperspectral rather than achromatic data. Simulation studies in an atlas-mouse geometry indicated that sub-millimeter resolution may be attainable given accurate knowledge of the optical properties of the animal. A fixed arrangement of mirrors and a single CCD camera were used for simultaneous acquisition of multispectral imaging data over most of the surface of the animal. Phantom studies conducted using this system demonstrated our ability to accurately localize deep point-like sources and show that a resolution of 1.5 to 2.2 mm for depths up to 6 mm can be achieved. We also include an in vivo study of a mouse with a brain tumour expressing firefly luciferase. Co-registration of the reconstructed 3D bioluminescent image with magnetic resonance images indicated good anatomical localization of the turnout.;2005;10.1088/0031-9155/50/23/001
J;Spatiospectral denoising framework for multispectral optoacoustic imaging based on sparse signal representation;Purpose: One of the major challenges in dynamic multispectral optoacoustic imaging is its relatively low signal-to-noise ratio which often requires repetitive signal acquisition and averaging, thus limiting imaging rate. The development of denoising methods which prevent the need for signal averaging in time presents an important goal for advancing the dynamic capabilities of the technology. Methods: In this paper, a denoising method is developed for multispectral optoacoustic imaging which exploits the implicit sparsity of multispectral optoacoustic signals both in space and in spectrum. Noise suppression is achieved by applying thresholding on a combined wavelet-Karhunen-Loeve representation in which multispectral optoacoustic signals appear particularly sparse. The method is based on inherent characteristics of multispectral optoacoustic signals of tissues, offering promise for general application in different incarnations of multispectral optoacoustic systems. Results: The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on mouse images acquired in vivo for two common additive noise sources: time-varying parasitic signals and white noise. In both cases, the proposed method shows considerable improvement in image quality in comparison to previously published denoising strategies that do not consider multispectral information. Conclusions: The suggested denoising methodology can achieve noise suppression with minimal signal loss and considerably outperforms previously proposed denoising strategies, holding promise for advancing the dynamic capabilities of multispectral optoacoustic imaging while retaining image quality.

C;Analysis of spatial variability in hyperspectral imagery of the uterine cervix in vivo;The use of fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy in the analysis of cervical histopathology is a growing field of research. The majority of this research is performed with point-like probes. Typically, clinicians select probe sites visually, collecting a handful of spectral samples. An exception to this methodology is the Hyperspectral Diagnostic Imaging (HSDI(R)) instrument developed by Science and Technology International. This non-invasive device collects contiguous hyperspectral images across the entire cervical portio. The high spatial and spectral resolution of the HSDI instruments make them uniquely well suited for addressing the-issues of coupled spatial and spectral variability of tissues in vivo. Analysis of HSDI data indicates that tissue spectra vary from point to point, even within histopathologically homogeneous regions. This spectral variability exhibits both random and patterned components, implying that point monitoring may be susceptible to significant sources of noise and clutter inherent in the tissue. We have analyzed HSDI images from clinical CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) patients to quantify the spatial variability of fluorescence and reflectance spectra. This analysis shows the spatial structure of images to be fractal in nature, in both intensity and spectrum. These fractal tissue textures will limit the performance of any point-monitoring technology.;2003;10.1117/12.479509
J;Surgical spectral imaging;Recent technological developments have resulted in the availability of miniaturised spectral imaging sensors capable of operating in the multi- (MSI) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) regimes. Simultaneous advances in image-processing techniques and artificial intelligence (AI), especially in machine learning and deep learning, have made these data-rich modalities highly attractive as a means of extracting biological information non-destructively. Surgery in particular is poised to benefit from this, as spectrally-resolved tissue optical properties can offer enhanced contrast as well as diagnostic and guidance information during interventions. This is particularly relevant for procedures where inherent contrast is low under standard white light visualisation. This review summarises recent work in surgical spectral imaging (SSI) techniques, taken from Pubmed, Google Scholar and arXiv searches spanning the period 2013-2019. New hardware, optimised for use in both open and minimally-invasive surgery (MIS), is described, and recent commercial activity is summarised. Computational approaches to extract spectral information from conventional colour images are reviewed, as tip-mounted cameras become more commonplace in MIS. Model-based and machine learning methods of data analysis are discussed in addition to simulation, phantom and clinical validation experiments. A wide variety of surgical pilot studies are reported but it is apparent that further work is needed to quantify the clinical value of MSI/HSI. The current trend toward data-driven analysis emphasises the importance of widely-available, standardised spectral imaging datasets, which will aid understanding of variability across organs and patients, and drive clinical translation.

C;Tumor Margin Classification of Head and Neck Cancer Using Hyperspectral Imaging and Convolutional Neural Networks;One of the largest factors affecting disease recurrence after surgical cancer resection is negative surgical margins. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an optical imaging technique with potential to serve as a computer aided diagnostic tool for identifying cancer in gross ex-vivo specimens. We developed a tissue classifier using three distinct convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures on HSI data to investigate the ability to classify the cancer margins from ex-vivo human surgical specimens, collected from 20 patients undergoing surgical cancer resection as a preliminary validation group. A new approach for generating the HSI ground truth using a registered histological cancer margin is applied in order to create a validation dataset. The CNN-based method classifies the tumor-normal margin of squamous cell carcinoma (SCCa) versus normal oral tissue with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 for inter-patient validation, performing with 81% accuracy, 84% sensitivity, and 77% specificity. Thyroid carcinoma cancer-normal margins are classified with an AUC of 0.94 for inter-patient validation, performing with 90% accuracy, 91% sensitivity, and 88% specificity. Our preliminary results on a limited patient dataset demonstrate the predictive ability of HSI-based cancer margin detection, which warrants further investigation with more patient data and additional processing techniques to optimize the proposed deep learning method.;2018;10.1117/12.2293167
C;Optimal Feature Selection Applied to Multispectral Fluorescence Imaging;Recent rapid developments in multi-model optical imaging have created a significant clinical demand for its in vivo - in situ application. This offers the potential for real-time tissue characterization, functional assessment, and intra-operative guidance. One of the key requirements for in vivo consideration is to minimise the acquisition window to avoid tissue motion and deformation, whilst making the best use of Hie available photons to account for correlation or redundancy between different dimensions. The purpose of this paper is to propose a, feature selection framework to identify the best combination of features for discriminating between different tissue classes such that redundant or irrelevant information can be avoided during data acquisition. The method is based on a Bayesian framework for feature selection by using the receiver operating characteristic curves to determine the most pertinent data to capture. This represents a general technique that can be applied to different multi-modal imaging modalities and initial results. derived from phantom and ex vivo tissue experiments demonstrate the potential clinical value of the technique.;2008;
C;Deep learning based automatic detection, and localization of cancer region using multispectral photoacoustic imaging;Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) has the potential to detect cancer in the early stage. PAI is safe due to its non-ionizing radiation properties, which greatly enhance its clinical feasibility in the near future, which provides significant benefits over other imaging techniques like X-ray computed tomography (CT). In this paper, the fully automated 3D deep learning cancer detector is taken to detect and localize the presence of cancer in freshly excised ex-vivo human thyroid and prostate tissue specimens using a three-dimensional (3D) multispectral photoacoustic (MPA) dataset automatically. The model detected and localized the cancer region in a given test MPA image with promising results.;2022;10.1117/12.2603338
J;Multi-scale hyperspectral imaging of cervical neoplasia;This preliminary study aimed at investigating the feasibility and effective of multi-scale hyperspectral imaging in detecting cervical neoplasia at both tissue and cellular levels. In this paper, we describe a noninvasive diagnosis method with a hyperspectral imager for detection and location of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) at multiple scales. At the macroscopic level, the hyperspectral imager was applied to capture the reflectance images of the entire cervix in vivo at a series of wavelengths. At the microscopic level, the hyperspectral imager was coupled with a microscope to collect the transmittance images of the pathological slide. The collected image data were calibrated. A wide-gap second derivative analysis was applied to differentiate CIN from other types of tissue. At both macroscopic and microscopic levels, hyperspectral imaging analysis results were consistent with those of histopathological analysis, indicating the technical feasibility of multi-scale hyperspectral imaging for cervical neoplasia detection with accuracy and efficacy. We propose a multi-scale hyperspectral imaging method for noninvasive detection of cervical neoplasia. Comparison of the imaging results with those of gold standard histologic measurements demonstrates that the hyperspectral diagnostic imaging system can distinguish CIN at both tissue and cellular levels.;2016;10.1007/s00404-015-3906-8
C;Towards Multispectral Endoscopic Imaging for Cardiac Lesion Assessment and Classification for Cardiac Ablation Therapy;Pulmonary vein (PV) isolation is a critical procedure for the treatment and termination of atrial fibrillation (AF). The success of such treatment depends on the extent of tissue damage, where partial lesions can allow abnormal electrical conduction and risk relapse of AF. Proper evaluation of lesion delivery and ablation line continuity remains challenging with current techniques and in part limit procedural efficacy. A tool for direct visualization of endo-myocardial lesions in vivo could potentially reduce ambiguity in treatment location and extent and improve the overall fidelity of lesion sets. In this work, we introduce a method for wide-field visualization of myocardial tissue including the discernment of ablated and non-ablated regions using an endoscopic multispectral imaging system (EMIS). The system was designed to fit the working channel of most commercial sheathes (<4 Fr) and supported quadruple-wavelength reflectance imaging through a flexible fiber-bundle. A total of 50 endocardial lesions were created and imaged on nine swine hearts, ex vivo in addition to 15 lesions on human LA samples near PV regions. A pixel-wise linear discriminant analysis algorithm was developed to classify regions of ablation treatment based on calibrated EMI maps. Results show good agreement of treatment severity and spatial extent compared to post-hoc tissue vital staining;2018;10.1117/12.2292583
J;Contrast-Enhanced Multispectral Photoacoustic Imaging for Irregular Hepatectomy Navigation: A Pilot Study;Irregular hepatectomy plays a prominent role in the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with severe cirrhosis and localized liver metastasis. In clinical practices, intraoperative tumor boundaries delineation facilitates to accomplish tumor resection with negative margin, remarkably decreasing the recurrence rates. Currently, ultrasound (US) and ICG fluorescence-guided surgery has been used for intraoperative navigation in irregular hepatectomy, but insufficient specificity results in a limited prevalence. Inspired by the resolution of photoacoustic (PA) imaging and established clinical efficacy of F-18-Alfatide that is specific for integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-overexpressed tumors, we herein developed a fluorescent analogue IR820-E[c(RGDfK)](2), and a proof-of-concept intraoperative multispectral PA imaging navigation for precise irregular hepatectomy using hand-held PA/US imaging system. An integrin alpha(v)beta(3) targeted fluorescent contrast agent IR820-E[c(RGDfK)](2), was designed, synthesized, and characterized. In vitro studies were performed to determine optical and PA properties, affinity and specificity and biocompatibility. Multispectral PA imaging, the optimal imaging time point and contrast, multispectral PA imaging-guided irregular hepatectomy, pharmacokinetics, and safety profile were evaluated in subcutaneous and orthotopic HCC tumor models. Ex vivo macroscopic three-dimensions (3D) PA imaging with IR820-E[c(RGDfK)] 2 staining was also performed in surgical biospecimens from patients with HCC. IR820-E[c(RGDfK)](2) has a simple synthetic method at gram scale, high affinity, and specificity for integrin alpha(v)beta(3), excellent pharmacokinetic and safety profile can effectively differentiate tumor from normal liver tissues in animal models and surgical biospecimens from HCC patients. Preoperative tumor localization, intraoperative tumor boundaries delineation, and tumor excision, and postoperative negative margin assessment were successfully achieved during irregular hepatectomy. This initial attempt allows one to preoperatively detect tumor lesions, intraoperatively delineate tumor boundaries and guide tumor resection, and postoperatively evaluate tumor margin status during irregular hepatectomy. IR820-E[c(RGDfK)](2) has the potential to be an investigational new drug for clinical use in multispectral photoacoustic imaging-guided irregular hepatectomy.;2020;10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c00921
J;Simultaneous Evaluation of Cerebral Hemodynamics and Light Scattering Properties of the In Vivo Rat Brain Using Multispectral Diffuse Reflectance Imaging;The simultaneous evaluation of cerebral hemodynamics and the light scattering properties of in vivo rat brain tissue is demonstrated using a conventional multispectral diffuse reflectance imaging system. This system is constructed from a broadband white light source, a motorized filter wheel with a set of narrowband interference filters, a light guide, a collecting lens, a video zoom lens, and a monochromatic charged-coupled device (CCD) camera. An ellipsoidal cranial window is made in the skull bone of a rat under isoflurane anesthesia to capture in vivo multispectral diffuse reflectance images of the cortical surface. Regulation of the fraction of inspired oxygen using a gas mixture device enables the induction of different respiratory states such as normoxia, hyperoxia, and anoxia. A Monte Carlo simulation-based multiple regression analysis for the measured multispectral diffuse reflectance images at nine wavelengths (500, 520, 540, 560, 570, 580, 600, 730, and 760 nm) is then performed to visualize the two-dimensional maps of hemodynamics and the light scattering properties of the in vivo rat brain.;2017;10.3791/55399
J;Quantitative, real-time in vivo tracking of magnetic nanoparticles using multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging;"The goal of this work was to demonstrate real-time tracking of in vivo nanoparticle concentrations utilizing multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT). Combining the high contrast of optical imaging with the high resolution of ultrasound imaging, MSOT was utilized for non-invasive, real-time tomographic imaging of particles in mice and the results calibrated against analysis of tissue samples with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. In a longitudinal study, the pharmacokinetics (pK) and biodistribution of Cyanine-7 (Cy7) conjugated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (Cy7-SPIONs) were monitored after intravenous administration into the tail vein of healthy B6-albino mice. Concentrations of Cy7-SPION5 determined by MSOT image analysis of the liver, spleen, and kidneys showed excellent agreement with EPR data obtained on tissue samples - validating MSOT's ability to quantify SPION concentrations with high spatial resolution. Both methods of analysis indicated highest accumulation of Cy7-SPION5 in the liver followed by the spleen, and negligible accumulation in the kidneys; SPION accumulation in organs with high concentrations of mononuclear phagocytic system macrophages is typical. Additionally, our study observed that particles modified with a 2 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) demonstrated significantly prolonged half-life in circulation compared to particles with 5 kDa PEG. The study demonstrates the potential of Cy7-SPIONs and MSOT for quantitative localization of magnetic nanoparticles in vivo, which can potentially be used to study their toxicity, quantify the efficacy of targeted drug delivery (e.g. within tumors), and their use as a multi-modal diagnostic agent to monitor disease progression.

J;Multispectral imaging in biology and medicine: Slices of life;Multispectral imaging (MSI) is currently in a period of transition from its role as an exotic technique to its being offered in one form or another by all the major microscopy manufacturers. This is because it provides solutions to some of the major challenges in fluorescence-based imaging, namely ameliorating the consequences of the presence of autofluorescence and the need to easily accommodate relatively high levels of signal multiplexing. MSI, which spectrally characterizes and computationally eliminates autofluorescence, enhances the signal-to-background dramatically, revealing otherwise obscured targets. While this article concentrates on examples derived from liquid-crystal tunable filter-based technology, the intent is to showcase the advantages of multispectral imaging in general. Some technologies used to generate multispectral images are compatible with only particular optical configurations, such as point-scanning laser confocal microscopy. Band-sequential approaches, such as those afforded by liquid-crystal tunable filters (LCTFs), can be conveniently coupled with a variety of imaging modalities, which, in addition to fluorescence microscopy, include brightfield (nonfluorescent) microscopy as well as small-animal, noninvasive in-vivo imaging. Brightfield microscopy is the chosen format for histopathology, which relies on immunohistochemistry to provide molecularly resolved clinical information. However, in contrast to fluorescent labels, multiple chromogens, if they spatially overlap, are much harder to separate and quantitate, unless MSI approaches are used. In-vivo imaging is a rapidly growing field with applications in basic biology, drug discovery, and clinical medicine. The sensitivity of fluorescence-based in-vivo imaging, as with fluorescence microscopy, can be limited by the presence of significant autofluorescence, a limitation which can be overcome through the utilization of MSI.

J;Review on Multispectral Photoacoustic Analysis of Cancer: Thyroid and Breast;In recent decades, photoacoustic imaging has been used widely in biomedical research, providing molecular and functional information from biological tissues in vivo. In addition to being used for research in small animals, photoacoustic imaging has also been utilized for in vivo human studies, achieving a multispectral photoacoustic response in deep tissue. There have been several clinical trials for screening cancer patients by analyzing multispectral responses, which in turn provide metabolomic information about the underlying biological tissues. This review summarizes the methods and results of clinical photoacoustic trials available in the literature to date to classify cancerous tissues, specifically of the thyroid and breast. From the review, we can conclude that a great potential exists for photoacoustic imaging to be used as a complementary modality to improve diagnostic accuracy for suspicious tumors, thus significantly benefitting patients' healthcare.;2022;10.3390/metabo12050382
J;Quantification of tumor tissue populations by multispectral analysis;Tumor heterogeneity complicates the quantification of a therapeutic response by MRI. To address this issue, a novel approach has been developed that combines MR diffusion imaging with multispectral (MS) analysis to quantify tumor tissue populations. K-means (KM) clustering of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), T-2, and proton density (M-o) was employed to estimate the volumes of viable tumor tissue, necrosis, and neighboring subcutaneous adipose tissue in a human colorectal tumor xenograft mouse model. In a second set of experiments, the temporal evolution of the MS tissue classes in response to therapeutic intervention Apo2L/TRAIL and CPT-11 was observed. The multiple parameters played complementary roles in identifying the various tissues. The ADC was the dominant parameter for identifying regions of necrosis, whereas T-2 identified two necrotic subpopulations, and M-o contributed to the differentiation of viable tumor from subcutaneous adipose tissue. MS viable tumor estimates (mean volume = 275 +/- 147 mm(3)) were highly correlated (r = 0.81, P < 0.01) with histological estimates (1117 +/- 51 mm). In the treatment study, MS viable tumor volume (at day 10) was 77 +/- 67 mm(3) for the Apo2L/TRAIL+CPT-11 group, and was significantly reduced relative to the control group (292 +/- 127 mm(3), p < 0.01). This method shows promise as a means of detecting an early therapeutic response in vivo. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.;2004;10.1002/mrm.10731
C;Automated tumor assessment of squamous cell carcinoma on tongue cancer patients with hyperspectral imaging;Head and neck cancer (HNC) includes cancers in the oral/nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, etc., and it is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. The principal treatment is surgical removal where a complete tumor resection is crucial to reduce the recurrence and mortality rate. Intraoperative tumor imaging enables surgeons to objectively visualize the malignant lesion to maximize the tumor removal with healthy safe margins. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an emerging imaging modality for cancer detection, which can augment surgical tumor inspection, currently limited to subjective visual inspection. In this paper, we aim to investigate HSI for automated cancer detection during image-guided surgery, because it can provide quantitative information about light interaction with biological tissues and exploit the potential for malignant tissue discrimination. The proposed solution forms a novel framework for automated tongue-cancer detection, explicitly exploiting HSI, which particularly uses the spectral variations in specific bands describing the cancerous tissue properties. The method follows a machine learning based classification, employing linear support vector machine (SVM), and offers a superior sensitivity and a significant decrease in computation time. The model evaluation is on 7 ex-vivo specimens of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, with known histology. The HSI combined with the proposed classification reaches a sensitivity of 94%, specificity of 68% and area under the curve (AUC) of 92%. This feasibility study paves the way for introducing HSI as a non-invasive imaging aid for cancer detection and increase of the effectiveness of surgical oncology.;2019;10.1117/12.2512238
J;Hyperspectral wide-field-of-view imaging to study dynamic microcirculatory changes during hypoxia;Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides a fast, reliable, and noninvasive way for the study of vascular microcirculation in animal models. Rapid hyperspectral imaging of large portions of the microcirculatory preparation is critical for understanding the function and regulation of vascular microcirculatory networks. This report presents the application of an off-the-shelf benchtop HSI linear scanning system to acquire larger field-of-view images of microcirculatory preparations. The HSI line detector was displaced perpendicular to the scanning direction to map larger areas, with a rate of displacement determined by the scanning rate and the exposure time. Analysis of the collected image was used to assess dynamic changes in the microcirculation. The system records dynamic changes in microvascular hemoglobin oxygen (HbO2) saturation and vascular morphology during hypoxia and reoxygenation and has similar acquisition speeds to commonly referenced spectral-scanning HSI systems. In addition, the HbO2 saturations collected via HSI closely correlate with those collected by phosphorescence quenching microscopy. The reported system enables dynamic functional imaging of the microcirculation for broad experimental and clinical applications. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study presents a novel bench setup and algorithm to measure intravascular hemoglobin oxygen saturation in microcirculation. Wide-field hyperspectral imaging allows for rapid quantification of intravascular changes in hemoglobin saturation. The method described in this manuscript can expand the understanding of oxygen delivery to tissues in vivo.;2022;10.1152/ajpheart.00624.2021
J;Multispectral near infrared absorption imaging for histology of skin cancer;Multispectral imaging combines the spectral resolution of spectroscopy with the spatial resolution of imaging and is therefore very useful for biomedical applications. Currently, histological diagnostics use mainly stainings with standard dyes (eg, hematoxylin + eosin) to identify tumors. This method is not applicable in vivo and provides low amounts of chemical information. Biomolecules absorb near infrared light (NIR, 800-1700 nm) at different wavelengths, which could be used to fingerprint tissue. Here, we built a NIR multispectral absorption imaging setup to study skin tissue samples. NIR light (900-1500 nm) was used for homogenous wide-field transmission illumination and detected by a cooled InGaAs camera. In this setup, images I(x, y, lambda) from dermatological samples (melanoma, nodular basal-cell carcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma) were acquired to distinguish healthy from diseased tissue regions. In summary, we show the potential of multispectral NIR imaging for cancer diagnostics.;2020;10.1002/jbio.201960080
C;Feasibility of a snapshot hyperspectral imaging for detection of local skin oxygenation;Restoring normal functioning and tissue healing after surgical intervention is, among others, critically dependent on tissue oxygenation and perfusion. Tissue necrosis, caused by inadequate tissue perfusion and/or oxygenation, is a common complication after surgical reconstruction of e.g. bowel anastomoses or skin defects. Currently, several optical techniques, which do not require administration of contrast agents, have been used to evaluate tissue perfusion and oxygenation. An emerging technique is hyperspectral imaging, which is capable to detect the scattering and absorption of light delivered to the tissue, caused by inhomogeneity of biological structures, such as haemoglobin, fat or water. Recently, a snapshot hyperspectral camera was developed to measure tissue oxygenation non-invasively using relevant wavelengths in the VIS-NIR region (450-950 nm). In this study, the effect of occlusion-reperfusion of the brachial artery on cutaneous blood oxygenation is explored in three human volunteers as assessed by a snapshot hyperspectral camera system. Furthermore, measurements of local changes in skin oxygenation and blood flow after applying a local vasodilator (capsaicin-based cream) and a local vasoconstrictor (brimonidine gel) are compared to measurements of an untreated area of the skin. Hyperspectral results are correlated to the haemoglobin oxygen saturation measured by an oximeter. Simultaneously with the hyperspectral measurements, real-time blood perfusion mapping is performed using Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging, which is able to measure cutaneous skin blood flow through analysis of the speckle pattern.;2019;10.1117/12.2507840
C;Monitoring human melanocytic cell responses to piperine using multispectral imaging;Vitiligo is a depigmentary disease characterized by melanocyte loss attributed most commonly to autoimmune mechanisms. Currently vitiligo has a high incidence (1% worldwide) but a poor set of treatment options. Piperine, a compound found in black pepper, is a potential treatment for the depigmentary skin disease vitiligo, due to its ability to stimulate mouse epidermal melanocyte proliferation in vitro and in vivo. The present study investigates the use of multispectral imaging and an image processing technique based on local contrast to quantify the stimulatory effects of piperine on human melanocyte proliferation in reconstructed epidermis. We demonstrate the ability of the imaging method to quantify increased pigmentation in response to piperine treatment. The quantization of melanocyte stimulation by the proposed imaging technique illustrates the potential use of this technology to quickly assess therapeutic responses of vitiligo tissue culture models to treatment non-invasively.;2011;10.1117/12.875620
J;Indocyanine-green-loaded microballoons for biliary imaging in cholecystectomy;We encapsulate indocyanine green (ICG) in poly[(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide)-co-PEG] diblock (PLGA-PEG) microballoons for real-time fluorescence and hyperspectral imaging of biliary anatomy. ICG-loaded microballoons show superior fluorescence characteristics and slower degradation in comparison with pure ICG. The use of ICG-loaded microballoons in biliary imaging is demonstrated in both biliary-simulating phantoms and an ex vivo tissue model. The biliary-simulating phantoms are prepared by embedding ICG-loaded microballoons in agar gel and imaged by a fluorescence imaging module in a Da Vinci surgical robot. The ex vivo model consists of liver, gallbladder, common bile duct, and part of the duodenum freshly dissected from a domestic swine. After ICG-loaded microballoons are injected into the gallbladder, the biliary structure is imaged by both hyperspectral and fluorescence imaging modalities. Advanced spectral analysis and image processing algorithms are developed to classify the tissue types and identify the biliary anatomy. While fluorescence imaging provides dynamic information of movement and flow in the surgical region of interest, data from hyperspectral imaging allow for rapid identification of the bile duct and safe exclusion of any contaminant fluorescence from tissue not part of the biliary anatomy. Our experiments demonstrate the technical feasibility of using ICG-loaded microballoons for biliary imaging in cholecystectomy. (c) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

C;Multimodal multispectral imaging of the cervix in vivo for the detection of neoplasia;Optical spectroscopy has been shown to be an effective method for detecting neoplasia of epithelial tissues. Most studies to date in this realm have applied fluorescence or reflectance spectroscopy alone as a preferred method of disease detection. We have been developing instrumentation which can acquire both reflectance and fluorescence images of the human cervix in vivo, with the goal of combining multispectral. information from the two spectroscopic modalities. This instrumentation has been tested on a group of patients in a clinical setting. We have applied spectral and spatial analysis techniques to the acquired images to assess the capabilities of this technology to discriminate neoplastic from normal cervical tissue.;2001;10.1117/12.432482
C;Fast deep-tissue multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) for preclinical imaging of cancer and cardiovascular disease;Optoacoustic imaging has enabled the visualization of optical contrast at high resolutions in deep tissue. Our Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging results reveal internal tissue heterogeneity, where the underlying distribution of specific endogenous and exogenous sources of absorption can be resolved in detail. Technical advances in cardiac imaging allow motion-resolved multispectral measurements of the heart, opening the way for studies of cardiovascular disease. We further demonstrate the fast characterization of the pharmacokinetic profiles of light-absorbing agents. Overall, our MSOT findings indicate new possibilities in high resolution imaging of functional and molecular parameters.;2012;10.1117/12.906677
J;Research on Detection Technology of Brain Glioma Based on Hyperspectral Imaging;Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a new rapid and safe modern medical detection technology. In this paper, a self-developed hyperspectral imager was combined with a microscope to study the imaging spectrum of glioma tissue in human glioma mice and H & E staining pathology slides. The hyperspectral data of glioma and normal tissues were analyzed and processed to find the difference between them so as to realize the distinction of them. The experimental results show that there are some differences in the reflectivity within a specific spectral range between glioma and normal tissues, whether in pathology slides or in vivo data. We can distinguish glioma and normal tissues and provide reference and gist for clinical trials and auxiliary diagnosis in glioma surgery base on these differences.;2020;10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2020)12-3784-05
J;A review of the medical hyperspectral imaging systems and unmixing algorithms ? in biological tissues;Hyperspectral fluorescence imaging (HFI) is a well-known technique in the medical research field and is considered a non-invasive tool for tissue diagnosis. This review article gives a brief introduction to acquisition methods, including the image preprocessing methods, feature selection and extraction methods, data classifi-cation techniques and medical image analysis along with recent relevant references. The process of fusion of unsupervised unmixing techniques with other classification methods, like the combination of support vector machine with an artificial neural network, the latest snapshot Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and vortex analysis techniques are also outlined. Finally, the recent applications of hyperspectral images in cellular differentiation of various types of cancer are discussed.;2021;10.1016/j.pdpdt.2020.102165
J;Tensor decomposition of hyperspectral images to study autofluorescence in age-related macular degeneration;Autofluorescence is the emission of light by naturally occurring tissue components on the absorption of incident light. Autofluorescence within the eye is associated with several disorders, such as Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) which is a leading cause of central vision loss. Its pathogenesis is incompletely understood, but endogenous fluorophores in retinal tissue might play a role. Hyperspectral fluorescence microscopy of ex-vivo retinal tissue can be used to determine the fluorescence emission spectra of these fluorophores. Comparisons of spectra in healthy and diseased tissues can provide important insights into the pathogenesis of AMD. However, the spectrum from each pixel of the hyperspectral image is a superposition of spectra from multiple overlapping tissue components. As spectra cannot be negative, there is a need for a non-negative blind source separation model to isolate individual spectra. We propose a tensor formulation by leveraging multiple excitation wavelengths to excite the tissue sample. Arranging images from different excitation wavelengths as a tensor, a non-negative tensor decomposition can be performed to recover a provably unique low-rank model with factors representing emission and excitation spectra of these materials and corresponding abundance maps of autofluorescent substances in the tissue sample. We iteratively impute missing values common in fluorescence measurements using Expectation-Maximization and use L-2 regularization to reduce ill-posedness. Further, we present a framework for performing group hypothesis testing on hyperspectral images, finding significant differences in spectra between AMD and control groups in the peripheral macula. In the absence of ground truth, i.e. molecular identification of fluorophores, we provide a rigorous validation of chosen methods on both synthetic and real images where fluorescence spectra are known. These methodologies can be applied to the study of other pathologies presenting autofluorescence that can be captured by hyperspectral imaging. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

C;Optical Biopsy of Head and Neck Cancer Using Hyperspectral Imaging and Convolutional Neural Networks;Successful outcomes of surgical cancer resection necessitate negative, cancer-free surgical margins. Currently, tissue samples are sent to pathology for diagnostic confirmation. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an emerging, non-contact optical imaging technique. A reliable optical method could serve to diagnose and biopsy specimens in real-time. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as a tissue classifier, we developed a method to use HSI to perform an optical biopsy of ex-vivo surgical specimens, collected from 21 patients undergoing surgical cancer resection. Training and testing on samples from different patients, the CNN can distinguish squamous cell carcinoma (SCCa) from normal aerodigestive tract tissues with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.82, 81% accuracy, 81% sensitivity, and 80% specificity. Additionally, normal oral tissues can be sub-classified into epithelium, muscle, and glandular mucosa using a decision tree method, with an average AUC of 0.94, 90% accuracy, 93% sensitivity, and 89% specificity. After separately training on thyroid tissue, the CNN differentiates between thyroid carcinoma and normal thyroid with an AUC of 0.95, 92% accuracy, 92% sensitivity, and 92% specificity. Moreover, the CNN can discriminate medullary thyroid carcinoma from benign multi-nodular goiter (MNG) with an AUC of 0.93, 87% accuracy, 88% sensitivity, and 85% specificity. Classical-type papillary thyroid carcinoma is differentiated from benign MNG with an AUC of 0.91, 86% accuracy, 86% sensitivity, and 86% specificity. Our preliminary results demonstrate that an HSI-based optical biopsy method using CNNs can provide multi-category diagnostic information for normal head-and-neck tissue, SCCa, and thyroid carcinomas. More patient data are needed in order to fully investigate the proposed technique to establish reliability and generalizability of the work.;2018;10.1117/12.2289023
C;Continuous acquisition scanner for whole-body multispectral optoacoustic tomography;An essential problem dealing with three-dimensional optoacoustic imaging is the long data acquisition times associated with recording signals from multiple spatial projections, where signal averaging for each projection is applied to obtain satisfying signal-to-noise-ratio. This approach complicates acquisition and makes imaging challenging for most applications, especially for in vivo imaging and multispectral imaging. Instead we employ a herein introduced continuous data acquisition methodology that greatly shortens recording times over multiple projection angles and acquires high quality tomographic data without averaging. By this means a two dimensional image acquisition having 270 angular projections only takes about 9 seconds, while a full multispectral three dimensional image can normally take about 15 minutes to acquire with a single ultrasonic detector. The system performance is verified on tissue-mimicking phantoms containing known concentrations of fluorescent molecular agent as well as small animals.;2010;10.1117/12.842776
J;Supervised Machine Learning Methods and Hyperspectral Imaging Techniques Jointly Applied for Brain Cancer Classification;Hyperspectral imaging techniques (HSI) do not require contact with patients and are non-ionizing as well as non-invasive. As a consequence, they have been extensively applied in the medical field. HSI is being combined with machine learning (ML) processes to obtain models to assist in diagnosis. In particular, the combination of these techniques has proven to be a reliable aid in the differentiation of healthy and tumor tissue during brain tumor surgery. ML algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used to make predictions and provide in-vivo visualizations that may assist neurosurgeons in being more precise, hence reducing damages to healthy tissue. In this work, thirteen in-vivo hyperspectral images from twelve different patients with high-grade gliomas (grade III and IV) have been selected to train SVM, RF and CNN classifiers. Five different classes have been defined during the experiments: healthy tissue, tumor, venous blood vessel, arterial blood vessel and dura mater. Overall accuracy (OACC) results vary from 60% to 95% depending on the training conditions. Finally, as far as the contribution of each band to the OACC is concerned, the results obtained in this work are 3.81 times greater than those reported in the literature.;2021;10.3390/s21113827
J;MULTISPECTRAL UNMIXING OF FLUORESCENCE MOLECULAR TOMOGRAPHY DATA;Even though multispectral imaging is considered very significant in biological imaging, it is only commonly used in microscopy in a 2D approach. Here, we present a Fluorescence Molecular Tomography system capable of recording simultaneously tomographic data at several spectral windows, enabling multispectral tomography. 3D reconstructed data from several spectral windows is used to construct a linear unmixing algorithm for multispectral deconvolution of overlapping fluorescence signals. The method is applied on tomographic 3D fluorescence concentration maps in tissue-mimicking phantoms, yielding absolute quantification of the concentration of each individual fluorophore. Results are compared to the case when unmixing is performed in the raw 2D data instead of the reconstructed 3D concentration map, showing greater accuracy when unmixing algorithms are applied in the reconstructed data. Both the reflection and transmission geometries are considered.;2009;10.1142/S1793545809000656
J;Autofluorescence removal, multiplexing, and automated analysis methods for in-vivo fluorescence imaging;The ability to image and quantitate fluorescently labeled markers in vivo has generally been limited by autofluorescence of the tissue. Skin, in particular, has a strong autofluorescence signal, particularly when excited in the blue or green wavelengths. Fluorescence labels with emission wavelengths in the near-infrared are more amenable to deep-tissue imaging, because both scattering and autofluorescence are reduced as wavelengths are increased, but even in these spectral regions, autofluorescence can still limit sensitivity. Multispectral imaging (MSI), however, can remove the signal degradation caused by autofluorescence while adding enhanced multiplexing capabilities. While the availability of spectral libraries makes multispectral analysis routine for well-characterized samples, new software tools have been developed that greatly simplify the application of MSI to novel specimens.

J;Second derivative multispectral algorithm for quantitative assessment of cutaneous tissue oxygenation;We report a second derivative multispectral algorithm for quantitative assessment of cutaneous tissue oxygen saturation (StO(2)). The algorithm is based on a forward model of light transport in multilayered skin tissue and an inverse algorithm for StO(2) reconstruction. Based on the forward simulation results, a parameter of a second derivative ratio (SDR) is derived as a function of cutaneous tissue StO(2). The SDR function is optimized at a wavelength set of 544, 552, 568, 576, 592, and 600 nm so that cutaneous tissue StO(2) can be derived with minimal artifacts by blood concentration, tissue scattering, and melanin concentration. The proposed multispectral StO(2) imaging algorithm is verified in both benchtop and in vivo experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed multispectral imaging algorithm is able to map cutaneous tissue StO(2) in high temporal resolution with reduced measurement artifacts induced by different skin conditions in comparison with other three commercial tissue oxygen measurement systems. These results indicate that the multispectral StO(2) imaging technique has the potential for noninvasive and quantitative assessment of skin tissue oxygenation with a high temporal resolution.

J;Hyperspectral imaging for label-free in vivo identification of myocardial scars and sites of radiofrequency ablation lesions;BACKGROUND Treatment of cardiac arrhythmias often involves ablating viable muscle tissue within or near islands of scarred myocardium. Yet, today there are limited means by which the boundaries of such scars can be visualized during surgery and distinguished from the sites of acute injury caused by radiofrequency (RF) ablation. OBJECTIVE We sought to explore a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) methodology to delineate and distinguish scar tissue from tissue injury caused by RF ablation. METHODS RF ablation of the ventricular surface of live rats that underwent thoracotomy was followed by a 2-month animal recovery period. During a second surgery, new RF lesions were placed next to the scarred tissue from the previous ablation procedure. The myocardial infarction model was used as an alternative way to create scar tissue. RESULTS Excitation-emission matrices acquired from the sites of RF lesions, scar region, and the surrounding unablated tissue re-vealed multiple spectral changes. These findings justified HSI of the heart surface using illumination with 365 nm UV light while acquiring spectral images within the visible range. Autofluorescence-based HSI enabled to distinguish sites of RF lesions from scar or unablated myocardium in open-chest rats. A pilot version of a percutaneous HSI catheter was used to demonstrate the feasibility of RF lesion visualization in atrial tissue of live pigs. CONCLUSION HSI based on changes in tissue autofluorescence is a highly effective tool for revealing-in vivo and with high spatial resolution-surface boundaries of myocardial scar and discriminating it from areas of acute necrosis caused by RF ablation.;2018;10.1016/j.hrthm.2017.12.014
J;Oxygenation and perfusion monitoring with a hyperspectral camera system for chemical based tissue analysis of skin and organs;The monitoring of free flaps, free transplants or organs for transplantation still poses a problem in medicine. Available systems for the measurement of perfusion and oxygenation can only perform localized measurements and usually need contact with the tissue. Contact free hyperspectral imaging and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for the analysis of tissue oxygenation and perfusion have been used in many scientific studies with good results. But up to now the clinical and scientific application of this technology has been hindered by the lack of hyperspectral measurement systems usable in clinical practice. We will introduce the application of a new hyperspectral camera system for the quick and robust recording of remission spectra in the combined VIS and NIR spectral range with high spectral and spatial resolution. This new system can be applied for the clinical monitoring of free flaps and organs providing high quality oxygenation and perfusion images.;2016;10.1088/0967-3334/37/11/2064
J;Hyperspectral wide gap second derivative analysis for in vivo detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia;Hyperspectral reflectance imaging technique has been used for in vivo detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. However, the clinical outcome of this technique is suboptimal owing to multiple limitations such as nonuniform illumination, high-cost and bulky setup, and time-consuming data acquisition and processing. To overcome these limitations, we acquired the hyperspectral data cube in a wavelength ranging from 600 to 800 nm and processed it by a wide gap second derivative analysis method. This method effectively reduced the image artifacts caused by nonuniform illumination and background absorption. Furthermore, with second derivative analysis, only three specific wavelengths (620, 696, and 772 nm) are needed for tissue classification with optimal separability. Clinical feasibility of the proposed image analysis and classification method was tested in a clinical trial where cervical hyperspectral images from three patients were used for classification analysis. Our proposed method successfully classified the cervix tissue into three categories of normal, inflammation and high-grade lesion. These classification results were coincident with those by an experienced gynecology oncologist after applying acetic acid. Our preliminary clinical study has demonstrated the technical feasibility for in vivo and noninvasive detection of cervical neoplasia without acetic acid. Further clinical research is needed in order to establish a large-scale diagnostic database and optimize the tissue classification technique.

C;Three-dimensional multispectral hand-held optoacoustic imaging with microsecond-level delayed laser pulses;Three-dimensional hand-held optoacoustic imaging comes with important advantages that prompt the clinical translation of this modality, with applications envisioned in cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease, disorders of the lymphatic system, breast cancer, arthritis or inflammation. Of particular importance is the multispectral acquisition of data by exciting the tissue at several wavelengths, which enables functional imaging applications. However, multispectral imaging of entire three-dimensional regions is significantly challenged by motion artefacts in concurrent acquisitions at different wavelengths. A method based on acquisition of volumetric datasets having a microsecond-level delay between pulses at different wavelengths is described in this work. This method can avoid image artefacts imposed by a scanning velocity greater than 2 m/s, thus, does not only facilitate imaging influenced by respiratory, cardiac or other intrinsic fast movements in living tissues, but can achieve artifact-free imaging in the presence of more significant motion, e. g. abrupt displacements during handheld-mode operation in a clinical environment.;2015;10.1117/12.2080300
C;Multiview hyperspectral topography of tissue structural and functional characteristics;Accurate and in vivo characterization of structural, functional, and molecular characteristics of biological tissue will facilitate quantitative diagnosis, therapeutic guidance, and outcome assessment in many clinical applications, such as wound healing, cancer surgery, and organ transplantation. However, many clinical imaging systems have limitations and fail to provide noninvasive, real time, and quantitative assessment of biological tissue in an operation room. To overcome these limitations, we developed and tested a multiview hyperspectral imaging system. The multiview hyperspectral imaging system integrated the multiview and the hyperspectral imaging techniques in a single portable unit. Four plane mirrors are cohered together as a multiview reflective mirror set with a rectangular cross section. The multiview reflective mirror set was placed between a hyperspectral camera and the measured biological tissue. For a single image acquisition task, a hyperspectral data cube with five views was obtained. The five-view hyperspectral image consisted of a main objective image and four reflective images. Three-dimensional topography of the scene was achieved by correlating the matching pixels between the objective image and the reflective images. Three-dimensional mapping of tissue oxygenation was achieved using a hyperspectral oxygenation algorithm. The multiview hyperspectral imaging technique is currently under quantitative validation in a wound model, a tissue-simulating blood phantom, and an in vivo biological tissue model. The preliminary results have demonstrated the technical feasibility of using multiview hyperspectral imaging for three-dimensional topography of tissue functional properties.;2012;10.1117/12.1000006
C;Validation of a fiber-based confocal microscope for interventional image-guided procedures: Correlation with multispectral optical imaging.;The concept of the biopsy is ubiquitous in current medical diagnosis of cancer and other diseases. The standard biopsy consists of removing a sample of tissue for evaluation and diagnosis, primarily to ascertain the presence of cancer cells by (histo)pathological analyses. However, the advent of new optical imaging modalities and targeted or smart agents, that have affinity for a select target, suggests the possibility of performing in vivo tissue characterization without the need for sample removal or the wait for histopathologic processing. Here we present work testing and validating a fiber-based confocal fluorescence microscopic imaging system intended for combination with a larger scale imaging modality (i.e. MRI or CT) to be used in image-guided in vivo tissue characterization. Fiber-based confocal fluorescence microscopic imaging experiments were performed (Cellvizio, Mauna Kea Technologies, Paris, France) in vivo in two mouse models including: 1) EGFP-expressing mouse melanoma model and 2) M21 mouse melanoma model. Both models are known to express integrin alpha(v)beta(3), a cell-surface receptor protein. We also performed an experiment in ex vivo chicken muscle tissue labelled with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-lectin targeted compound. In the mouse models, contrast agents that targeted the integrin were injected and the contrast agent localization in tumor was verified by a whole-body multispectral imager. The fiber-based tool was sensitive enough to detect and image the tissue of interest in all different experiments, and was found appropriate for use in interventional catheter-based procedures.;2006;10.1117/12.653272
J;Automated Spectroscopic Tissue Classification in Colorectal Surgery;Background. In colorectal surgery, detecting ureters and mesenteric arteries is of utmost importance to prevent iatrogenic injury and to facilitate intraoperative decision making. A tool enabling ureter- and artery-specific image enhancement within (and possibly through) surrounding adipose tissue would facilitate this need, especially during laparoscopy. To evaluate the potential of hyperspectral imaging in colorectal surgery, we explored spectral tissue signatures using single-spot diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). As hyperspectral cameras with silicon (Si) and indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) sensor chips are becoming available, we investigated spectral distinctive features for both sensor ranges. Methods. In vivo wide-band (wavelength range 350-1830 nm) DRS was performed during open colorectal surgery. From the recorded spectra, 36 features were extracted at predefined wavelengths: 18 gradients and 18 amplitude differences. For classification of respectively ureter and artery in relation to surrounding adipose tissue, the best distinctive feature was selected using binary logistic regression for Si- and InGaAs-sensor spectral ranges separately. Classification performance was evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation. Results. In 10 consecutive patients, 253 spectra were recorded on 53 tissue sites (including colon, adipose tissue, muscle, artery, vein, ureter). Classification of ureter versus adipose tissue revealed accuracy of 100% for both Si range and InGaAs range. Classification of artery versus surrounding adipose tissue revealed accuracies of 95% (Si) and 89% (InGaAs). Conclusions. Intraoperative DRS showed that Si and InGaAs sensors are equally suited for automated classification of ureter versus surrounding adipose tissue. Si sensors seem better suited for classifying artery versus mesenteric adipose tissue. Progress toward hyperspectral imaging within this field is promising.;2015;10.1177/1553350615569076
J;Multispectral Opto-acoustic Tomography (MSOT) of the Brain and Glioblastoma Characterization;Brain research depends strongly on imaging for assessing function and disease in vivo. We examine herein multispectral opto-acoustic tomography (MSOT), a novel technology for high-resolution molecular imaging deep inside tissues. MSOT illuminates tissue with light pulses at multiple wavelengths and detects the acoustic waves generated by the thermoelastic expansion of the environment surrounding absorbing molecules. Using spectral unmixing analysis of the data collected, MSOT can then differentiate the spectral signatures of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin and of photo-absorbing agents and quantify their concentration. By being able to detect absorbing molecules up to centimeters deep in the tissue it represents an ideal modality for small animal brain imaging, simultaneously providing anatomical, hemodynamic, functional, and molecular information. In this work we examine the capacity of MSOT in cross-sectional brain imaging of mice. We find unprecedented optical imaging performance in cross-sectional visualization of anatomical and physiological parameters of the mouse brain. For example, the potential of MSOT to characterize ischemic brain areas was demonstrated through the use of a carbon dioxide challenge. In addition, indocyanine green (ICG) was injected intravenously, and the kinetics of uptake and clearance in the vasculature of the brain was visualized in real-time. We further found that multiparameter, multispectral imaging of the growth of U87 tumor cells injected into the brain could be visualized through the intact mouse head, for example through visualization of deoxygenated hemoglobin in the growing tumor. We also demonstrate how MSOT offers several compelling features for brain research and allows time-dependent detection and quantification of brain parameters that are not available using other imaging methods without invasive procedures.

J;Low-cost compact multispectral spatial frequency domain imaging prototype for tissue characterization;We present a low cost, compact, and multispectral spatial frequency domain imaging prototype.

J;Preliminary Study of Vulvar Lichen Sclerosis Diagnosis Based on Hyperspectral Imaging;To compare the hyperspectral differences of the vulvar lichen sclerosis (VLS) tissue and normal vulvar tissue and extract their respective features, the melanin content and tissue oxygen saturation (StO(2)) in the vulvar skin tissue of 40 patients with VLS were quantitatively analyzed via hyperspectral imaging. Our experimental results suggest that the melanin content index and StO(2) index in lesions are statistically lower than those in the normal vulvar tissues. Therefore, by quantifying the difference between melanin content index and StO(2) index in normal vulvar tissue and VLS tissue, hyperspectral imaging technology provides the possibility of in vivo assisted diagnosis of VLS.;2022;10.3788/LOP202259.0617027
J;Identification of pancreatic tumors in vivo with ligand-targeted, pH responsive mesoporous silica nanoparticles by multispectral optoacoustic tomography;"Despite significant efforts to translate nanotechnology for cancer application, lack of identification of biodistribution/accumulation of these nanovehicles in vivo remains a substantial barrier for successful implementation of theranostic nanoparticles in the clinic. The purpose of the study was to develop a tumor-targeted theranostic nanovehicle for pancreatic cancer detectable by multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT). To improve the tumor specificity of our mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN), we utilized a dual targeting strategy: 1) an elevated tumor receptor, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (UPAR), and 2) the acidic tumor microenvironment. The tumor specificity of the MSN particle was improved with the addition of both chitosan, targeting acidic pH, and urokinase plasminogen activator (UPA), targeting UPAR. Drug release assays confirmed pH responsive release of gemcitabine in vitro. The UPAR specific binding of MSN-UPA nanoparticles was confirmed by reduction in fluorescence signal following MSN-UPA nanoparticle treatment in UPAR positive cells blocked with a UPAR-blocking antibody. Based upon Indocyanine Green encapsulation within the nanoparticles, UPA ligand targeted MSNs demonstrated increased intensity compared to untargeted MSNs at both pH 7.4 (7x) and 6.5 (20x); however the signal was much more pronounced at a pH of 6.5 using tissue phantoms (p < 0.05). In vivo, MSN-UPA particles demonstrated orthotopic pancreatic tumor specific accumulation compared to liver or kidney as identified using multispectral optoacoustic tomography (p < 0.05) and confirmed by ex vivo analysis. By tracking in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution with MSOT, it was shown that pH responsive, ligand targeted MSNs preferentially bind to pancreatic tumors for payload delivery. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J;Penetration depth of photons in biological tissues from hyperspectral imaging in shortwave infrared in transmission and reflection geometries;"Measurement of photon penetration in biological tissues is a central theme in optical imaging. A great number of endogenous tissue factors such as absorption, scattering, and anisotropy affect the path of photons in tissue, making it difficult to predict the penetration depth at different wavelengths. Traditional studies evaluating photon penetration at different wavelengths are focused on tissue spectroscopy that does not take into account the heterogeneity within the sample. This is especially critical in shortwave infrared where the individual vibration-based absorption properties of the tissue molecules are affected by nearby tissue components. We have explored the depth penetration in biological tissues from 900 to 1650 nm using Monte-Carlo simulation and a hyperspectral imaging system with Michelson spatial contrast as a metric of light penetration. Chromatic aberration-free hyperspectral images in transmission and reflection geometries were collected with a spectral resolution of 5.27 nm and a total acquisition time of 3 min. Relatively short recording time minimized artifacts from sample drying. Results from both transmission and reflection geometries consistently revealed that the highest spatial contrast in the wavelength range for deep tissue lies within 1300 to 1375 nm; however, in heavily pigmented tissue such as the liver, the range 1550 to 1600 nm is also prominent.

J;Multispectral photoacoustic imaging of tumours in mice injected with an enzyme-activatable photoacoustic probe;Photoacoustic (PA) imaging offers depth-resolved images of optical absorbers with the spatial resolution of ultrasound imaging. To enhance tumour contrast, tumour-specific probes are used as contrast agents. We synthesised a colourless PA probe that is activated in the presence of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase, a cancer-associated enzyme, to show its original colour and fluorescence. We have acquired high specificity fluorescence images of small tumours, using a fluorescent probe based on similar enzymatic reactions. Here, we developed a PA imaging technique to detect the PA probe. In PA imaging, depending on the concentration and excitation wavelength of the probe, the intensities of the probe signals may be lower than those of the background signals produced by intrinsic optical absorbers such as haemoglobin. For probe imaging in the presence of strong background signals, multispectral photoacoustic (MS-PA) imaging was evaluated. In MS-PA imaging, the spectral fitting method, which distinguishes the probe signals from background signals using reference spectra, has been widely used. To compensate for the decrease of fluence due to optical attenuation in biological tissue, we used a simplified compensation method that calculates fluence inside biological tissues by the Monte-Carlo model using published data on optical properties of biological tissues. The validity of the method was confirmed using tissue-mimicking phantoms. Finally, MS-PA imaging of a mouse subcutaneous tumour injected with the activatable probe was demonstrated. In conclusion, our MS-PA imaging technique afforded successful detection of the activated probe in the tumour, and time-increase of PA signals were successfully observed.;2017;10.1088/2040-8978/19/1/014002
C;Robust registration of sparsely sectioned histology to ex-vivo MRI of temporal lobe resections;Surgical resection of epileptic foci is a typical treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy, however, accurate pre-operative localization is challenging and often requires invasive sub-dural or intra-cranial electrode placement. The presence of cellular abnormalities in the resected tissue can be used to validate the effectiveness of multispectral Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in pre-operative foci localization and surgical planning. If successful, these techniques can lead to improved surgical outcomes and less invasive procedures. Towards this goal, a novel pipeline is presented here for post-operative imaging of temporal lobe specimens involving MRI and digital histology, and present and evaluate methods for bringing these images into spatial correspondence. The sparsely-sectioned histology images of resected tissue represents a challenge for 3D reconstruction which we address with a combined 3D and 2D rigid registration algorithm that alternates between slice-based and volume-based registration with the ex-vivo MRI. We also evaluate four methods for non-rigid within-plane registration using both images and fiducials, with the top performing method resulting in a target registration error of 0.87 mm. This work allows for the spatially-local comparison of histology with post-operative MRI and paves the way for eventual registration with pre-operative MRI images.;2012;10.1117/12.911058
J;FRaeppli: a multispectral imaging toolbox for cell tracing and dense tissue analysis in zebrafish;Visualizing cell shapes and interactions of differentiating cells is instrumental for understanding organ development and repair. Across species, strategies for stochastic multicolour labelling have greatly facilitated in vivo cell tracking and mapping neuronal connectivity. Yet integrating multi-fluorophore information into the context of developing zebrafish tissues is challenging given their cytoplasmic localization and spectral incompatibility with common fluorescent markers. Inspired by Drosophila Raeppli, we developed FRaeppli (Fish-Raeppli) by expressing bright membrane- or nuclear-targeted fluorescent proteins for efficient cell shape analysis and tracking. High spatiotemporal activation flexibility is provided by the Gal4/UAS system together with Cre/lox and/or PhiC31 integrase. The distinct spectra of the FRaeppli fluorescent proteins allow simultaneous imaging with GFP and infrared subcellular reporters or tissue landmarks. We demonstrate the suitability of FRaeppli for live imaging of complex internal organs, such as the liver, and have tailored hyperspectral protocols for time-efficient acquisition. Combining FRaeppli with polarity markers revealed previously unknown canalicular topologies between differentiating hepatocytes, reminiscent of the mammalian liver, suggesting common developmental mechanisms. The multispectral FRaeppli toolbox thus enables the comprehensive analysis of intricate cellular morphologies, topologies and lineages at single-cell resolution in zebrafish.;2022;10.1242/dev.199615
C;Innovative and high-performance instrumentation for biomedical Mueller polarimetric imaging in vivo;Mueller Polarimetric Imaging (MPI) showed promising results in biomedical applications, especially for early detection of precancerous lesions on biological tissues. This technique is label-free, non-invasive and can be implemented with a large field of view (up to several cm(2)) to image wide areas of biological tissues while providing information on its microstructure. The development of innovative (MPI) systems, able to analyze biological tissues in vivo on human patients, remains an instrumental challenge. Our goal is to build miniaturized and compact full-field MPI systems based on Ferroelectric Liquid Crystals (FLCs) capable of performing a multispectral accurate analysis of biological tissues in vivo. In this work, an innovative approach is showed to realize optimized and fast FLCs-based MPI systems able to perform full-field imaging acquisitions in the spectral range between 450 and 700nm with error less than 1% on all the elements of measured Mueller matrices. This system can be accurately calibrated by using the Eigenvalue Calibration Method (ECM) also in presence of high residual instrumental depolarization. This approach enables us to realize compact and reliable MPI systems which can be easily integrated into existing instruments currently used in medical practice.;2019;10.1117/12.2510232
J;Direct curvature correction for noncontact imaging modalities applied to multispectral imaging;Noncontact optical imaging of curved objects can result in strong artifacts due to the object's shape, leading to curvature biased intensity distributions. This artifact can mask variations due to the object's optical properties, and makes reconstruction of optical/physiological properties difficult. In this work we demonstrate a curvature correction method that removes this artifact and recovers the underlying data, without the necessity of measuring the object's shape. This method is applicable to many optical imaging modalities that suffer from shape-based intensity biases. By separating the spatially varying data (e.g., physiological changes) from the background signal (dc component), we show that the curvature can be extracted by either averaging or fitting the rows and columns of the images. Numerical simulations show that our method is equivalent to directly removing the curvature, when the object's shape is known, and accurately recovers the underlying data. Experiments on phantoms validate the numerical results and show that for a given image with 16.5% error due to curvature, the method reduces that error to 1.2%. Finally, diffuse multispectral images are acquired on forearms in vivo. We demonstrate the enhancement in image quality on intensity images, and consequently on reconstruction results of blood volume and oxygenation distributions.

J;A Fully Constrained Optimization Method for Time-Resolved Multispectral Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy Data Unmixing;This paper presents a new unmixing methodology of multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (m-FLIM) data, in which the spectrum is defined as the combination of time-domain fluorescence decays at multiple emission wavelengths. The method is based on a quadratic constrained optimization (CO) algorithm that provides a closed-form solution under equality and inequality restrictions. In this paper, it is assumed that the time-resolved fluorescence spectrum profiles of the constituent components are linearly independent and known a priori. For comparison purposes, the standard least squares (LS) solution and two constrained versions nonnegativity constrained least squares (NCLS) and fully constrained least squares (FCLS) (Heinz and Chang, 2001) are also tested. Their performance was evaluated by using synthetic simulations, as well as imaged samples from fluorescent dyes and ex vivo tissue. In all the synthetic evaluations, the CO obtained the best accuracy in the estimations of the proportional contributions. CO could achieve an improvement ranging between 41 % and 59% in the relative error compared to LS, NCLS, and FCLS at different signal-to-noise ratios. A liquid mixture of fluorescent dyes was also prepared and imaged in order to provide a controlled scenario with real data, where CO and FCLS obtained the best performance. The CO and FCLS were also tested with 20 ex vivo samples of human coronary arteries, where the expected concentrations are qualitatively known. A certainty measure was employed to assess the confidence in the estimations made by each algorithm. The experiments confirmed a better performance of CO, since this method is optimal with respect to equality and inequality restrictions in the linear unmixing formulation. Thus, the evaluation showed that CO achieves an accurate characterization of the samples. Furthermore, CO is a computational efficient alternative to estimate the abundance of components in m-FLIM data, since a global optimal solution is always guaranteed in a closed form.;2013;10.1109/TBME.2013.2241431
J;Multispectral optoacoustic and MRI coregistration for molecular imaging of orthotopic model of human glioblastoma;Multi-modality imaging methods are of great importance in oncologic studies for acquiring complementary information, enhancing the efficacy in tumor detection and characterization. We hereby demonstrate a hybrid non-invasive in vivo imaging approach of utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) for molecular imaging of glucose uptake in an orthotopic glioblastoma in mouse. The molecular and functional information from MSOT can be overlaid on MRI anatomy via image coregistration to provide insights into probe uptake in the brain, which is verified by ex vivo fluorescence imaging and histological validation. In vivo MSOT and MRI imaging of an orthotopic glioma mouse model injected with IRDye800-2DG. Image co-registration between MSOT and MRI enables multifaceted (anatomical, functional, molecular) information from MSOT to be overlaid on MRI anatomy images to derive tumor physiological parameters such as perfusion, haemoglobin and oxygenation.;2016;10.1002/jbio.201500321
C;Imaging the spectral reflectance properties of bipolar radiofrequency-fused bowel tissue;"Delivery of radiofrequency (RF) electrical energy is used during surgery to heat and seal tissue, such as vessels, allowing resection without blood loss. Recent work has suggested that this approach may be extended to allow surgical attachment of larger tissue segments for applications such as bowel anastomosis. In a large series of porcine surgical procedures bipolar RF energy was used to resect and re-seal the small bowel in vivo with a commercial tissue fusion device (Ligasure; Covidien PLC, USA). The tissue was then imaged with a multispectral imaging laparoscope to obtain a spectral datacube comprising both fused and healthy tissue. Maps of blood volume, oxygen saturation and scattering power were derived from the measured reflectance spectra using an optimised light-tissue interaction model. A 60% increase in reflectance of visible light (460-700 nm) was observed after fusion, with the tissue taking on a white appearance. Despite this the distinctive shape of the haemoglobin absorption spectrum was still noticeable in the 460600 nm wavelength range. Scattering power increased in the fused region in comparison to normal serosa, while blood volume and oxygen saturation decreased. Observed fusion-induced changes in the reflectance spectrum are consistent with the biophysical changes induced through tissue denaturation and increased collagen cross-linking. The multispectral imager allows mapping of the spatial extent of these changes and classification of the zone of damaged tissue. Further analysis of the spectral data in parallel with histopathological examination of excised specimens will allow correlation of the optical property changes with microscopic alterations in tissue structure.";2015;10.1117/12.2184470
C;Comparing Methods for Analysis of Biomedical Hyperspectral Image Data;Over the past 2 decades, hyperspectral imaging technologies have been adapted to address the need for molecule-specific identification in the biomedical imaging field. Applications have ranged from single-cell microscopy to whole-animal in vivo imaging and from basic research to clinical systems. Enabling this growth has been the availability of faster, more effective hyperspectral filtering technologies and more sensitive detectors. Hence, the potential for growth of biomedical hyperspectral imaging is high, and many hyperspectral imaging options are already commercially available. However, despite the growth in hyperspectral technologies for biomedical imaging, little work has been done to aid users of hyperspectral imaging instruments in selecting appropriate analysis algorithms. Here, we present an approach for comparing the effectiveness of spectral analysis algorithms by combining experimental image data with a theoretical what if scenario. This approach allows us to quantify several key outcomes that characterize a hyperspectral imaging study: linearity of sensitivity, positive detection cut-off slope, dynamic range, and false positive events. We present results of using this approach for comparing the effectiveness of several common spectral analysis algorithms for detecting weak fluorescent protein emission in the midst of strong tissue autofluorescence. Results indicate that this approach should be applicable to a very wide range of applications, allowing a quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of the combined biology, hardware, and computational analysis for detecting a specific molecular signature.;2017;10.1117/12.2252827
C;Optimization and applications of an excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging system;Currently, the majority of microscopic and endoscopic technologies utilize white light illumination. For a number of applications, hyper-spectral imaging can be shown to have significant improvements over standard white-light imaging techniques. This is true for both microscopy and in vivo imaging. However, hyperspectral imaging methods have suffered from slow application times. Often, minutes are required to gather a full imaging stack. Here we will describe the system and evaluate optimizations and applications of a novel excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging system. We have developed and are optimizing a novel approach called excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging that provides an order of magnitude increased signal strength. Optimization of the light path, optical components and illumination sources have allowed us to achieve high speed image acquisition. This high speed allows for potential live video acquisition. This excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging technology has potential to impact a range of applications. The current system allows triggering of up to 16 wavelengths at less than 1 millisecond per image using digital strobing. Analog intensity control is also provided for a fully customizable excitation profile. A significant advantage of excitationscanning hyperspectral imaging is can identify multiple targets simultaneously in real time. We are optimizing the system to compare sensitivity and specificity of excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging with pathology techniques. Finally, we are exploring utilizing this technology to measure cAMP distribution in three dimensions within a cell.;2017;10.1117/12.2252409
J;Three-dimensional reconstruction of in vivo bioluminescent sources based on multispectral imaging;A new method is described for obtaining a 3-D reconstruction of a bioluminescent light source distribution inside a living animal subject, from multispectral images of the surface light emission acquired on charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. The method uses the 3-D surface topography of the animal, which is obtained from a structured light illumination technique. The forward model of photon transport is based on the diffusion approximation in homogeneous tissue with a local planar boundary approximation for each mesh element, allowing rapid calculation of the forward Green's function kernel. Absorption and scattering properties of tissue are measured a priori as input to the algorithm. By using multispectral images, 3-D reconstructions of luminescent sources can be derived from images acquired from only a single view. As a demonstration, the reconstruction technique is applied to determine the location and brightness of a source embedded in a homogeneous phantom subject in the shape of a mouse. The technique is then evaluated with real mouse models in which calibrated sources are implanted at known locations within living tissue. Finally, reconstructions are demonstrated in a PC3M-luc (prostate tumor line) metastatic tumor model in nude mice. (C) 2007 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.;2007;10.1117/1.2717898
J;Fluorescence hyperspectral imaging (fHSI) using a spectrally resolved detector array;The ability to resolve multiple fluorescent emissions from different biological targets in video rate applications, such as endoscopy and intraoperative imaging, has traditionally been limited by the use of filter-based imaging systems. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) facilitates the detection of both spatial and spectral information in a single data acquisition, however, instrumentation for HSI is typically complex, bulky and expensive. We sought to overcome these limitations using a novel robust and low cost HSI camera based on a spectrally resolved detector array (SRDA). We integrated this HSI camera into a wide-field reflectance-based imaging system operating in the near-infrared range to assess the suitability for invivo imaging of exogenous fluorescent contrast agents. Using this fluorescence HSI (fHSI) system, we were able to accurately resolve the presence and concentration of at least 7 fluorescent dyes in solution. We also demonstrate high spectral unmixing precision, signal linearity with dye concentration and at depth in tissue mimicking phantoms, and delineate 4 fluorescent dyes invivo. Our approach, including statistical background removal, could be directly generalised to broader spectral ranges, for example, to resolve tissue reflectance or autofluorescence and in future be tailored to video rate applications requiring snapshot HSI data acquisition.;2017;10.1002/jbio.201600304
J;Hyperspectral imaging system based on a single-pixel camera design for detecting differences in tissue properties;Optical spectroscopy can be used to distinguish between healthy and diseased tissue. In this study, the design and testing of a single-pixel hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system that uses autofluorescence emission from collagen (400 nm) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (475 nm) along with differences in the optical reflectance spectra to differentiate between healthy and thermally damaged tissue is discussed. The changes in protein autofluorescence and reflectance due to thermal damage are studied in ex vivo porcine tissue models. Thermal lesions were created in porcine skin (n = 12) and liver (n = 15) samples using an IR laser. The damaged regions were clearly visible in the hyperspectral images. Sizes of the thermally damaged regions as measured via HSI are compared to sizes of these regions as measured in white-light images and via physical measurement. Good agreement between the sizes measured in the hyperspectral images, white-light imaging, and physical measurements were found. The HSI system can differentiate between healthy and damaged tissue. Possible applications of this imaging system include determination of tumor margins during surgery/biopsy and cancer diagnosis and staging.

J;High Precision Monitoring of Radiofrequency Ablation for Liver Using Hyperspectral Imaging;Minimally invasive procedures are achieving better satisfaction for treating liver cancers. Energy-based techniques were studied as prospective alternatives to the gold standard of liver transplantation. Among these techniques, radiofrequency (RF) was investigated for the selective ablation of liver tissue. In addition to optimizing the RF settings for the purpose of overcoming tissue perforation or inadequate ablation, an instrument collecting quantitative data regarding the intraoperative tissue status can aid the treatment procedure. This study demonstrates an innovative noninvasive technique using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for monitoring RF ablative therapy in ex-vivo liver tissue. The cubic data generated by HSI provides spectral as well as spatial properties of the liver tissue included in each pixel of the field of view. In our study, the applied statistical analysis saves the computational burdens of multivariate analysis techniques. For this purpose, spectral angle mapper, logistic regression algorithm, and principal component analysis were applied. Of all spectral bands captured by the HSI camera, bands centered at 760 and 960 nm were identified for predicting the ablated area. Based on statistical analysis, the threshold for predicting the ablated area of the liver samples was determined, provided that the specificity is kept at 90%.;2021;10.1007/s10439-021-02797-w
C;Hyperspectral image-based analysis of thermal damage in living liver undergoing laser ablation;Laser ablation (LA) is a minimally invasive procedure based on light/tissue interaction aimed to induce a controlled tumor necrosis by increasing tissue temperature. Given the relationship between tissue damage and produced heat, LA needs a fine control of evolving thermal effects in order to evaluate and control procedure outcome. This study relies on biomedical optics principles for non-invasive diagnostic tools development, and presents a contactless approach based on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to monitor thermal damage during in vivo porcine LA. By collecting relative pixel-by-pixel reflectance/absorbance of a wide range spectmm (500-1000nm), HSI can track molecular structure modifications caused by the thermoablative procedure. Indeed, these modifications alter tissue light scattering and absorption. In order to investigate tissue spectmm change by increasing temperature, HSI was collected at fixed maximum temperatures (37, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110 degrees C) and immediately after LA (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 minutes). Tissue spectral response for two tests was analyzed also relying on the ablated area considered. Regions of Interest of different dimensions (16, 77, and 170 pixels) were placed in the images after applying a motion correction. Obtained spectra show noticeable variations once a specific temperature threshold has been reached (80-100 degrees C). Specifically, the measured absorbance variation for selected wavelengths (630, 760, 960nm, for methemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, and water respectively) confirms tissue optical behavior dependence with its thermal state. This preliminary investigation discloses the potential of HSI measurement to characterize LA damage, encouraging future studies to standardize this novel technique.;2020;10.1117/12.2555465
C;Quantifying optical properties in small animals using MR-guided multispectral time-resolved imaging;We propose the use of Time-Resolved Diffuse Optical Tomography in a multispectral scheme with anatomical constraints supplied by MR imaging to reconstruct functional parameters of the animal model with greater accuracy and resolution. The tomographic imaging system described is capable of acquiring temporal measurements in multiple-views using a gated ICCD camera. A tunable Ti-Sapphire pulsed laser at wavelengths between 700nm - 1000nm is used as the source. Anatomical distribution is determined using MRI in a non-concurrent setting. Time-resolved measurements at multiple wavelengths in the NIR window combined with the anatomical constraints is used to determine a 3D distribution of the functional parameters in vivo. Multispectral spectroscopy measurements on homogenous tissue simulating phantoms are used to demonstrate the accuracy of the system in determining optical parameters in thin tissues. We show that temporal measurements combined with MRI data can be used to accurately quantify optical properties in heterogeneous tissues.;2009;10.1117/12.822557
C;Concept and setup for intraoperative imaging of tumorous tissue via Attenuated Total Reflection spectrosocopy with Quantum Cascade Lasers;"A major challenge in tumor surgery is the differentiation between normal and malignant tissue. Since an incompletely resected tumor easily leads to recidivism, the gold standard is to remove malignant tissue with a sufficient safety margin and send it to pathology for examination with patho-histological techniques (rapid section diagnosis). This approach, however, exhibits several disadvantages: The removal of additional tissue (safety margin) means additional stress to the patient; the correct interpretation of proper tumor excision relies on the pathologist's experience and the waiting time between resection and pathological result can be more than 45 minutes. This last aspect implies unnecessary occupation of cost-intensive operating room staff as well as longer anesthesia for the patient. Various research groups state that hyperspectral imaging in the mid-infrared, especially in the so called fingerprint region, allows spatially resolved discrimination between normal and malignant tissue. All these experiments, though, took place in a laboratory environment and were conducted on dried, ex vivo tissue and on a microscopic scale. It is therefore our aim to develop a system incorporating the following properties: Intraoperatively and in vivo applicable, measurement time shorter than one minute, based on mid infrared spectroscopy, providing both spectral and spatial information and no use of external fluorescence markers. Theoretical assessment of different concepts and experimental studies show that a setup based on a tunable Quantum Cascade Laser and Attenuated Total Reflection seems feasible for in vivo tissue discrimination via imaging. This is confirmed by experiments with a first demonstrator.";2015;10.1117/12.2081837
J;Multispectral optoacoustic tomography of the human breast: characterisation of healthy tissue and malignant lesions using a hybrid ultrasound-optoacoustic approach;Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) represents a new in vivo imaging technique with high resolution (similar to 250 mu m) and tissue penetration (> 1 cm) using the photoacoustic effect. While ultrasound contains anatomical information for lesion detection, MSOT provides functional information based on intrinsic tissue chromophores. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of combined ultrasound/MSOT imaging of breast cancer in patients compared to healthy volunteers. Imaging was performed using a handheld MSOT system for clinical use in healthy volunteers (n = 6) and representative patients with histologically confirmed invasive breast carcinoma (n = 5) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS, n = 2). MSOT values for haemoglobin and oxygen saturation were assessed at 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 cm depth and selected wavelengths between 700 and 850 nm. Reproducible signals were obtained in all wavelengths with consistent MSOT signals in superficial tissue in breasts of healthy individuals. In contrast, we found increased signals for haemoglobin in invasive carcinoma, suggesting a higher perfusion of the tumour and tumour environment. For DCIS, MSOT values showed only little variation compared to healthy tissue. This preliminary MSOT breast imaging study provided stable, reproducible data on tissue composition and physiological properties, potentially enabling differentiation of solid malignant and healthy tissue. aEuro cent A handheld MSOT probe enables real-time molecular imaging of the breast. aEuro cent MSOT of healthy controls provides a reproducible reference for pathology identification. aEuro cent MSOT parameters allows for differentiation of invasive carcinoma and healthy tissue.;2018;10.1007/s00330-017-5002-x
J;Hyperspectral Imaging of Wounds Reveals Augmented Tissue Oxygenation Following Cold Physical Plasma Treatment in Vivo;Efficient vascularization of skin tissue supports wound healing in response to injury. This includes elevated blood circulation, tissue oxygenation, and perfusion. Cold physical plasma promotes wound healing in animal models and humans. Physical plasmas are multicomponent systems that generate several physicochemical effectors, such as ions, electrons, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and UV radiation. However, the consequences of plasma treatment on wound oxygenation and perfusion, vital processes to promote tissue regeneration, are largely unexplored. We used a novel hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system and a murine dermal full-thickness wound model in combination with kINPen argon plasma jet treatment to address this question. Plasma treatment promoted tissue oxygenation in superficial as well as deep (6 mm) layers of wound tissue. In addition to perfusion changes, we found a wound healing stage-dependent shift of tissue hemoglobin and tissue water index during reactive species-driven wound healing. Contactless, fast monitoring of medical parameters in real-time using HSI revealed a plasma-supporting effect in wound healing together with precise information about biological surface-specific features.;2021;10.1109/TRPMS.2020.3009913
J;Spectral-spatial classification for noninvasive cancer detection using hyperspectral imaging;Early detection of malignant lesions could improve both survival and quality of life of cancer patients. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has emerged as a powerful tool for noninvasive cancer detection and diagnosis, with the advantage of avoiding tissue biopsy and providing diagnostic signatures without the need of a contrast agent in real time. We developed a spectral-spatial classification method to distinguish cancer from normal tissue on hyperspectral images. We acquire hyperspectral reflectance images from 450 to 900 nm with a 2-nm increment from tumor-bearing mice. In our animal experiments, the HSI and classification method achieved a sensitivity of 93.7% and a specificity of 91.3%. The preliminary study demonstrated that HSI has the potential to be applied in vivo for noninvasive detection of tumors.

C;In-vivo optical investigation of Psoriasis;Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease of the skin characterized by hyperkeratosis, hyperproliferation of the epidermis, inflammatory cell accumulation and increased dilatation of dermal papillary blood vessels. Cases of psoriasis were investigated in vivo with optical means in order to evaluate the potential of in vivo optical biopsy. A Polarization Multispectral Dermoscope was employed for the macroscopic observation. Features such as the 'dotted' blood vessels pattern was observed with high contrast. The average size of dot vessels in Psoriasis was measured to be 974 mu m(2) which is much higher compared to healthy skin. High resolution image sections of the epidermis and the dermis were produced with a custom made Multiphoton Microscope. Imaging extended from the surface of the lesion down to the papillary dermis, at a depth of 200 mu m. In the epidermis, a characteristic morphology of the stratum corneum found only in Psoriasis was revealed. Additionally, the cytoplasmic area of the cells in the stratum spinosum layer was found to be smaller than normal. In the dermis the morphological features were more pronounced, where the elongated dermal papillae dominated the papillary layer. Their length exceeds 100 mu m, which is a far greater value compared to that of healthy skin. These in vivo observations are consistent with the ex vivo histopathological observations, supporting both the applicability and potentiality of multispectral dermoscopy and multiphoton microscopy in the field of in vivo optical investigation and biopsy of skin.;2011;10.1117/12.874723
J;Detection of microspheres in vivo using multispectral optoacoustic tomography;We introduce a new approach to detect individual microparticles that contain NIR fluorescent dye by multispectral optoacoustic tomography in the context of the hemoglobin-rich environment within murine liver. We encapsulated a near infrared (NIR) fluorescent dye within polystyrene microspheres, then injected them into the ileocolic vein, which drains to the liver. NIR absorption was determined using multispectral optoacoustic tomography. To quantitate the minimum diameter of microspheres, we used both colorimetric and spatial information to segment the regions in which the microspheres appear. Regional diameter was estimated by doubling the maximum regional distance. We found that the minimum microsphere size threshold for detection by multispectral optoacoustic tomography images is 78.9 mu m.;2017;10.1080/10520295.2016.1251611
C;In vivo measurement and modeling of multispectral reflectance images for melanoma diagnosis;Noninvasive detection of malignant melanoma in early stages is critical to improve patients' prognosis. We acquired in vivo reflectance images of dysplastic lesions from 12 patients at 31 wavelengths from 500 to 950nm. Based on these image data, we developed a parallel Monte Carlo code to simulate reflectance images from a heterogeneous skin tissue model. With this tool, we have investigated the dependence of the lesion contrast in the reflectance image on the heterogeneous distribution of tissue optical parameters. The Monte Carlo model is currently used to generate multispectral reflectance imaging data for multivariate analysis of the in vivo imaging data.;2007;
J;Multispectral fingerprinting for improved in vivo cell dynamics analysis;Background: Tracing cell dynamics in the embryo becomes tremendously difficult when cell trajectories cross in space and time and tissue density obscure individual cell borders. Here, we used the chick neural crest (NC) as a model to test multicolor cell labeling and multispectral confocal imaging strategies to overcome these roadblocks. Results: We found that multicolor nuclear cell labeling and multispectral imaging led to improved resolution of in vivo NC cell identification by providing a unique spectral identity for each cell. NC cell spectral identity allowed for more accurate cell tracking and was consistent during short term time-lapse imaging sessions. Computer model simulations predicted significantly better object counting for increasing cell densities in 3-color compared to 1-color nuclear cell labeling. To better resolve cell contacts, we show that a combination of 2-color membrane and 1-color nuclear cell labeling dramatically improved the semi-automated analysis of NC cell interactions, yet preserved the ability to track cell movements. We also found channel versus lambda scanning of multicolor labeled embryos significantly reduced the time and effort of image acquisition and analysis of large 3D volume data sets. Conclusions: Our results reveal that multicolor cell labeling and multispectral imaging provide a cellular fingerprint that may uniquely determine a cell's position within the embryo. Together, these methods offer a spectral toolbox to resolve in vivo cell dynamics in unprecedented detail.;2010;10.1186/1471-213X-10-101
J;Application of multispectral imaging detects areas with neuronal myelin loss, without tissue labelling;The application of multispectral imaging to discriminate myelinated and demyelinated areas of neural tissue is herein presented. The method is applied through a custom-made, multispectral imaging monochromator, coupled to a commercially available microscope. In the present work, a series of spinal cord sections were analysed derived from mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an experimental model widely used to study multiple sclerosis (MS). The multispectral microscope allows imaging of local areas with loss of myelin without the need of tissue labelling. Imaging with the aforementioned method and system is compared in a parallel way with conventional methods (wide-field and confocal fluorescence microscopies). The diagnostic sensitivity of our method is 90.4% relative to the 'gold standard' method of immunofluorescence microscopy. The presented method offers a new platform for the possible future development of an in vivo, real-time, non-invasive, rapid imaging diagnostic tool of spinal cord myelin loss-derived pathologies.;2016;10.1093/jmicro/dfv349
J;Comparison of fluorescence lifetime and multispectral imaging for quantitative multiplexing in biological tissue;Fluorescence lifetime (FLT) multiplexing and multispectral imaging (MSI) are both frequently employed for in vitro and ex vivo biological studies. In vivo applications of MSI for deep seated fluorophores require consideration of diffusive light propagation in biological tissue. We have previously shown that a well-known redshift of fluorescence spectra in diffusive medium induces a fluorophore cross-talk, which cannot be accounted for even with known optical properties of the medium. In contrast, FLT measurements remain largely unaffected by light propagation in tissue, enabling zero cross-talk and accurate relative quantification. While a fully quantitative estimation of fluorophore concentrations requires depth resolved tomographic imaging, this is often not possible due to the difficulty of estimating tissue optical properties and modelling light propagation in complex tissue geometries. Here, we experimentally investigate the performance of planar (non-tomographic) MSI and FLT multiplexing for the quantitative recovery of multiple near-infrared fluorophores embedded in 4-8 mm thick tissue. We show that FLT multiplexing provides a superior quantification accuracy (error < 10%) compared to MSI (error = 20-107%) in tissue. The error rates for MSI increased with tissue thickness and can be directly attributed to the spectral redshift induced cross-talk between emission spectra. Our data indicate that planar FLT multiplexing can provide high quantification accuracy in thick biological tissue without a need for optical property estimation, thereby offering an important validation tool for rapid quantification of fluorophore concentrations in bulk tissue.

J;Flexible endoscope for continuous in vivo multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging;Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) offers a noninvasive approach for characterizing the biochemical composition of biological tissue. There has been an increasing interest in the application of multispectral FLIM for medical diagnosis. Central to the clinical translation of FLIM technology is the development of compact and high-speed endoscopy systems. Unfortunately, the predominant multispectral FLIM approaches suffer from limitations that impede the development of endoscopy systems that are suitable for in vivo tissue imaging. We present a compact wide-field time-gated FLIM flexible endoscope capable of continuous lifetime imaging of up to three fluorescence emission bands simultaneously. This endoscope design will facilitate the evaluation of FLIM for in vivo applications. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America;2013;10.1364/OL.38.001515
J;Label-free photoacoustic tomography of whole mouse brain structures ex vivo;"Capitalizing on endogenous hemoglobin contrast, photoacoustic-computed tomography (PACT), a deep-tissue high-resolution imaging modality, has drawn increasing interest in neuroimaging. However, most existing studies are limited to functional imaging on the cortical surface and the deep brain structural imaging capability of PACT has never been demonstrated. Here, we explicitly studied the limiting factors of deep brain PACT imaging. We found that the skull distorted the acoustic signal and blood suppressed the structural contrast from other chromophores. When the two effects are mitigated, PACT can potentially provide high-resolution label-free imaging of structures in the entire mouse brain. With 100-mu m in-plane resolution, we can clearly identify major structures of the brain, which complements magnetic resonance microscopy for imaging small-animal brain structures. Spectral PACT studies indicate that structural contrasts mainly originate from cytochrome distribution and that the presence of lipid sharpens the image contrast; brain histology results provide further validation. The feasibility of imaging the structure of the brain in vivo is also discussed. Our results demonstrate that PACT is a promising modality for both structural and functional brain imaging.

J;A multispectral microscope for in vivo oximetry of rat dorsal spinal cord vasculature;"Quantification of blood oxygen saturation (SO2) in vivo is essential for understanding the pathogenesis of diseases in which hypoxia is thought to play a role, including inflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We describe a low-cost multispectral microscope and oximetry technique for calibration-free absolute oximetry of surgically exposed blood vessels in vivo. We imaged the vasculature of the dorsal spinal cord in healthy rats, and varied inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the imaging system to changes in SO2. The venous SO2 was calculated as 67.8 +/- 10.4% (average +/- standard deviation), increasing to 83.1 +/- 11.6% under hyperoxic conditions (100% FiO(2)) and returning to 67.4 +/- 10.9% for a second normoxic period; the venous SO2 was 50.9 +/- 15.5% and 29.2 +/- 24.6% during subsequent hypoxic states (18% and 15% FiO(2) respectively). We discuss the design and performance of our multispectral imaging system, and the future scope for extending this oximetry technique to quantification of hypoxia in inflamed tissue.";2017;10.1088/1361-6579/aa5527
C;Use of spectral imaging for documentation of skin parameters in face lift procedure;In rhytidectomy the postoperative edema (swelling) and ecchymosis (bruising) can influence the cosmetic results. Evaluation of edema has typically been performed by visual inspection by a trained physician using a four-level or, more commonly, a two-level grading(1). Few instruments exist capable of quantitatively assessing edema and ecchymosis in skin. Here we demonstrate that edema and ecchymosis can be objectively quantitated in vivo by a multispectral clinical imaging system (MSCIS). After a feasibility study of induced stasis to the forearms of volunteers and a benchtop study of an edema model, five subjects undergoing rhytidectomy were recruited for a clinical study and multispectral images were taken approximately at days 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 15, 22 and 29 (according with the day of their visit). Apparent concentrations of oxy-hemoglobin, deoxy-hemoglobin (ecchymosis), melanin, scattering and water (edema) were calculated for each pixel of a spectral image stack. From the blue channel on cross-polarized images bilirubin was extracted. These chromophore maps are two-dimensional quantitative representations of the involved skin areas that demonstrated characteristics of the recovery process of the patient after the procedure. We conclude that multispectral imaging can be a valuable noninvasive tool in the study of edema and ecchymosis and can be used to document these chromophores in vivo and determine the efficacy of treatments in a clinical setting.;2010;10.1117/12.848213
C;An interventional multispectral photoacoustic imaging platform for the guidance of minimally invasive procedures;Precise and efficient guidance of medical devices is of paramount importance for many minimally invasive procedures. These procedures include fetal interventions, tumor biopsies and treatments, central venous catheterisations and peripheral nerve blocks. Ultrasound imaging is commonly used for guidance, but it often provides insufficient contrast with which to identify soft tissue structures such as vessels, tumors, and nerves. In this study, a hybrid interventional imaging system that combines ultrasound imaging and multispectral photoacoustic imaging for guiding minimally invasive procedures was developed and characterized. The system provides both structural information from ultrasound imaging and molecular information from multispectral photoacoustic imaging. It uses a commercial linear-array ultrasound imaging probe as the ultrasound receiver, with a multimode optical fiber embedded in a needle to deliver pulsed excitation light to tissue. Co-registration of ultrasound and photoacoustic images is achieved with the use of the same ultrasound receiver for both modalities. Using tissue ex vivo, the system successfully discriminated deep-located fat tissue from the surrounding muscle tissue. The measured photoacoustic spectrum of the fat tissue had good agreement with the lipid spectrum in literature.;2015;10.1117/12.2183798
J;A clinically translatable hyperspectral endoscopy (HySE) system for imaging the gastrointestinal tract;"Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) enables visualisation of morphological and biochemical information, which could improve disease diagnostic accuracy. Unfortunately, the wide range of image distortions that arise during flexible endoscopy in the clinic have made integration of HSI challenging. To address this challenge, we demonstrate a hyperspectral endoscope (HySE) that simultaneously records intrinsically co-registered hyperspectral and standard-ofcare white light images, which allows image distortions to be compensated computationally and an accurate hyperspectral data cube to be reconstructed as the endoscope moves in the lumen. Evaluation of HySE performance shows excellent spatial, spectral and temporal resolution and high colour fidelity. Application of HySE enables: quantification of blood oxygenation levels in tissue mimicking phantoms; differentiation of spectral profiles from normal and pathological ex vivo human tissues; and recording of hyperspectral data under freehand motion within an intact ex vivo pig oesophagus model. HySE therefore shows potential for enabling HSI in clinical endoscopy.";2019;10.1038/s41467-019-09484-4
C;In-vivo tissue imaging using a compact mobile non-linear microscope;We have built a compact flexible non-linear microscope equipped with a combination of different non-linear laser imaging techniques including two-photon fluorescence, second-harmonic generation, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, and multispectral two-photon emission detection. The system is composed of a microscope head, containing both scanning and detection system, as well as the electronic and electro-mechanical devices, optically relayed to the laser source with a seven-mirror articulated arm. The particular mirror positioning inside the arm allows to move the microscope head maintaining the optical alignment of the system. The microscope head is composed by two ErGaAl anodized boards, one for laser scanning and the other for signal detection. System performances were characterized by means of point spread function and instrument response function measurements as well as by spatial, temporal, and spectral calibration. The instrument, offering high spatial (up to 300 nm) and temporal (up to 300 ps) resolution, was tested on in-vivo skin imaging of both cellular epidermis and connective dermis. Lifetime and spectral features of fluorescence were used for differentiating epidermal layers by means of fluorescence lifetime and for scoring skin ageing through spectral detection of both second-harmonic and two-photon fluorescence.;2010;10.1117/12.841752
C;Angular Domain Spectroscopic Imaging of Turbid Media: Derivative Analysis;Angular Domain Spectroscopic Imaging employs an array of micro-channels to perform angular filtering of light that traverses a turbid sample to reject moderately to highly scattered light. In this work, we experimentally characterized an ADSI system by measuring transmission spectra and the first and second derivatives obtained from absorbing and scattering targets. The derivative analysis was used to estimate the concentration of indocyanine green mixed in a scattering liquid. The experimental results provided support for ADSI as a potential method for quantitative spectroscopic imaging of ex vivo tissue samples.;2011;10.1117/12.874351
C;Assessing carotid atherosclerosis by fiber-optic multispectral photoacoustic tomography;Atherosclerotic plaque at the carotid bifurcation is the underlying cause of the majority of ischemic strokes. Noninvasive imaging and quantification of the compositional changes preceding gross anatomic changes within the arterial wall is essential for diagnosis of disease. Current imaging modalities such as duplex ultrasound, computed tomography, positron emission tomography are limited by the lack of compositional contrast and the detection of flow-limiting lesions. Although high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging has been developed to characterize atherosclerotic plaque composition, its accessibility for wide clinical use is limited. Here, we demonstrate a fiber-based multispectral photoacoustic tomography system for excitation of lipids and external acoustic detection of the generated ultrasound. Using sequential ultrasound imaging of ex vivo preparations we achieved similar to 2 cm imaging depth and chemical selectivity for assessment of human arterial plaques. A multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares analysis method was applied to resolve the major chemical components, including intravascular lipid, intramuscular fat, and blood. These results show the promise of detecting carotid plaque in vivo through esophageal fiber-optic excitation of lipids and external acoustic detection of the generated ultrasound. This imaging system has great potential for serving as a point-ofcare device for early diagnosis of carotid artery disease in the clinic.;2015;10.1117/12.2076999
J;Deep Learning-Based Spectral Unmixing for Optoacoustic Imaging of Tissue Oxygen Saturation;Label free imaging of oxygenation distribution in tissues is highly desired in numerous biomedical applications, but is still elusive, in particular in sub-epidermal measurements. Eigenspectra multispectral optoacoustic tomography (eMSOT) and its Bayesian-based implementation have been introduced to offer accurate label-free blood oxygen saturation (sO(2)) maps in tissues. The method uses the eigenspectra model of light fluence in tissue to account for the spectral changes due to the wavelength dependent attenuation of light with tissue depth. eMSOT relies on the solution of an inverse problem bounded by a number of ad hoc hand-engineered constraints. Despite the quantitative advantage offered by eMSOT, both the non-convex nature of the optimization problem and the possible sub-optimality of the constraints may lead to reduced accuracy. We present herein a neural network architecture that is able to learn how to solve the inverse problem of eMSOT by directly regressing from a set of input spectra to the desired fluence values. The architecture is composed of a combination of recurrent and convolutional layers and uses both spectral and spatial features for inference. We train an ensemble of such networks using solely simulated data and demonstrate how this approach can improve the accuracy of sO(2) computation over the original eMSOT, not only in simulations but also in experimental datasets obtained from blood phantoms and small animals (mice) in vivo. The use of a deep-learning approach in optoacoustic sO(2) imaging is confirmed herein for the first time on ground truth sO(2) values experimentally obtained in vivo and ex vivo.;2020;10.1109/TMI.2020.3001750
J;Bayesian Estimation of Intrinsic Tissue Oxygenation and Perfusion From RGB Images;Multispectral imaging (MSI) can potentially assist the intra-operative assessment of tissue structure, function and viability, by providing information about oxygenation. In this paper, we present a novel technique for recovering intrinsic MSI measurements from endoscopic RGB images without custom hardware adaptations. The advantage of this approach is that it requires no modification to existing surgical and diagnostic endoscopic imaging systems. Our method uses a radiometric color calibration of the endoscopic camera's sensor in conjunction with a Bayesian framework to recover a per-pixel measurement of the total blood volume (THb) and oxygen saturation (SO2) in the observed tissue. The sensor's pixel measurements are modeled as weighted sums over a mixture of Poisson distributions and we optimize the variables SO2 and THb to maximize the likelihood of the observations. To validate our technique, we use synthetic images generated from Monte Carlo physics simulation of light transport through soft tissue containing sub-surface blood vessels. We also validate our method on in vivo data by comparing it to a MSI dataset acquired with a hardware system that sequentially images multiple spectral bands without overlap. Our results are promising and show that we are able to provide surgeons with additional relevant information by processing endoscopic images with our modeling and inference framework.;2017;10.1109/TMI.2017.2665627
J;Visible reflectance hyperspectral imaging: Characterization of a noninvasive, in vivo system for determining tissue perfusion;We characterize a visible reflectance hyperspectral imaging system for noninvasive, in vivo, quantitative analysis of human tissue in a clinical environment. The subject area is illuminated with a quartz-tungsten-halogen light source, and the reflected light is spectrally discriminated by a liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF) and imaged onto a silicon charge-coupled device detector. The LCTF is continuously tunable within its useful visible spectral range (525-725 nm) with an average spectral full width at half-height bandwidth of 0.38 nm and an average transmittance of 10.0%. A standard resolution target placed 5.5 ft from the system results in a field of view with a 17-cm diameter and an optimal spatial resolution of 0.45 mm. The measured reflectance spectra are quantified in terms of apparent absorbance and formatted as a hyperspectral image cube. As a clinical example, we examine a model of vascular dysfunction involving both ischemia and reactive hyperemia during tissue reperfusion. In this model, spectral images, based upon oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoblobin signals in the 525-645-nm region, are deconvoluted using a multivariate least-squares regression analysis to visualize the spatial distribution of the percentages of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin in specific skin tissue areas.;2002;10.1021/ac011275f
J;Multispectral imaging of absorption and scattering properties of in vivo exposed rat brain using a digital red-green-blue camera;In order to estimate multispectral images of the absorption and scattering properties in the cerebral cortex of in vivo rat brain, we investigated spectral reflectance images estimated by the Wiener estimation method using a digital RGB camera. A Monte Carlo simulation-based multiple regression analysis for the corresponding spectral absorbance images at nine wavelengths (500, 520, 540, 560, 570, 580, 600, 730, and 760 nm) was then used to specify the absorption and scattering parameters of brain tissue. In this analysis, the concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin and that of deoxygenated hemoglobin were estimated as the absorption parameters, whereas the coefficient a and the exponent b of the reduced scattering coefficient spectrum approximated by a power law function were estimated as the scattering parameters. The spectra of absorption and reduced scattering coefficients were reconstructed from the absorption and scattering parameters, and the spectral images of absorption and reduced scattering coefficients were then estimated. In order to confirm the feasibility of this method, we performed in vivo experiments on exposed rat brain. The estimated images of the absorption coefficients were dominated by the spectral characteristics of hemoglobin. The estimated spectral images of the reduced scattering coefficients had a broad scattering spectrum, exhibiting a larger magnitude at shorter wavelengths, corresponding to the typical spectrum of brain tissue published in the literature. The changes in the estimated absorption and scattering parameters during normoxia, hyperoxia, and anoxia indicate the potential applicability of the method by which to evaluate the pathophysiological conditions of in vivo brain due to the loss of tissue viability.

C;INFRARED HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING FOR ENHANCED TISSUE VISUALIZATION AND DISCRIMINATION DURING SURGICAL OPERATION;A new hyperspectral imaging system has been designed in infrared 950 nm - 1700 nm spectral range to be integrated in operating rooms in order to detect some vital and anatomical tissues, hardly noticeable by the surgeon's naked eye during surgical interventions. The main objective of this exploratory study is to find the best three relevant bands to create a RGB image that maximizes the contrast between the target tissue and its surroundings. One of the main challenges in HSI processing is the dimensionality reduction step which was carried out using band transformation and band selection methods in order to remove redundancy in the collected data without losing valuable information. Preclinical experiments were performed in vivo in a porcine ureter. Objective and comparative evaluations, based on the simulated perceived image, were performed between five methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method that combines two band selection methods has the best performance to enhance surgeon's visual skills.;2014;
C;DLP Hyperspectral Imaging for Surgical and Clinical Utility;We describe a novel digital light processing, DLP hyperspectral imaging system for visualizing chemical composition of in vivo tissues during surgical procedures non-invasively and at near video rate. The novelty of the DLP hyperspectral imaging system resides in (1) its ability to conform light to rapidly sweep through a series of preprogrammed spectral illuminations as simple as a set of contiguous bandpasses to any number of complex spectra, and (2) processing the reflected spectroscopic image data using unique supervised and unsupervised chemometric methods that color encode molecular content of tissue at each image detector pixel providing an optical biopsy. Spectral illumination of tissue is accomplished utilizing a DLP (R) based spectral illuminator incorporating a series of bandpass spectra and measuring the reflectance image with a CCD array detector. Wavelength dependent images are post processed with a multivariate least squares analysis method using known reference spectra of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin. Alternatively, illuminating with complex reference spectra reduces the number of spectral images required for generating chemically relevant images color encoded for relative percentage of oxyhemoglobin are collected and displayed in real time near-video rate, (3 to 4) frames per second (fps). As a proof of principle application, a kidney of an anesthetized pig was imaged before and after renal vasculature occlusion showing the clamped kidney to be 61% of the unclamped kidney percentage of oxyhemoglobin. Using the 3-Shot spectral illumination method and gathering data at (3 to 4) fps shows a non-linear exponential de-oxygenation of hemoglobin reaching steady state within 30 seconds post occlusion.;2009;10.1117/12.810068
J;High-speed multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging implementation for in vivo applications;Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) offers a noninvasive approach for characterizing the biochemical composition of biological tissue. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the application of multi-spectral FLIM for medical diagnosis. Central to the clinical translation of FLIM technology is the development of robust, fast, and cost-effective FLIM instrumentation suitable for in vivo tissue imaging. Unfortunately, the predominant multispectral FLIM approaches suffer from limitations that impede the development of high-speed instruments for in vivo applications. We present a cost-effective scanning multispectral FLIM implementation capable of achieving pixel rates on the order of tens of kilohertz, which will facilitate the evaluation of FLIM for in vivo applications.

J;Multispectral imaging autofluorescence microscopy for the analysis of lymph-node tissues;"Although histochemical and immunohistochemical methods are the standard procedures in diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorders, useful improvements in evidencing histopathologic manifestations can be obtained with the introduction of tissue autofluorescence analyses. We used microspectrofluorometry and a Multispectral Imaging Autofluorescence Microscopy (MIAM) technique to analyze lymph-node biopsies from patients with lymphoadenopathy of different origins. Images of tissue autofluorescence were obtained by excitation at 365 nm of lymph-node sections and sequential detection with interference filters (50 mm bandwidth) peaked at 450, 550 and 658 mm. Monochrome images were combined together in a single red-green-blue color image. Most of the fluorescence was observed within the blue spectral band because of large contributions from extracellular collagen and elastin fibers as well as from reduced form of intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate). Autofluorescence imaging shows morphological differences between neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissues. The reactive hyperplasia samples show the typical lymph-node organization with weak fluorescent follicles separated by high fluorescent connective trabeculae. In the neoplastic lymph nodes the loss of follicle organization is observed. Consequently, IMAM permits to discriminate between non-neoplastic and neoplastic tissues on the basis of their autofluorescence pattern. Multispectral imaging of tissue autofluorescence may present some advantages with respect to standard histochemical microscopy since it (1) does not require any chemical manipulation of samples; (2) gives real-time results performing the analysis immediately upon specimen resection; and (3) supplies a representation of the biological structure organization linked to endogenous fluorophores.";2000;"10.1562/0031-8655(2000)071<0737:MIAMFT>2.0.CO;2"
C;Visible, hyperspectral imaging evaluating the cutaneous response to ultraviolet radiation;In vivo diagnostics of skin diseases as well as understanding of the skin biology constitute a field demanding characterization of physiological and anatomical parameters. Biomedical optics has been successfully used to qualitatively and quantitatively estimate the microcirculatory conditions of superficial skin. Capillaroscopy, laser Doppler techniques and spectroscopy, all elucidate different aspects of microcirculation, e.g. capillary anatomy and distribution, tissue perfusion and hemoglobin oxygenation. We demonstrate the use of a diffuse reflectance hyperspectral imaging system for spatial and temporal characterization of tissue oxygenation, important to skin viability. The system comprises: light source, liquid crystal tunable filter, camera objective, CCD camera, and the decomposition of the spectral signature into relative amounts of oxy- and deoxygenized hemoglobin as well as melanin in every pixel resulting in tissue chromophore images. To validate the system, we used a phototesting model, creating a graded inflammatory response of a known geometry, in order to evaluate the ability to register spatially resolved reflectance spectra. The obtained results demonstrate the possibility to describe the UV inflammatory response by calculating the change in tissue oxygen level, intimately connected to a tissue's metabolism. Preliminary results on the estimation of melanin content are also presented.;2007;10.1117/12.698165
J;Polarization-Sensitive Hyperspectral Imaging in vivo: A Multimode Dermoscope for Skin Analysis;Attempts to understand the changes in the structure and physiology of human skin abnormalities by non-invasive optical imaging are aided by spectroscopic methods that quantify, at the molecular level, variations in tissue oxygenation and melanin distribution. However, current commercial and research systems to map hemoglobin and melanin do not correlate well with pathology for pigmented lesions or darker skin. We developed a multimode dermoscope that combines polarization and hyperspectral imaging with an efficient analytical model to map the distribution of specific skin bio-molecules. This corrects for the melanin-hemoglobin misestimation common to other systems, without resorting to complex and computationally intensive tissue optical models. For this system's proof of concept, human skin measurements on melanocytic nevus, vitiligo, and venous occlusion conditions were performed in volunteers. The resulting molecular distribution maps matched physiological and anatomical expectations, confirming a technologic approach that can be applied to next generation dermoscopes and having biological plausibility that is likely to appeal to dermatologists.;2014;10.1038/srep04924
J;Multispectral Photoacoustic Tomography and Its Development in Biomedical Application;Multispectral photoacoustic tomography is one of the macroscopic observation methods combining multispectral imaging with photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) technology. Based on the specific spectral absorption characteristics of different biological tissue, the technology illuminates the tissue with multiple sets of short pulse laser of different wavelengths to produce tissue-specific photoacoustic signal for better photoacoustic imaging and component identification. MSOT combines the high sensitivity and resolution of optical imaging with the ability of the several centimeters deep-tissue imaging by ultrasound imaging, while compensated for the depth limitation of optical imaging and the low contrast of ultrasound imaging. Thus it enables noninvasive real-time imaging in the deep tissue with high-resolution and high-contrast, large penetration depths. Over the last years, MSOT has been applied to detecting the light-absorbing particles within the tumor, evaluating vascular structures and blood oxygenation, imaging the biological fluorescent protein and preliminary studies on the breast cancer patients. With the continuous improvement of photoacoustic imaging system, multispectral photoacoustic imaging technology combined with biomarkers 9such as fluorescent reagents, gold particles, etc.) has vast applications in biomedical field, especially to molecular imaging in vivo. In this paper, we gives a brief count of the imaging principle, experimental setup and the performance characteristics of MOST. Furthermore, we mainly summarizes the progress of its latest applications in the biomedical field, particularly in the angiogenesis imaging, early diagnosis of cancer and tumors in situ imaging.;2015;10.7536/PC150348
C;Optimization of wavelengths set for multispectral reflectance imaging of rat olfactory bulb activation in vivo;Wide field multispectral imaging of light backscattered by brain tissues provides maps of hemodynamics changes (total blood volume and oxygenation) following activation. This technique relies on the fit of the reflectance images obtain at two or more wavelengths using a modified Beer-Lambert law(1,2). It has been successfully applied to study the activation of several sensory cortices in the anesthetized rodent using visible light(1-5). We have carried out recently the first multispectral imaging in the olfactory bulb(6) (OB) of anesthetized rats. However, the optimization of wavelengths choice has not been discussed in terms of cross talk and uniqueness of the estimated parameters (blood volume and saturation maps) although this point was shown to be crucial for similar studies in Diffuse Optical Imaging in humans(7-10). We have studied theoretically and experimentally the optimal sets of wavelength for multispectral imaging of rodent brain activation in the visible. Sets of optimal wavelengths have been identified and validated in vivo for multispectral imaging of the OB of rats following odor stimulus. We studied the influence of the wavelengths sets on the magnitude and time courses of the oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin concentration variations as well as on the spatial extent of activated brain areas following stimulation. Beyond the estimation of hemodynamic parameters from multispectral reflectance data, we observed repeatedly and for all wavelengths a decrease of light reflectance. For wavelengths longer than 590 nm, these observations differ from those observed in the somatosensory and barrel cortex and question the basis of the reflectance changes during activation in the OB. To solve this issue, Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) have been carried out to assess the relative contribution of absorption, scattering and anisotropy changes to the intrinsic optical imaging signals in somatosensory cortex (SsC) and OB model.;2012;10.1117/12.922566
J;Multispectral upconversion luminescence intensity ratios for ascertaining the tissue imaging depth;Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have in recent years emerged as excellent contrast agents for in vivo luminescence imaging of deep tissues. But information abstracted from these images is in most cases restricted to 2-dimensions, without the depth information. In this work, a simple method has been developed to accurately ascertain the tissue imaging depth based on the relative luminescence intensity ratio of multispectral NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ UCNPs. A theoretical mode was set up, where the parameters in the quantitative relation between the relative intensities of the upconversion luminescence spectra and the depth of the UCNPs were determined using tissue mimicking liquid phantoms. The 540 nm and 650 nm luminescence intensity ratios (G/R ratio) of NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ UCNPs were monitored following excitation path (Ex mode) and emission path (Em mode) schemes, respectively. The model was validated by embedding NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ UCNPs in layered pork muscles, which demonstrated a very high accuracy of measurement in the thickness up to centimeter. This approach shall promote significantly the power of nanotechnology in medical optical imaging by expanding the imaging information from 2-dimensional to real 3-dimensional.;2014;10.1039/c4nr02090a
J;Combining multispectral polarized light imaging and confocal microscopy for localization of nonmelanoma skin cancer;Multispectral polarized light imaging (MSPLI) enables rapid inspection of a superficial tissue layer over large surfaces, but does not provide information on cellular microstructure. Confocal microscopy (CM) allows imaging within turbid media with resolution comparable to that of histology, but suffers from a small field of view. In practice, pathologists use microscopes at low and high power to view tumor margins and cell features, respectively. Therefore, we study the combination of CM and MSPLI for demarcation of nonmelanoma skin cancers. Freshly excised thick skin samples with nonmelanoma cancers are rapidly stained with either toluidine or methylene blue dyes, rinsed in acetic acid, and imaged using MSPLI and CM. MSPLI is performed at 630, 660, and 750 nm. The same specimens are imaged by reflectance CM at 630, 660, and 830 nm. Results indicate that CM and MSPLI images are in good correlation with histopathology. Cytological features are identified by CM, and tumor margins are delineated by MSPLI. A combination of MSPLI and CM appears to be complementary. This combined in situ technique has potential to guide cancer surgery more rapidly and at lower cost than conventional histopathology.

J;In vivo imaging of cancer cells with electroporation of quantum dots and multispectral imaging;Our understanding of dissemination and growth of cancer cells is limited by our inability for long-term followup of this process in vivo. Fluorescence molecular imaging has the potential to track cancer cells with high contrast and sensitivity in living animals. For this purpose, intracellular delivery of near-infrared fluorescence quantum dots (QDs) by electroporation offers considerable advantages over organic fluorophores and other cell tagging methods. In this research we developed a multispectral imaging system that could eliminate two major parameters compromising in vivo fluorescence imaging performance, i.e., variations in the tissue optical properties and tissue autofluorescence. We demonstrated that electroporation of QDs and multispectral imaging allowed in vivo assessment of cancer development and progression in the xenograft mouse tumor model for more than 1 month, providing a powerful means to learn more about the biology of cancer and metastasis.

J;Hyperspectral Imagery for Assessing Laser-Induced Thermal State Change in Liver;This work presents the potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to monitor the thermal outcome of laser ablation therapy used for minimally invasive tumor removal. Our main goal is the establishment of indicators of the thermal damage of living tissues, which can be used to assess the effect of the procedure. These indicators rely on the spectral variation of temperature-dependent tissue chromophores, i.e., oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, and water. Laser treatment was performed at specific temperature thresholds (from 60 to 110 degrees C) on in-vivo animal liver and was assessed with a hyperspectral camera (500-995 nm) during and after the treatment. The indicators were extracted from the hyperspectral images after the following processing steps: the breathing motion compensation and the spectral and spatial filtering, the selection of spectral bands corresponding to specific tissue chromophores, and the analysis of the areas under the curves for each spectral band. Results show that properly combining spectral information related to deoxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, lipids, and water allows for the segmenting of different zones of the laser-induced thermal damage. This preliminary investigation provides indicators for describing the thermal state of the liver, which can be employed in the future as clinical endpoints of the procedure outcome.;2021;10.3390/s21020643
J;Assessing diabetic foot ulcer development risk with hyperspectral tissue oximetry;Foot ulceration remains a serious health concern for diabetic patients and has a major impact on the cost of diabetes treatment. Early detection and preventive care, such as offloading or improved hygiene, can greatly reduce the risk of further complications. We aim to assess the use of hyperspectral tissue oximetry in predicting the risk of diabetic foot ulcer formation. Tissue oximetry measurements are performed during several visits with hyperspectral imaging of the feet in type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus subjects that are at risk for foot ulceration. The data are retrospectively analyzed at 21 sites that ulcerated during the course of our study and an ulceration prediction index is developed. Then, an image processing algorithm based on this index is implemented. This algorithm is able to predict tissue at risk of ulceration with a sensitivity and specificity of 95 and 80%, respectively, for images taken, on average, 58 days before tissue damage is apparent to the naked eye. Receiver operating characteristic analysis is also performed to give a range of sensitivity/specificity values resulting in a Q-value of 89%.

J;Evaluation of Tracheal Stenosis in Rabbits Using Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography;Objective: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) and multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) are evolving technologies that are capable of delivering real-time, high-resolution images of tissues. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using PAT and MSOT for detecting histology in a rabbit tracheal stenosis model.\nMethod: A total of 12 rabbits (9 stenosis and three control) were randomly divided into four groups (A, B, C and D). Each group consisted of three rabbits, which were staged at the first, fourth, and eighth weeks of stenosis progression, respectively. PAT/MSOT images and corresponding histology from these experimental animals were compared, for analyzing the morphologic features and quantitative tracheal measurements in different tracheal stenosis stage.Result: Both the PAT images and corresponding histology indicated the most severe degree of stenosis in group C. MSOT images indicated notable differences in tracheal contents of group B and D.Conclusion: This study suggests that PAT/MSOT are potentially valuable non-invasive modality which are capable of evaluating tracheal structure and function in vivo.;2022;10.3389/fbioe.2022.860305
C;Visible and near infrared autofluorescence and hyperspectral imaging spectroscopy for the investigation of colorectal lesions and detection of exogenous fluorophores;Colonoscopy is the most widely prescribed method of colonic imaging for the clinical surveillance of colorectal cancer. This white light-based imaging technique is often used for the detection of adenomatous polyps, the dysplastic precursors of cancer, that are subsequently removed to prevent progression to colonic carcinoma. However, some adenomas are diminutive and flat, making them difficult to discriminate from non-neoplastic tissue even for the most experienced of colonoscopists. We report here an optical system for performing excitation resolved visible and near-infrared (NIR) autofluorescence imaging and hyperspectral reflectance imaging for the investigation of differences in the spectral signatures between neoplastic and non-neoplastic mucosa along the gastrointestinal tract. This is demonstrated on ex vivo colorectal tissues using our multimodal laparoscopic imaging system, which consists of a supercontinuum excitation source and a digital multimirror device (DMD) for tuneable wavelength selection. We also demonstrate the discrimination of exogenous fluorophores applied to the tissue using the Isomap dimensionality reduction technique for visualisation of the acquired image data.;2009;10.1117/12.809313
J;Developing digital tissue phantoms for hyperspectral imaging of ischemic wounds;Hyperspectral imaging has the potential to achieve high spatial resolution and high functional sensitivity for non-invasive assessment of tissue oxygenation. However, clinical acceptance of hyperspectral imaging in ischemic wound assessment is hampered by its poor reproducibility, low accuracy, and misinterpreted biology. These limitations are partially caused by the lack of a traceable calibration standard. We proposed a digital tissue phantom (DTP) platform for quantitative calibration and performance evaluation of spectral wound imaging devices. The technical feasibility of such a DTP platform was demonstrated by both in vitro and in vivo experiments. The in vitro DTPs were developed based on a liquid blood phantom model. The in vivo DTPs were developed based on a porcine ischemic skin flap model. The DTPs were projected by a Hyperspectral Image Projector (HIP) with high fidelity. A wide-gap 2nd derivative oxygenation algorithm was developed to reconstruct tissue functional parameters from hyperspectral measurements. In this study, we have demonstrated not only the technical feasibility of using DTPs for quantitative calibration, evaluation, and optimization of spectral imaging devices but also its potential for ischemic wound assessment in clinical practice.

C;Multidimensional two-photon imaging of diseased skin;We used combined two photon intrinsic fluorescence (TPE), second harmonic generation microscopy (SHG), fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and multispectral two photon emission detection (MTPE) to investigate different kinds of human cutaneous ex-vivo skin lesions. Morphological and spectroscopic analyses allowed to characterize both healthy and pathological skin samples, including tumors, as well as to discriminate between healthy and diseased tissue, in a good agreement with common routine histology. In particular, we examined tissue samples from normal and pathological scar tissue (keloid), and skin tumors, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and malignant melanoma (MM). By using combined TPE-SHG microscopy we investigated morphological features of different skin regions, as BCC, tumor-stroma interface, healthy dermis, fibroblastic proliferation, and keloids. The SHG to autofluorescence aging index of dermis (SAAID) score was used to characterize each region, finding differences between BCC, healthy skin, tumor-stroma interface, keloids, and fibroblastic proliferation. Further comparative analysis of healthy skin and neoplastic samples was performed using FLIM. In particular, BCC showed a blue-shifted fluorescence emission, a higher absorption at 800 rim excitation wavelength, and a slightly longer mean fluorescence lifetime. MM showed a lifetime distribution similar to the corresponding melanocytic nevus (MN) lifetime distribution for the slow lifetime component, and different for the fast lifetime component.;2008;10.1117/12.762614
J;Improved decision making for prioritizing tumor targeting antibodies in human xenografts: Utility of fluorescence imaging to verify tumor target expression, antibody binding and optimization of dosage and application schedule;Preclinical efficacy studies of antibodies targeting a tumor-associated antigen are only justified when the expression of the relevant antigen has been demonstrated. Conventionally, antigen expression level is examined by immunohistochemistry of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue section. This method represents the diagnostic gold standard for tumor target evaluation, but is affected by a number of factors, such as epitope masking and insufficient antigen retrieval. As a consequence, variances and discrepancies in histological staining results can occur, which may influence decision-making and therapeutic outcome. To overcome these problems, we have used different fluorescence-labeled therapeutic antibodies targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family members and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) in combination with fluorescence imaging modalities to determine tumor antigen expression, drug-target interaction, and biodistribution and tumor saturation kinetics in non-small cell lung cancer xenografts. For this, whole-body fluorescence intensities of labeled antibodies, applied as a single compound or antibody mixture, were measured in Calu-1 and Calu-3 tumor-bearing mice, then ex vivo multispectral tumor tissue analysis at microscopic resolution was performed. With the aid of this simple and fast imaging method, we were able to analyze the tumor cell receptor status of HER1-3 and IGF1R, monitor the antibody-target interaction and evaluate the receptor binding sites of anti-HER2-targeting antibodies. Based on this, the most suitable tumor model, best therapeutic antibody, and optimal treatment dosage and application schedule was selected. Predictions drawn from obtained imaging data were in excellent concordance with outcome of conducted preclinical efficacy studies. Our results clearly demonstrate the great potential of combined in vivo and ex vivo fluorescence imaging for the preclinical development and characterization of monoclonal antibodies.;2017;10.1080/19420862.2016.1238996
J;In vivo detection of atherosclerotic plaque using non-contact and label-free near-infrared hyperspectral imaging;Background and aims: Detecting detailed atherosclerotic plaques is important to reduce risk factors during surgery. However, there are few methods to evaluate them during surgery. The aim of this study was to establish an in vivo, non-contact, and label-free imaging method for identifying atherosclerotic plaque lesions from outside vessels with a diffuse-reflectance near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system. Methods: NIR spectra between 1000 and 2350 nm were measured using an NIR HSI imaging system outside the exposed abdominal aorta in five Watanabe Heritable Hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits in vivo. Preprocessed data were input to a supervised machine learning algorithm called a support vector machine (SVM) to create pixel-based images that can predict atherosclerotic plaques within a vessel. The images were compared with histological findings. Results: Absorbance was significantly higher in plaques than in normal arteries at 1000-1380, 1580-1810, and 1880-2320 nm. Overall predictive performance showed a sensitivity of 0.814 +/- 0.017, a specificity of 0.836 +/- 0.020, and an accuracy of 0.827 +/- 0.008. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.905 (95% confidence interval = 0.904-0.906). Conclusions: The NIR HSI system combined with a machine learning algorithm enabled accurate detection of atherosclerotic plaques within an internal vessel with high spatial resolution from outside the vessel. The findings indicate that the NIR HSI system can provide non-contact, label-free, and precise localization of atherosclerotic plaques during vascular surgery. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J;Development and characterization of a handheld hyperspectral Raman imaging probe system for molecular characterization of tissue on mesoscopic scales;Purpose: Raman spectroscopy is a promising cancer detection technique for surgical guidance applications. It can provide quantitative information relating to global tissue properties associated with structural, metabolic, immunological, and genetic biochemical phenomena in terms of molecular species including amino acids, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acid (DNA). To date in vivo Raman spectroscopy systems mostly included probes and biopsy needles typically limited to single-point tissue interrogation over a scale between 100 and 500 microns. The development of wider field handheld systems could improve tumor localization for a range of open surgery applications including brain, ovarian, and skin cancers. Methods: Here we present a novel Raman spectroscopy implementation using a coherent imaging bundle of fibers to create a probe capable of reconstructing molecular images over mesoscopic fields of view. Detection is performed using linear scanning with a rotation mirror and an imaging spectrometer. Different slits widths were tested at the entrance of the spectrometer to optimize spatial and spectral resolution while preserving sufficient signal-to-noise ratios to detect the principal Raman tissue features. The nonbiological samples, calcite and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), were used to characterize the performance of the system. The new wide-field probe was tested on ex vivo samples of calf brain and swine tissue. Raman spectral content of both tissue types were validated with data from the literature and compared with data acquired with a single-point Raman spectroscopy probe. The single-point probe was used as the gold standard against which the new instrument was benchmarked as it has already been thoroughly validated for biological tissue characterization. Result: We have developed and characterized a practical noncontact handheld Raman imager providing tissue information at a spatial resolution of 115 microns over a field of view >14 mm(2) and a spectral resolution of 6 cm(-1) over the whole fingerprint region. Typical integration time to acquire an entire Raman image over swine tissue was set to approximately 100 s. Spectra acquired with both probes (single-point and wide-field) showed good agreement, with a Pearson correlation factor >0.85 over different tissue categories. Protein and lipid content of imaged tissue were manifested into the measured spectra which correlated well with previous findings in the literature. An example of quantitative molecular map is presented for swine tissue and calf brain based on the ratio of protein-to-lipid content showing clear delineations between white and gray matter as well as between adipose and muscle tissue. Conclusion: We presented the development of a Raman imaging probe with a field of view of a few millimeters and a spatial resolution consistent with standard surgical imaging methods using an imaging bundle. Spectra acquired with the newly developed system on swine tissue and calf brain correlated well with an establish single-point probe and observed spectral features agreed with previous finding in the literature. The imaging probe has demonstrated its ability to reconstruct molecular images of soft tissues. The approach presented here has a lot of potential for the development of surgical Raman imaging probe to guide the surgeon during cancer surgery.

J;Targeting Acidity in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma: Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography Detects pH-Low Insertion Peptide Probes In Vivo;"Background: pH-low insertion peptides (pHLIP) can serve as a targeting moiety that enables pH-sensitive probes to detect solid tumors. Using these probes in conjunction with multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is a promising approach to improve imaging for pancreatic cancer. Methods: A pH-sensitive pHLIP (V7) was conjugated to 750 NIR fluorescent dye and evaluated as a targeted probe for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The pH-insensitive K7 pHLIP served as an untargeted control. Probe binding was assessed in vitro at pH 7.4, 6.8, and 6.6 using human pancreatic cell lines S2VP10 and S2013. Using MSOT, semiquantitative probe accumulation was then assessed in vivo with a murine orthotopic pancreatic adenocarcinoma model. Results: In vitro, the V7-750 probe demonstrated significantly higher fluorescence at pH 6.6 compared with pH 7.4 (S2VP10, P = 0.0119; S2013, P = 0.0160), whereas no difference was observed with the K7-750 control (S2VP10, P = 0.8783; S2013, P = 0.921). In the in vivo S2VP10 model, V7-750 probe resulted in 782.5 MSOT a.u. signal compared with 5.3 MSOT a.u. in K7-750 control in tumor (P = 0.0001). Similarly, V7-750 probe signal was 578.3MSOT a.u. in the S2013 model compared with K7-750 signal at 5.1 MSOT a.u. (P = 0.0005). There was minimal off-target accumulation of the V7-750 probe within the liver or kidney, and probe distribution was confirmed with ex vivo imaging. Conclusions: Compared with pH-insensitive controls, V7750 pH-sensitive probe specifically targets pancreatic adenocarcinoma and has minimal off-target accumulation. The noninvasive detection of pH-targeted probes by means of MSOT represents a promising modality to improve the detection and monitoring of pancreatic cancer.

J;Optical barcoding of PLGA for multispectral analysis of nanoparticle fate in vivo;Understanding of the mechanisms by which systemically administered nanoparticles achieve delivery across biological barriers remains incomplete, due in part to the challenge of tracking nanoparticle fate in the body. Here, we develop a new approach for barcoding nanoparticles composed of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) with bright, spectrally defined quantum dots (QDs) to enable direct, fluorescent detection of nanoparticle fate with subcellular resolution. We show that QD labeling does not affect major biophysical properties of nanoparticles or their interaction with cells and tissues. Live cell imaging enabled simultaneous visualization of the interaction of control and targeted nanoparticles with bEnd. 3 cells in a flow chamber, providing direct evidence that surface modification of nanoparticles with the cell-penetrating peptide TAT increases their biophysical association with cell surfaces over very short time periods under convective current. We next developed this technique for quantitative biodistribution analysis in vivo. These studies demonstrate that nanoparticle surface modification with the cell penetrating peptide TAT facilitates brain-specific delivery that is restricted to brain vasculature. Although nanoparticle entry into the healthy brain parenchyma is minimal, with no evidence for movement of nanoparticles across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), we observed that nanoparticles are able to enter to the central nervous system (CNS) through regions of altered BBB permeability - for example, into circumventricular organs in the brain or leaky vasculature of late-stage intracranial tumors. In sum, these data demonstrate a new, multispectral approach for barcoding PLGA, which enables simultaneous, quantitative analysis of the fate of multiple nanoparticle formulations in vivo.

J;Machine-Learning Assisted Discrimination of Precancerous and Cancerous from Healthy Oral Tissue Based on Multispectral Autofluorescence Lifetime Imaging Endoscopy;"Complete resection of dysplastic and malignant tissue improves overall survival and delays cancer recurrence in oral cancer patients; however, intraoperative surgical margin assessment is limited to visual inspection and palpation, making it difficult to achieve total resection. There is currently no tool capable of providing real-time, accurate, and continuous margin-assessment guidance during oral cancer resection surgery. Multispectral autofluorescence lifetime imaging (maFLIM) is a label-free imaging modality that enables quantifying a plurality of metabolic and compositional autofluorescence biomarkers of oral dysplasia and cancer. We have developed and validated a machine-learning assisted computer aided detection (CAD) system for automated discrimination of dysplastic and cancerous from healthy oral tissue based on in vivo widefield maFLIM endoscopy data. This CAD system can be potentially embedded into maFLIM endoscopes to enable continuous in situ detection of positive margins during oral cancer resection surgery, thus facilitating maximal tumor resection and improving surgical outcomes for oral cancer patients. Multispectral autofluorescence lifetime imaging (maFLIM) can be used to clinically image a plurality of metabolic and biochemical autofluorescence biomarkers of oral epithelial dysplasia and cancer. This study tested the hypothesis that maFLIM-derived autofluorescence biomarkers can be used in machine-learning (ML) models to discriminate dysplastic and cancerous from healthy oral tissue. Clinical widefield maFLIM endoscopy imaging of cancerous and dysplastic oral lesions was performed at two clinical centers. Endoscopic maFLIM images from 34 patients acquired at one of the clinical centers were used to optimize ML models for automated discrimination of dysplastic and cancerous from healthy oral tissue. A computer-aided detection system was developed and applied to a set of endoscopic maFLIM images from 23 patients acquired at the other clinical center, and its performance was quantified in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). Discrimination of dysplastic and cancerous from healthy oral tissue was achieved with an ROC-AUC of 0.81. This study demonstrates the capabilities of widefield maFLIM endoscopy to clinically image autofluorescence biomarkers that can be used in ML models to discriminate dysplastic and cancerous from healthy oral tissue. Widefield maFLIM endoscopy thus holds potential for automated in situ detection of oral dysplasia and cancer.";2021;10.3390/cancers13194751
J;Depth-Resolved Multispectral Sub-Surface Imaging Using Multifunctional Upconversion Phosphors with Paramagnetic Properties;Molecular imaging is very promising technique used for surgical guidance, which requires advancements related to properties of imaging agents and subsequent data retrieval methods from measured multispectral images. In this article, an upconversion material is introduced for subsurface near-infrared imaging and for the depth recovery of the material embedded below the biological tissue. The results confirm significant correlation between the analytical depth estimate of the material under the tissue and the measured ratio of emitted light from the material at two different wavelengths. Experiments with biological tissue samples demonstrate depth resolved imaging using the rare earth doped multifunctional phosphors. In vitro tests reveal no significant toxicity, whereas the magnetic measurements of the phosphors show that the particles are suitable as magnetic resonance imaging agents. The confocal imaging of fibroblast cells with these phosphors reveals their potential for in vivo imaging. The depth-resolved imaging technique with such phosphors has broad implications for real-time intraoperative surgical guidance.;2015;10.1021/acsami.5b06491
C;Multimode optical imaging of small animals: Development and applications;We present an optical system for small animal imaging that can combine various in vivo imaging modalities, including fluorescence (intensity and lifetime), spectral, and trans-illumination imaging. This system consists of light-tight box with ultrafast pulsed or cw laser light excitation, motorized translational and rotational stages, a telecentric lens for detection, and a cooled CCD camera that can be coupled to an ultrafast time-gated intensifier. All components are modular, making possible laser excitation at various wavelengths and pulse lengths, and signal detection in a variety of ways (multimode). Results of drug nanoconjugate carrier delivery studies in mice are presented. Conventional and spectrally-resolved fluorescence images reveal details of in vivo drug nanoconjugate carrier accumulation within the tumor region and several organs in real time. By multi-spectral image analysis of ex vivo specimens from the same mice, we were able to evaluate the extent and topology of drug nanoconjugate carrier distribution into specific organs and the tumor itself;2007;10.1117/12.711582
J;Enhanced spatial resolution for snapshot hyperspectral imaging of blood perfusion and melanin information within human tissue;We report a reconstruction method to achieve high spatial resolution for hyperspectral imaging of chromophore features in skin in vivo. The method utilizes an established structure-adaptive normalized convolution algorithm to reconstruct high spatial resolution of hyperspectral images from snapshot low-resolution hyperspectral image sequences captured by a snapshot spectral camera. The reconstructed images at chromophore-sensitive wavebands are used to map the skin features of interest. We demonstrate the method experimentally by mapping the blood perfusion and melanin features (moles) on the facial skin. The method relaxes the constrains of the relatively low spatial resolution in the snapshot hyperspectral camera, making it more usable in imaging applications.;2020;10.1002/jbio.202000019
J;Optical oxygen saturation imaging in cellular ex vivo lung perfusion to assess lobular pulmonary function;Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) is an emerging tool to evaluate marginal lungs in lung transplantation. However, there is no objective metric to monitor lobular regional oxygenation during EVLP. In this study, we developed oxygen saturation (SaO(2)) imaging to quantitatively assess the regional gas exchange potential of the lower lobes. Ten porcine lungs were randomly divided into control and donation after circulatory death (DCD) groups (n = 5, each). Lungs were perfused in cellular EVLP for 2 h, and multispectral images were continuously collected from the dorsal sides of the lower lobes. We examined whether lower lobe SaO(2) correlated with PaO2/FiO(2) (P/F) ratios in lower pulmonary veins (PV). The wet/dry ratio in lower lobes was measured and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to investigate the method's feasibility. There was a significant correlation between lower lobe SaO(2) and the P/F ratio in lower PV (r = 0.855, P < 0.001). The DCD group was associated with lower SaO(2) and higher wet/dry ratio than the control group (P < 0.001). The error of estimated SaO(2) was limited according to Monte Carlo simulations. The developed technology provides a noninvasive and regional evaluative tool of quantitative lobular function in EVLP.

J;Multispectral optical imaging device for in vivo detection of oral neoplasia;A multispectral digital microscope (MDM) is designed and constructed as a tool to improve detection of oral neoplasia. The MDM acquires in vivo images of oral tissue in fluorescence, narrow-band (NB) reflectance, and orthogonal polarized reflectance (OPR) modes, to enable evaluation of lesions that may not exhibit high contrast under standard white light illumination. The device rapidly captures image sequences so that the diagnostic value of each modality can be qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated alone and in combination. As part of a pilot clinical trial, images are acquired from normal volunteers and patients with precancerous and cancerous lesions. In normal subjects, the visibility of vasculature can be enhanced by tuning the reflectance illumination wavelength and polarization. In patients with histologically confirmed neoplasia, we observe decreased blue/green autofluorescence and increased red autofluorescence in lesions, and increased visibility of vasculature using NB and OPR imaging. The perceived lesion borders change with imaging modality, suggesting that multimodal imaging has the potential to provide additional diagnostic information not available using standard white light illumination or by using a single imaging mode alone.

J;Optical biopsy of head and neck cancer using hyperspectral imaging and convolutional neural networks;For patients undergoing surgical cancer resection of squamous cell carcinoma (SCCa), cancer-free surgical margins are essential for good prognosis. We developed a method to use hyperspectral imaging (HSI), a noncontact optical imaging modality, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform an optical biopsy of ex-vivo, surgical gross-tissue specimens, collected from 21 patients undergoing surgical cancer resection. Using a cross-validation paradigm with data from different patients, the CNN can distinguish SCCa from normal aerodigestive tract tissues with an area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 0.82. Additionally, normal tissue from the upper aerodigestive tract can be subclassified into squamous epithelium, muscle, and gland with an average AUC of 0.94. After separately training on thyroid tissue, the CNN can differentiate between thyroid carcinoma and normal thyroid with an AUC of 0.95, 92% accuracy, 92% sensitivity, and 92% specificity. Moreover, the CNN can discriminate medullary thyroid carcinoma from benign multinodular goiter (MNG) with an AUC of 0.93. Classical-type papillary thyroid carcinoma is differentiated from MNG with an AUC of 0.91. Our preliminary results demonstrate that an HSI-based optical biopsy method using CNNs can provide multicategory diagnostic information for normal and cancerous head-and-neck tissue, and more patient data are needed to fully investigate the potential and reliability of the proposed technique.

C;Progress in biomedical mid-infrared hyperspectral imaging with fiber-based supercontinuum laser light;A new paradigm in mid-infrared (MIR) biophotonics is opening up. The idea is of portable, MIR hyperspectral imaging in real-time for healthcare, including for in vivo cancer screening and diagnosis, based on new MIR fiber-optics. At the heart of the MIR fiber-optic approach are fiber-based MIR-supercontinuum (SC) broadband laser sources.

J;Theoretical and numerical analysis on multispectral bioluminescence tomography;Recently, molecular imaging has been rapidly developed to study physiological and pathological processes in vivo at the cellular and molecular levels. Among molecular imaging modalities, optical imaging has attracted a major attention for its unique advantages. In this paper, we establish a mathematical framework for multispectral bioluminescence tomography (BLT) that allows simultaneous studies of multiple optical reporters. We show solution existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence on data as well as the limiting behaviours when the regularization parameter approaches zero or when the penalty parameter approaches infinity. Then, we propose two numerical schemes for multispectral BLT and derive error estimates for the corresponding solutions.;2007;10.1093/imamat/hxl031
C;Live Monitoring of Haemodynamic Changes with Multispectral Image Analysis;State-of-the-art concepts in the field of computer assisted medical interventions are typically based on registering pre-operative imaging data to the patient. While this approach has many relevant clinical applications, it suffers from one core bottleneck: it cannot account for tissue dynamics because it works with offline data. To overcome this issue, we propose a new approach to surgical imaging that combines the power of multispectral imaging with the speed and robustness of deep learning based image analysis. Core innovation is an end-to-end deep learning architecture that integrates all preprocessing steps as well as the actual regression task in a single network. According to a quantitative in silico validation, our approach is well-suited for solving the inverse problem of relating multispectral image pixels to underlying functional tissue properties in real time. A porcine study further suggests that our method is capable of monitoring haemodynamic changes in vivo. Deep learning based multispectral imaging could thus become a valuable tool for imaging tissue dynamics.;2019;10.1007/978-3-030-32695-1_5
J;Confocal mosaicing microscopy of human skin ex vivo: spectral analysis for digital staining to simulate histology-like appearance;Confocal mosaicing microscopy enables rapid imaging of large areas of fresh tissue, without the processing that is necessary for conventional histology. Mosaicing may offer a means to perform rapid histology at the bedside. A possible barrier toward clinical acceptance is that the mosaics are based on a single mode of grayscale contrast and appear black and white, whereas histology is based on two stains (hematoxylin for nuclei, eosin for cellular cytoplasm and dermis) and appears purple and pink. Toward addressing this barrier, we report advances in digital staining: fluorescence mosaics that show only nuclei, are digitally stained purple and overlaid on reflectance mosaics, which show only cellular cytoplasm and dermis, and are digitally stained pink. With digital staining, the appearance of confocal mosaics mimics the appearance of histology. Using multispectral analysis and color matching functions, red, green, and blue (RGB) components of hematoxylin and eosin stains in tissue were determined. The resulting RGB components were then applied in a linear algorithm to transform fluorescence and reflectance contrast in confocal mosaics to the absorbance contrast seen in pathology. Optimization of staining with acridine orange showed improved quality of digitally stained mosaics, with good correlation to the corresponding histology.

C;Preliminary results for hyperspectral videoendoscopy diagnostics on the phantoms of normal and abnormal tissues: towards gastrointestinal diagnostics;Cancer is the second most cause of death in the world after cardiovascular related disease. This paper presents the calibration and test results obtained by mean of a hyperspectral reflectance and flexible video endoscope setup. Its application field is intended to be gastrointestinal cancer detection. We fabricated hard tissue phantoms which mimic different types of tissue in terms of its reflection properties for evaluation. The reflectance properties of the phantoms are set by varying the concentration of ink or titanium oxide. The goal is to achieve a similar reflectance properties as in actual respective tissues in vivo. A modified endoscope was used to discriminate the normal and tumor tissue phantoms with reflectance measurements. This hyperspectral endoscope setup consists of a light source, a camera and a camera controller that are compatible for use with conventional video endoscopes and video monitors. This setup allows the operator to switch between conventional white light imaging mode (WLI) and hyperspectral imaging mode (HSI). A significant imaging contrast between normal and tumor tissue phantoms has been provided.;2011;10.1117/12.889829
C;Multispectral imaging of the Olfactory Bulb activation: Influence of realistic differential pathlength correction factors on the derivation of oxygenation and total hemoglobin concentration maps;In vivo multispectral reflectance imaging has been extensively used in the somatosensory cortex (SsC) in anesthetized rodents to collect intrinsic signal during activation and derive hemodynamics signals time courses. So far it has never been applied to the Olfactory Bulb (OB), although this structure is particularly well suited to the optical study of brain activation due to the its well defined organization, the ability to physiologically activate it with odorants, and the low depth of the activated layers. To obtain hemodynamics parameters from reflectance variations data, it is necessary to take into account a corrective factor called Differential Pathlength (DP). It is routinely estimated using Monte Carlo simulations, modeling photons propagation in simplified infinite geometry tissue models. The first goal of our study was to evaluate the influence of more realistic layered geometries and optical properties on the calculation of DP and ultimately on the estimation of the hemodynamics parameters. Since many valuable results have been obtained previously by others in the SSc, for the purpose of validation and comparison we performed Monte Carlo simulations in both the SSC and the OB. We verified the assumption of constant DP during activation by varying the hemoglobin oxygen saturation, total hemoglobin concentration and we also studied the effect of a superficial bone layer on DP estimation for OB. The simulations show the importance of defining a finite multilayer model instead of the coarse infinite monolayer model, especially for the SSc, and demonstrate the need to perform DP calculation for each structure taking into account their anatomofunctional properties. The second goal of the study was to validate in vivo multispectral imaging for the study of hemodynamics in the OB during activation. First results are presented and discussed.;2011;10.1117/12.874837
J;Hyperspectral Imaging as a Tool for Viability Assessment During Normothermic Machine Perfusion of Human Livers: A Proof of Concept Pilot Study;Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) allows for ex vivo viability and functional assessment prior to liver transplantation (LT). Hyperspectral imaging represents a suitable, non-invasive method to evaluate tissue morphology and organ perfusion during NMP. Liver allografts were subjected to NMP prior to LT. Serial image acquisition of oxygen saturation levels (StO2), organ hemoglobin (THI), near-infrared perfusion (NIR) and tissue water indices (TWI) through hyperspectral imaging was performed during static cold storage, at 1h, 6h, 12h and at the end of NMP. The readouts were correlated with perfusate parameters at equivalent time points. Twenty-one deceased donor livers were included in the study. Seven (33.0%) were discarded due to poor organ function during NMP. StO2 (p < 0.001), THI (p < 0.001) and NIR (p = 0.002) significantly augmented, from static cold storage (pre-NMP) to NMP end, while TWI dropped (p = 0.005) during the observational period. At 12-24h, a significantly higher hemoglobin concentration (THI) in the superficial tissue layers was seen in discarded, compared to transplanted livers (p = 0.036). Lactate values at 12h NMP correlated negatively with NIR perfusion index between 12 and 24h NMP and with the delta NIR perfusion index between 1 and 24h (rs = -0.883, p = 0.008 for both). Furthermore, NIR and TWI correlated with lactate clearance and pH. This study provides first evidence of feasibility of hyperspectral imaging as a potentially helpful contact-free organ viability assessment tool during liver NMP.;2022;10.3389/ti.2022.10355
J;In vivo sensing of cutaneous edema: A comparative study of diffuse reflectance, Raman spectroscopy and multispectral imaging;"Quantitative noninvasive assessment of water content in tissues is important for biomedicine. Optical spectroscopy is potentially capable of solving this problem; however, its applicability for clinical diagnostics remains questionable. The presented study compares diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and multispectral imaging in the characterization of cutaneous edema. The source-detector geometries for each method are selected based on Monte Carlo simulations results to detect the signal from the dermis. Then, the kinetics of the edema development is studied for two models. All methods demonstrate synchronous trends for histamine-induced edema: The water content reaches a maximum of 1 hour after histamine application and then gradually decreases. For the venous occlusion, a 51% increase in water content is observed with Raman spectroscopy. The differences in water content estimation by three methods are explained based on the light propagation model. The obtained results are essential for introducing quantitative optical water measurement technology to the clinics.";2022;10.1002/jbio.202100268
J;A customized multispectral needle probe combined with a virtual photometric setup for in vivo detection of Lewis lung carcinoma in an animal model;Optical systems applied for tissue analysis are primarily based on single spectroscopic techniques. This paper however presents a multispectral backscattering sensor designed for in vivo application by a specially formed probe tip which allows side by side monitoring of ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared and fluorescence spectra. The practical applicability of the measurement system was demonstrated in vitro (muscle and adipose tissue) and in vivo in an animal model (mouse). By comparing associated measuring changes in biochemical, physical-morphological and colorimetric values this procedure allows a differentiation between healthy, marginal and malignant tissue.;2019;10.1088/1361-6501/ab24a1
J;Tumor Accumulation of NIR Fluorescent PEG PLA Nanoparticles: Impact of Particle Size and Human Xenograft Tumor Model;Cancer therapies are often terminated due to serious side effects of the drugs. The cause is the nonspecific distribution of chemotherapeutic agents to both cancerous and normal cells. Therefore, drug carriers which deliver their toxic cargo specific to cancer cells are needed. Size is one key parameter for the nanoparticle accumulation In tumor tissues. In the present study the influence of the size of biodegradable nanoparticles was investigated in detail, combining in vivo and ex vivo analysis with comprehensive particle size characterizations. Polyethylene glycol polyesters poly(lactide) block polymers were synthesized and used for the production of three defined, stable, and nontoxic near-infrared (NIR) dye-loaded nanoparticle batches. Size analysis based on asymmetrical field flow field fractionation coupled with multiangle laser light scattering and photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) revealed narrow size distribution and permitted accurate size evaluations. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the constraints of particle size data only obtained by PCS. By the multispectral analysis of the Maestro in vivo imaging system the in vivo fate of the nanoparticles next to their accumulation in special red fluorescent DsRed2 expressing HT29 xenografts could be followed. This simultaneous imaging in addition to confocal microscopy studies revealed information about the accumulation characteristics of nanoparticles inside the tumor tissues. This knowledge was further combined with extended size-dependent fluorescence imaging studies at two different xenograft tumor types, the HT29 (colorectal carcinoma) and the A2780 (ovarian carcinoma) cell lines. The combination of two different size measurement methods allowed the characterization of the dependence of nanoparticle accumulation in the tumor on even rather small differences in the. nanoparticle size. While two nanoparticle batches (111 and 141 nm in diameter) accumulated efficiently in the human xenograft tumor tissue, the slightly bigger nanoparticles (diameter 166 nm) were rapidly eliminated by the liver.;2011;10.1021/nn2026353
C;Methods and means of measuring control and diagnostics of biological tissues in vivo based on measurements of color coordinates and multispectral image;The method and a diagnostic tool based on a digital colorimetry and multispectral images of biological tissues are improved and developed. The method consists of measuring the color coordinates in the biological tissue, or XYZ coordinates in n-dimensional multispectral space in a diffuse light from the standard light source. Keywords: digital colorimetry, heterogeneous biological environment, spectral characteristics, biological tissue, color coordinates.;2015;10.1117/12.2229034
C;Dual-mode quantitative imaging of wound tissue oxygenation and perfusion;Accurate assessment of wound oxygenation and perfusion is important for evaluating wound healing/regression and guiding following therapeutic processes. However, many existing techniques and clinical practices are subjective and qualitative due to background bias, tissue heterogeneity, and inter-patient variation. To overcome these limitations, we developed a dual-modal imaging system for in vivo, non-invasive, real-time quantitative assessment of wound tissue oxygenation and perfusion. The imaging system integrated a broadband light source, a high-resolution CCD camera, a highly sensitive thermal camera, and a liquid crystal tunable filter. A user-friendly interface was developed to control all the components systematically. Advanced algorithms were explored for reliable reconstruction of tissue oxygenation and appropriate co-registration between thermal images and multispectral images. Dual-mode oxygenation and perfusion imaging was demonstrated on both benchtop models and human subjects, and compared with measurements using other methods, such as Laser Doppler and tissue oximeter. The test results suggested that the dual-modal imaging system has the potential for non-contact real-time imaging of wound tissue oxygenation and perfusion.;2010;10.1117/12.842010
J;Noninvasive Imaging of Colitis Using Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography;Currently, several noninvasive modalities, including MRI and PET, are being investigated to identify early intestinal inflammation, longitudinally monitor disease status, or detect dysplastic changes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Here, we assess the applicability and utility of multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) in evaluating the presence and severity of colitis. Methods: C57B/6 mice were untreated or treated with Bacteroides fragilis and antibiotic- mediated depletion of intestinal flora to initiate colitis. Mice were imaged using MSOT to detect intestinal inflammation. Intestinal inflammation identified with MSOT was also confirmed using both colonoscopy and histology. Results: Mice with bacterial colitis demonstrated a temporally associated increase in mesenteric and colonic vascularity with an increase in mean signal intensity of oxygenated hemoglobin (P = 0.004) by MSOT 2 d after inoculation. These findings were significantly more prominent 7 d after inoculation, with increased mean signal intensity of oxygenated hemoglobin (P = 0.0002) and the development of punctate vascular lesions on the colonic surface, which corresponded to changes observed on colonoscopy as well as histology. Conclusion: With improvements in depth of tissue penetration, MSOT may hold potential as a sensitive, accurate, noninvasive imaging tool in the evaluation of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.;2017;10.2967/jnumed.116.184705
J;Hyperspectral imaging solutions for brain tissue metabolic and hemodynamic monitoring: past, current and future developments;"Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technologies have been used extensively in medical research, targeting various biological phenomena and multiple tissue types. Their high spectral resolution over a wide range of wavelengths enables acquisition of spatial information corresponding to different light-interacting biological compounds. This review focuses on the application of HSI to monitor brain tissue metabolism and hemodynamics in life sciences. Different approaches involving HSI have been investigated to assess and quantify cerebral activity, mainly focusing on: (1) mapping tissue oxygen delivery through measurement of changes in oxygenated (HbO(2)) and deoxygenated (HHb) hemoglobin; and (2) the assessment of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) to estimate oxygen consumption by brain tissue. Finally, we introduce future perspectives of HSI of brain metabolism, including its potential use for imaging optical signals from molecules directly involved in cellular energy production. HSI solutions can provide remarkable insight in understanding cerebral tissue metabolism and oxygenation, aiding investigation on brain tissue physiological processes.";2018;10.1088/2040-8986/aab3a6
J;Statistical Molecular Target Detection Framework for Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography;Statistical sub-pixel detection via the adaptive matched filter (AMF) has been shown to improve the molecular imaging sensitivity and specificity of optoacoustic (photoacoustic) imaging. Applied to multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), AMF assumes that the spatially-varying tissue spectra follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution, that the spectrum of the target molecule is precisely known and that the molecular target lies in low probability within the data. However, when these assumptions are violated, AMF may result in considerable performance degradation. The objective of this work is to develop a robust statistical detection framework that is appropriately suited to the characteristics of MSOT molecular imaging. Using experimental imaging data, we perform a statistical characterization of MSOT tissue images and conclude to a detector that is based on the t-distribution. More importantly, we introduce a method for estimating the covariance matrix of the background-tissue statistical distribution, which enables robust detection performance independently of the molecular target size or intensity. The performance of the statistical detection framework is assessed through simulations and experimental in vivo measurements and compared to previously used methods.;2016;10.1109/TMI.2016.2583791
C;Time-resolved multiphoton imaging of basal cell carcinoma;We investigated human cutaneous basal cell carcinoma ex-vivo samples by combined time resolved two photon intrinsic fluorescence and second harmonic generation microscopy. Morphological and spectroscopic differences were found between malignant skin and corresponding healthy skin tissues. In comparison with normal healthy skin, cancer tissue showed a different morphology and a mean fluorescence lifetime distribution slightly shifted towards higher values. Topical application of delta-aminolevulinic acid to the lesion four hours before excision resulted in an enhancement of the fluorescence signal arising from malignant tissue, due to the accumulation of protoporphyrines inside tumor cells. Contrast enhancement was prevalent at tumor borders by both two photon fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging. Fluorescence-based images showed a good correlation with conventional histopathological analysis, thereby supporting the diagnostic accuracy of this novel method. Combined morphological and lifetime analysis in the study of ex-vivo skin samples discriminated benign from malignant tissues, thus offering a reliable, non-invasive tool for the in-vivo analysis of inflammatory and neoplastic skin lesions.;2007;10.1117/12.700216
J;Estimation of tissue oxygen saturation from RGB images and sparse hyperspectral signals based on conditional generative adversarial network;PurposeIntra-operative measurement of tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) is important in detection of ischaemia, monitoring perfusion and identifying disease. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) measures the optical reflectance spectrum of the tissue and uses this information to quantify its composition, including StO2. However, real-time monitoring is difficult due to capture rate and data processing time.MethodsAn endoscopic system based on a multi-fibre probe was previously developed to sparsely capture HSI data (sHSI). These were combined with RGB images, via a deep neural network, to generate high-resolution hypercubes and calculate StO2. To improve accuracy and processing speed, we propose a dual-input conditional generative adversarial network, Dual2StO2, to directly estimate StO2 by fusing features from both RGB and sHSI.ResultsValidation experiments were carried out on in vivo porcine bowel data, where the ground truth StO2 was generated from the HSI camera. Performance was also compared to our previous super-spectral-resolution network, SSRNet in terms of mean StO2 prediction accuracy and structural similarity metrics. Dual2StO2 was also tested using simulated probe data with varying fibre number.ConclusionsStO2 estimation by Dual2StO2 is visually closer to ground truth in general structure and achieves higher prediction accuracy and faster processing speed than SSRNet. Simulations showed that results improved when a greater number of fibres are used in the probe. Future work will include refinement of the network architecture, hardware optimization based on simulation results, and evaluation of the technique in clinical applications beyond StO2 estimation.;2019;10.1007/s11548-019-01940-2
J;Deep tissue imaging using spectroscopic analysis of multiply scattered light;Scattering limits the penetration depth of most optical imaging techniques. Efforts to overcome this limitation often require complex optical or computational schemes. We have developed a new method of assessing tissue properties based on spectroscopic analysis of multiply scattered light. The technique, multispectral multiple-scattering low-coherence interferometry (ms2/LCI), uses coherence and spatial gating to produce images of tissue optical properties up to 9 mm deep, with millimeter-scale resolution. The capabilities of ms2/LCI are demonstrated using tissue phantoms composed of chicken breast. Discrimination of diseased and healthy tissues is shown through imaging and analysis of burns in ex vivo human skin samples. Our technique may provide a powerful way to assess burn depth and progression in sensitive, burned tissues where physical contact is undesirable.

J;Noninvasive detection of acute cerebral hypoxia and subsequent matrix-metalloproteinase activity in a mouse model of cerebral ischemia using multispectral-optoacoustic-tomography;Oxygen metabolism and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play important roles in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia. Using multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging, we visualized in vivo changes in cerebral tissue oxygenation during 1 h of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and at 48 h after reperfusion together with MMP activity using an MMP-activatable probe. The deoxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, and MMP signals were coregistered with structural magnetic resonance imaging data. The ipsi-/contralateral ratio of tissue oxygen saturation (SO2) was significantly reduced during 1 h of tMCAO and recovered after 48 h of reperfusion in tMCAO compared with sham-operated mice (n = 8 to 10 per group). A higher ipsi-/contralateral MMP signal ratio was detected at 48 h after reperfusion in the lesioned brain regions of tMCAO compared with the sham-operated animal (n = 4 to 6 per group). Ex vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging of MMP signal in brain slices was used to validate in vivo MSOT measurements. In conclusion, non-invasive MSOT imaging can provide visualization of hemodynamic alterations and MMP activity in a mouse model of cerebral ischemia. (c) The Authors.;2018;10.1117/1.NPh.5.1.015005
J;Multispectral reflectance imaging of brain activation in rodents: methodological study of the differential path length estimations and first in vivo recordings in the rat olfactory bulb;Dynamic maps of relative changes in blood volume and oxygenation following brain activation are obtained using multispectral reflectance imaging. The technique relies on optical absorption modifications linked to hemodynamic changes. The relative variation of hemodynamic parameters can be quantified using the modified Beer-Lambert Law if changes in reflected light intensities are recorded at two wavelengths or more and the differential path length (DP) is known. The DP is the mean path length in tissues of backscattered photons and varies with wavelength. It is usually estimated using Monte Carlo simulations in simplified semi-infinite homogeneous geometries. Here we consider the use of multi layered models of the somatosensory cortex (SsC) and olfactory bulb (OB), which are common physiological models of brain activation. Simulations demonstrate that specific DP estimation is required for SsC and OB, specifically for wavelengths above 600 nm. They validate the hypothesis of a constant path length during activation and show the need for specific DP if imaging is performed in a thinned-skull preparation. The first multispectral reflectance imaging data recorded in vivo during OB activation are presented, and the influence of DP on the hemodynamic parameters and the pattern of oxymetric changes in the activated OB are discussed.

J;Multiscale, multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging using a double-clad fiber;Fiber-based imaging of tissue autofluorescence using ultraviolet (UV) excitation is a highly flexible tool used to probe structure and composition. In this Letter, we report, to the best of our knowledge, the first results from a single-fiber imaging system employing a custom double-clad fiber to acquire multispectral fluorescence lifetime images at two distinct spatial resolutions. We characterize the lateral point spread function and fluorescent background of the system and show how enhanced resolution can identify features such as trabeculae in ex vivo murine bone samples.

J;Confocal-Assisted Multispectral Fluorescent Microscopy for Brain Tumor Surgery;Optimal surgical therapy for brain tumors is the combination of complete resection with minimal invasion and damage to the adjacent normal tissue. To achieve this goal, we need advanced imaging techniques on a scale from macro-to microscopic resolution. In the last decade, the development of fluorescence-guided surgery has been the most influential breakthrough, marginally improving outcomes in brain tumor surgery. Multispectral fluorescence microscopy (MFL) is a novel imaging technique that allows the overlapping of a fluorescent image and a white light image in real-time, with delivery of the merged image to the surgeon through the eyepieces of a surgical microscope. MFL permits the detection and characterization of brain tumors using fluorescent molecular markers such as 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) or indocyanine green (ICG), while simultaneously obtaining high definition white light images to create a pseudo-colored composite image in real-time. Limitations associated with the use of MFL include decreased light imaging intensity and decreased levels of magnification that may compromise maximal tumor resection on a cellular scale. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is another novel advanced imaging technique that is based on miniaturization of the microscope imaging head in order to provide the possibility of in vivo microscopy at the cellular level. Clear visualization of the cellular cytoarchitecture can be achieved with 400-fold-1,000-fold magnification. CLE allows on the one hand the intra-operative detection and differentiation of single tumor cells (without the need for intra-operative histologic analysis of biopsy specimens) as well as the definition of borders between tumor and normal tissue at a cellular level, dramatically improving the accuracy of surgical resection. The application and implementation of CLE-assisted surgery in surgical oncology increases not only the number of options for real-time diagnostic imaging, but also the therapeutic options by extending the resection borders of cancer at a cellular level and, more importantly, by protecting the functionality of normal tissue in the adjacent areas of the human brain. In this article, we describe our experience using these new techniques of confocal-assisted fluorescent surgery including analysis on the technology, usability, indications, limitations, and further developments.;2019;10.3389/fonc.2019.00583
J;Spatio-spectral classification of hyperspectral images for brain cancer detection during surgical operations;Surgery for brain cancer is a major problem in neurosurgery. The diffuse infiltration into the surrounding normal brain by these tumors makes their accurate identification by the naked eye difficult. Since surgery is the common treatment for brain cancer, an accurate radical resection of the tumor leads to improved survival rates for patients. However, the identification of the tumor boundaries during surgery is challenging. Hyperspectral imaging is a noncontact, non-ionizing and non-invasive technique suitable for medical diagnosis. This study presents the development of a novel classification method taking into account the spatial and spectral characteristics of the hyperspectral images to help neurosurgeons to accurately determine the tumor boundaries in surgical-time during the resection, avoiding excessive excision of normal tissue or unintentionally leaving residual tumor. The algorithm proposed in this study to approach an efficient solution consists of a hybrid framework that combines both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. Firstly, a supervised pixel-wise classification using a Support Vector Machine classifier is performed. The generated classification map is spatially homogenized using a one-band representation of the HS cube, employing the Fixed Reference t-Stochastic Neighbors Embedding dimensional reduction algorithm, and performing a K-Nearest Neighbors filtering. The information generated by the supervised stage is combined with a segmentation map obtained via unsupervised clustering employing a Hierarchical K-Means algorithm. The fusion is performed using a majority voting approach that associates each cluster with a certain class. To evaluate the proposed approach, five hyperspectral images of surface of the brain affected by glioblastoma tumor in vivo from five different patients have been used. The final classification maps obtained have been analyzed and validated by specialists. These preliminary results are promising, obtaining an accurate delineation of the tumor area.;2018;10.1371/journal.pone.0193721
J;Hyperspectral imaging of tissue perfusion and oxygenation in wounds: assessing the impact of a micro capillary dressing;Objective: Experimental tests of non-invasive multi-or hyperspectral imaging (HSI) systems reveal the high potential of support for medical diagnostic purposes and scientific biomedical analysis. Until now the use of HSI technologies for medical applications was limited by complex and overly sophisticated systems. We present a new and compact HSI-camera that could be used in normal clinical practice. Method: We assessed the use of the HSI system on the hands of 10 healthy volunteers, looking at control parameters, and those following venous occlusion, arterial occlusion and reperfusion, including tissue oxygenation, tissue haemoglobin index, perfusion in 4-6mm depth=near infrared spectroscopy (NIR), and tissue water index. Pseudo colours used ranged from 0% (blue) to 100% (red). We also assessed differences in the wounds of three patients. Results: The results show good potential in all parameters in the healthy volunteers, which had high conformity with validated reference oximetry measurements. In three wounds, different levels of oxygenation were identified in the wound area, although interpretation of these results is complex. In Cases 2 and 3, following the application of a micro capillary dressing, improvements were seen in perfusion and reduction of the tissue water index (TWI). Conclusion: The camera system proved to be quick, flexible and yielded data with high spatial and spectral resolution. These data will be used to perform a power analysis for a randomised controlled study. Declaration of interest: The authors have is no conflict of interest.;2018;10.12968/jowc.2018.27.1.38
J;Parallel K-Means Clustering for Brain Cancer Detection Using Hyperspectral Images;The precise delineation of brain cancer is a crucial task during surgery. There are several techniques employed during surgical procedures to guide neurosurgeons in the tumor resection. However, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a promising non-invasive and non-ionizing imaging technique that could improve and complement the currently used methods. The HypErspectraL Imaging Cancer Detection (HELICoiD) European project has addressed the development of a methodology for tumor tissue detection and delineation exploiting HSI techniques. In this approach, the K-means algorithm emerged in the delimitation of tumor borders, which is of crucial importance. The main drawback is the computational complexity of this algorithm. This paper describes the development of the K-means clustering algorithm on different parallel architectures, in order to provide real-time processing during surgical procedures. This algorithm will generate an unsupervised segmentation map that, combined with a supervised classification map, will offer guidance to the neurosurgeon during the tumor resection task. We present parallel K-means clustering based on OpenMP, CUDA and OpenCL paradigms. These algorithms have been validated through an in-vivo hyperspectral human brain image database. Experimental results show that the CUDA version can achieve a speed-up of with respect to a sequential processing. The remarkable result obtained in this paper makes possible the development of a real-time classification system.;2018;10.3390/electronics7110283
C;Optical design of an optical coherence tomography and multispectral fluorescence imaging endoscope to detect early stage ovarian cancer;The five year survival rate for ovarian cancer is over 90% if early detection occurs, yet no effective early screening method exists. We have designed and are constructing a dual modality Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Multispectral Fluorescence Imaging (MFI) endoscope to optically screen the Fallopian tube and ovary for early stage cancer. The endoscope reaches the ovary via the natural pathway of the vagina, cervix, uterus and Fallopian tube. In order to navigate the Fallopian tube the endoscope must have an outer diameter of 600 lam, be highly flexible, steerable, tracking and non-perforating. The imaging systems consists of six optical subsystems, two from OCT and four from MFI. The optical subsystems have independent and interrelated design criteria. The endoscope will be tested on realistic tissue models and ex vivo tissue to prove feasibility of future human trials. Ultimately the project aims to provide women the first effective ovarian cancer screening technique.;2014;10.1117/12.2073824
J;3D wide-field multispectral photoacoustic imaging of human melanomas in vivo: a pilot study;Background The Breslow depth is an important parameter to determine the excision margin and prognosis of melanoma. However, it is difficult to accurately determine the actual Breslow depth before surgery using the existing ocular micrometer and biopsy technique. Objectives To evaluate the use of 3D wide-field multispectral photoacoustic imaging to non-invasively measure depth and outline the boundary of melanomas for optimal surgical margin selection. Methods Six melanoma patients were examined in vivo using the 3D multispectral photoacoustic imaging system. For five cases of melanomas (one in situ, three nodular, and one acral lentiginous type melanoma), the spectrally unmixed photoacoustic depths were calculated and compared against histopathological depths. Results Spectrally unmixed photoacoustic depths and histopathological depths match well within a mean absolute error of 0.36 mm. In particular, the measured minimum and maximum depths in the in situ and nodular type of melanoma were 0.6 and 9.1 mm, respectively. In the 3D photoacoustic image of one metastatic melanoma, feeding vessels were visualized in the melanoma, suggesting the neovascularization around the tumour. Conclusions The 3D multispectral photoacoustic imaging not only provides well-measured depth and sizes of various types of melanomas, it also visualizes the metastatic type of melanoma. Obtaining accurate depth and boundary information of melanoma before surgery would play a useful role in the complete excision of melanoma during surgery.;2021;10.1111/jdv.16985
J;Handheld macroscopic Raman spectroscopy imaging instrument for machine-learning-based molecular tissue margins characterization;Significance: Raman spectroscopy has been developed for surgical guidance applications interrogating live tissue during tumor resection procedures to detect molecular contrast consistent with cancer pathophysiological changes. To date, the vibrational spectroscopy systems developed for medical applications include single-point measurement probes and intraoperative microscopes. There is a need to develop systems with larger fields of view (FOVs) for rapid intraoperative cancer margin detection during surgery. Aim: We design a handheld macroscopic Raman imaging system for in vivo tissue margin characterization and test its performance in a model system. Approach: The system is made of a sterilizable line scanner employing a coherent fiber bundle for relaying excitation light from a 785-nm laser to the tissue. A second coherent fiber bundle is used for hyperspectral detection of the fingerprint Raman signal over an area of 1 cm(2). Machine learning classifiers were trained and validated on porcine adipose and muscle tissue. Results: Porcine adipose versus muscle margin detection was validated ex vivo with an accuracy of 99% over the FOV of 95 mm(2) in similar to 3 min using a support vector machine. Conclusions: This system is the first large FOV Raman imaging system designed to be integrated in the workflow of surgical cancer resection. It will be further improved with the aim of discriminating brain cancer in a clinically acceptable timeframe during glioma surgery. (C) The Authors.

C;Combined Functional Data from Multispectral Non-Ionizing and Non-Invasive Brain Imaging;Ongoing research during the past few years, envisions the development of an integrated functional imaging methodology to study brain function in-vivo and ex-vivo through a multi-modal, multi-spectral approach using non-ionizing radiation to provide combined functional information from molecule to tissue level. The scope of this research is threefold: a) provide non-invasive, non-ionizing functional imaging comprising combined blood flow and neural dynamics information, as well as passive measurement of temperature and conductivity fluctuations during activation of specified brain areas in-vivo and b) identify new brain biomarkers related to brain functionality both in health and disease through Terahertz biomolecule imaging ex-vivo. To achieve the abovementioned the stages of our research comprise: 1) exploration of the functional imaging potential of a novel passive microwave imaging device, 2) development of integrated functional imaging systems for concurrent measurements of blood flow, neural activity, temperature and conductivity changes in the brain, 3) definition of biomolecular markers related to brain functionality and disease ex-vivo. The accumulation of a wealth of brain functional data from molecular to system level will lead to a broad range of applications, spanning the delineation of brain networks, improved post-processing of the obtained measurements, understanding the basis of neuropsychiatric diseases and effective treatment design.;2009;
J;Multimodal imaging of cutaneous wound tissue;Quantitative assessment of wound tissue ischemia, perfusion, and inflammation provides critical information for appropriate detection, staging, and treatment of chronic wounds. However, few methods are available for simultaneous assessment of these tissue parameters in a noninvasive and quantitative fashion. We integrated hyperspectral, laser speckle, and thermographic imaging modalities in a single-experimental setup for multimodal assessment of tissue oxygenation, perfusion, and inflammation characteristics. Algorithms were developed for appropriate coregistration between wound images acquired by different imaging modalities at different times. The multimodal wound imaging system was validated in an occlusion experiment, where oxygenation and perfusion maps of a healthy subject's upper extremity were continuously monitored during a postocclusive reactive hyperemia procedure and compared with standard measurements. The system was also tested in a clinical trial where a wound of three millimeters in diameter was introduced on a healthy subject's lower extremity and the healing process was continuously monitored. Our in vivo experiments demonstrated the clinical feasibility of multimodal cutaneous wound imaging. (C) 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE);2015;10.1117/1.JBO.20.1.016016
J;Dynamic dual-tracer MRI-guided fluorescence tomography to quantify receptor density in vivo;"The up-regulation of cell surface receptors has become a central focus in personalized cancer treatment; however, because of the complex nature of contrast agent pharmacokinetics in tumor tissue, methods to quantify receptor binding in vivo remain elusive. Here, we present a dual-tracer optical technique for noninvasive estimation of specific receptor binding in cancer. A multispectral MRI-coupled fluorescence molecular tomography system was used to image the uptake kinetics of two fluorescent tracers injected simultaneously, one tracer targeted to the receptor of interest and the other tracer a nontargeted reference. These dynamic tracer data were then fit to a dual-tracer compartmental model to estimate the density of receptors available for binding in the tissue. Applying this approach to mice with deep-seated gliomas that overexpress the EGF receptor produced an estimate of available receptor density of 2.3 +/- 0.5 nM (n = 5), consistent with values estimated in comparative invasive imaging and ex vivo studies.";2013;10.1073/pnas.1213490110
J;Multispectral Cerenkov luminescence tomography for small animal optical imaging;Quite recently Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) has been introduced as a novel pre-clinical imaging for the in vivo imaging of small animals such as mice. The CLI method is based on the detection of Cerenkov radiation (CR) generated by beta particles as they travel into the animal tissues with an energy such that Cerenkov emission condition is satisfied. This paper describes an image reconstruction method called multi spectral diffuse Cerenkov luminescence tomography (msCLT) in order to obtain 3D images from the detection of CR. The multispectral approach is based on a set of 2D planar images acquired using a number of narrow bandpass filters, and the distinctive information content at each wavelength is used in the 3D image reconstruction process. The proposed msCLT method was tested both in vitro and in vivo using P-32-ATP and all the images were acquired by using the IVIS 200 small animal optical imager (Caliper Life Sciences, Alameda USA). Source depth estimation and spatial resolution measurements were performed using a small capillary source placed between several slices of chicken breast. The theoretical Cerenkov emission spectrum and optical properties of chicken breast were used in the modelling of photon propagation. In vivo imaging was performed by injecting control nude mice with 10 MBq of P-32-ATP and the 3D tracer bio-distribution was reconstructed. Whole body MRI was acquired to provide an anatomical localization of the Cerenkov emission. The spatial resolution obtained from the msCLT reconstructed images of the capillary source showed that the FWHM is about 1.5 mm for a 6 mm depth. Co-registered MRI images showed that the Cerenkov emission regions matches fairly well with anatomical regions, such as the brain, heart and abdomen. Ex vivo imaging of the different organs such as intestine, brain, heart and ribs further confirms these findings. We conclude that in vivo 3D bio-distribution of a pure beta-minus emitting radiopharmaceutical such as P-32-ATP can be obtained using the msCLT reconstruction approach.

J;Automatic Liver Viability Scoring with Deep Learning and Hyperspectral Imaging;Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a non-invasive imaging modality already applied to evaluate hepatic oxygenation and to discriminate different models of hepatic ischemia. Nevertheless, the ability of HSI to detect and predict the reperfusion damage intraoperatively was not yet assessed. Hypoxia caused by hepatic artery occlusion (HAO) in the liver brings about dreadful vascular complications known as ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Here, we show the evaluation of liver viability in an HAO model with an artificial intelligence-based analysis of HSI. We have combined the potential of HSI to extract quantitative optical tissue properties with a deep learning-based model using convolutional neural networks. The artificial intelligence (AI) score of liver viability showed a significant correlation with capillary lactate from the liver surface (r = -0.78, p = 0.0320) and Suzuki's score (r = -0.96, p = 0.0012). CD31 immunostaining confirmed the microvascular damage accordingly with the AI score. Our results ultimately show the potential of an HSI-AI-based analysis to predict liver viability, thereby prompting for intraoperative tool development to explore its application in a clinical setting.;2021;10.3390/diagnostics11091527
J;Principal component model of multispectral data for near real-time skin chromophore mapping;Multispectral images of skin contain information on the spatial distribution of biological chromophores, such as blood and melanin. From this, parameters such as blood volume and blood oxygenation can be retrieved using reconstruction algorithms. Most such approaches use some form of pixelwise or volumetric reconstruction code. We explore the use of principal component analysis (PCA) of multispectral images to access blood volume and blood oxygenation in near real time. We present data from healthy volunteers under arterial occlusion of the forearm, experiencing ischemia and reactive hyperemia. Using a two-layered analytical skin model, we show reconstruction results of blood volume and oxygenation and compare it to the results obtained from our new spectral analysis based on PCA. We demonstrate that PCA applied to multispectral images gives near equivalent results for skin chromophore mapping and quantification with the advantage of being three orders of magnitude faster than the reconstruction algorithm.

J;Active DLP Hyperspectral Illumination: A Noninvasive, in Vivo, System Characterization Visualizing Tissue Oxygenation at Near Video Rates;We report use of a novel hyperspectral imaging system utilizing digital light processing (DLP) technology to noninvasively visualize in vivo tissue oxygenation during surgical procedures. The system's novelty resides in its method of illuminating tissue with precisely predetermined continuous complex spectra. The Texas Instruments digital micromirror device, DMD, chip consisting of 768 by 1024 mirrors, each 16 mu m square, can be switched between two positions at 12.5 kHz. Switching the appropriate mirrors controls the intensity of light illuminating the tissue as a function of wavelength, active spectral illumination. Meaning, the tissue can be illuminated with a different spectrum of light within 80 mu s. Precisely, predetermined spectral illumination penetrates into patient tissue, its chemical composition augments the spectral properties of the light, and its reflected spectra are detected and digitized at each pixel detector of a silicon charge-coupled device, CCD. Using complex spectral illumination, digital signal processing and chemometric methods produce chemically relevant images at near video rates. Specific to this work, tissue is illuminated spectrally with light spanning the visible electromagnetic spectrum (380 to 780 nm). Spectrophotometric images are detected and processed visualizing the percentage of oxyhemoglobin at each pixel detector and presented continuously, in real time, at 3 images per second. As a proof of principle application, kidneys of four live anesthetized pigs were imaged before, during, and after renal vascular occlusion. DLP Hyperspectral Imaging with active spectral illumination detected a 64.73 +/- 1.5% drop in the oxygenation of hemoglobin within 30 s of renal arterial occlusion. Producing chemically encoded images at near video rate, time-resolved hyperspectral imaging facilitates monitoring renal blood flow during animal surgery and holds considerable promise for doing the same during human surgical interventions.;2011;10.1021/ac201467v
J;Multispectral Mueller polarimetric imaging detecting residual cancer and cancer regression after neoadjuvant treatment for colorectal carcinomas;This work is devoted to a first exploration of Mueller polarimetric imaging for the detection of residual cancer after neoadjuvant treatment for the rectum. Three samples of colorectal carcinomas treated by radiochemotherapy together with one untreated sample are analyzed ex vivo before fixation in formalin by using a multispectral Mueller polarimetric imaging system operated from 500 to 700 nm. The Mueller images, analyzed using the Lu-Chipmann decomposition, show negligible diattenuation and retardation. The nonirradiated rectum exhibits a variation of depolarization with cancer evolution stage. At all wavelengths on irradiated samples, the contrast between the footprint of the initial tumor and surrounding healthy tissue is found to be much smaller for complete tumor regression than when a residual tumor is present, even at volume fractions of the order of 5%. This high sensitivity is attributed to the modification of stromal collagen induced by the cancer. The depolarization contrast between treated cancer and healthy tissue is found to increase monotonously with the volume fraction of residual cancer in the red part of the spectrum. Polarimetric imaging is a promising technique for detecting short-time small residual cancers, which is valuable information for pathological diagnosis and patient management by clinicians.

J;Multispectral photoacoustic imaging for the detection of subclinical melanoma;Background Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a noninvasive technique for melanin detection within melanoma metastases. While ex vivo and early studies suggest promising clinical application, there are no standardized parameters for defining presence of melanoma metastases. Methods Following flank/hindlimb melanoma induction in BRaf-PTEN transgenic mice, bilateral inguinal lymph nodes (LN) were imaged in vivo at 4 to 8 weeks using PAI. Fourteen diagnostic parameters for in vivo detection of LN metastases were compared using the receiver operating characteristic and area-under-the-curve (AUC). Limits of detectability were assessed in ex vivo and in vitro phantom studies. Results Forty-nine LNs were imaged in 25 mice. Among metastatic LNs, tumor size ranged from scattered cells to 2.8 mm. The strongest predictor of LN metastasis was the ratio of peak 10% PA melanin signal in the LN compared with adjacent soft tissue (median 4.22 for positive LNs vs 1.07 for negative LNs, P < 0.0001). The AUC was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-1.00). In phantom studies, B16 tumor cells were detectable at a concentration of 10 to 25 cells/mu L and at a tissue depth of 2.5-3 cm. Conclusions We identified a simple, objective diagnostic parameter for identifying melanoma LN metastases in vivo. These findings may help inform the design of future clinical trials.;2019;10.1002/jso.25447
J;Laser Speckle Integrated Multispectral Imaging System for In-Vivo Assessment of Diabetic Foot Ulcer Healing: A Clinical Study;The high prevalence of the world's population diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, with a significant number suffering from diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), has always been a global concern over the years. The rapid rise of this disease in the last decades is deemed increasingly alarming as it has left deleterious effects not only on affected patients but also on the society and nation. This paper aims to develop a reliable diagnostic tool to address the tremendous need for coordinated and efficient DFU management via prediction of transcutaneous oxygen saturation (StO2) and relative blood perfusion (tau) in the affected limb. This system integrates the use of a multispectral imaging and laser speckle contrast imaging technique for two-dimensional (2D) mapping of tissue oxygen and blood perfusion level in ulcerated foot. Longitudinal study revealed a slightly higher mean StO2 and tau level in healed ulcer than in impaired healing, despite the data indicating no statistical significance between these two groups.p value > 0 :05 /. It was observed that a mean StO2 of at least 70 % and tau value of 1.5 (x10(3)) are necessary during the proliferative phase to ensure progressive healing. Based on these findings, this study concluded that high tissue oxygenation and perfusion levels are pivotal to ensure progressive wound healing. This work provides a rationale for evaluating the healing outcomes of skin grafting procedures in diabetic ulcers based on observation of quantitative changes in blood perfusion and tissue oxygen level during its revascularization phase.;2021;10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3055221
C;In vivo demonstration of real-time oxygen saturation imaging using a portable and affordable LED-based multispectral photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging system;Photoacoustic imaging is a hybrid medical imaging technique that combines the contrast and spectral sensitivity of optical imaging with resolution and tissue penetration of ultrasound. Due to the difference between the optical absorption spectra of deoxygenated and oxygenated hemoglobin, multispectral photoacoustic imaging holds strong potential in non-invasive local blood oxygen saturation imaging. Oxygen saturation imaging is one of the most promising applications of photoacoustic imaging and has been widely explored in studies related to tumor hypoxia, cancer therapy etc. However, clinical translation of this technology has often been limited by bulky and expensive excitation sources. Recently, we introduced a multi-wavelength real-time LED-based photoacoustic/ ultrasound imaging system. In this work, potential of this LED-based system in real-time oxygen saturation imaging is demonstrated using an in vivo measurement on a human volunteer. We used ultra-fast switching two-wavelength LED arrays ( 750nm/850nm) along with a linear-array 7 MHz US probe for the experiments. 2D PA, US, and oxygen saturation imaging were performed on the index finger of a human volunteer. Results demonstrate that LED-based PA imaging system used in this study is promising for generating 2D/ 3D oxygen saturation maps along with PA and US images in real-time. We believe that these results will have profound impact in non-invasive blood oxygen saturation imaging and subsequent clinical translation of PA-based oximetry.;2019;10.1117/12.2510636
J;Constrained Inversion and Spectral Unmixing in Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography;Accurate extraction of physical and biochemical parameters from optoacoustic images is often impeded due to the use of unrigorous inversion schemes, incomplete tomographic detection coverage, or other experimental factors that cannot be readily accounted for during the image acquisition and reconstruction process. For instance, inaccurate assumptions in the physical forward model may lead to negative optical absorption values in the reconstructed images. Any artifacts present in the single wavelength optoacoustic images can be significantly aggravated when performing a two-step reconstruction consisting in acoustic inversion and spectral unmixing aimed at rendering the distributions of spectrally distinct absorbers. We investigate a number of algorithmic strategies with non-negativity constraints imposed at the different phases of the reconstruction process. Performance is evaluated in cross-sectional multispectral optoacoustic tomography recordings from tissue-mimicking phantoms and in vivo mice embedded with varying concentrations of contrast agents. Additional in vivo validation is subsequently performed with molecular imaging data involving subcutaneous tumors labeled with genetically expressed iRFP proteins and organ perfusion by optical contrast agents. It is shown that constrained reconstruction is essential for reducing the critical image artifacts associated with inaccurate modeling assumptions. Furthermore, imposing the non-negativity constraint directly on the unmixed distribution of the probe of interest was found to maintain the most robust and accurate reconstruction performance in all experiments.;2017;10.1109/TMI.2017.2686006
J;Analysis of skin morphological features and real-time monitoring using snapshot hyperspectral imaging;We propose a snapshot hyperspectral imaging system and methods for skin morphological feature analysis and real-time monitoring of skin activities. The analysis method includes a strategy using weighted subtractions between sub-channel images to extract absorption information due to specific chromophores within skin tissue, for example hemoglobin and melanin. Based on morphological analysis results, we carry out real-time monitoring of the skin features to verify the ability of this method to provide temporal responses of the skin tissue activities, which is experimentally shown to be useful in the measurement of heartrate, monitoring of the tissue recovery after a body exercise, and studying of the tissue response due to a vascular occlusion. Compared to conventional multispectral imaging system, the proposed system improves the device simplicity and is immune to motion artifacts. Coupled with the extraction algorithms, the hyperspectral imaging promises a robust skin assessment tool with abilities for qualitative visualization and potentially quantitative analysis of skin features, useful in the applications of cosmetics and clinical dermatology.

C;Non-linear laser imaging of skin lesions;We investigated different kinds of human cutaneous ex-vivo skin samples by combined two photon intrinsic fluorescence (TPE), second harmonic generation microscopy (SHG), fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), spectral lifetime imaging (SLIM), and multispectral two photon emission detection (MTPE). Morphological and spectroscopic differences were found between healthy and pathological skin samples, including tumors. In particular, we examined tissue samples from normal and pathological scar tissue (keloid), and skin tumors, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and malignant melanoma (MM). By using combined TPE-SHG microscopy we investigated morphological features of different skin regions, as BCC, tumor stroma, healthy dermis, fibroblastic proliferation, and keloids. A score, based on the SHG to autofluorescence aging index of dermis (SAAID), was assigned to characterize each region. We found that both BCC and surrounding dermis have a negative SAAID value, tumor stroma has a positive SAAID value, whereas fibroblastic proliferation and keloids have a SAAID value close to the unit. Further comparative analysis of healthy skin and neoplastic samples was performed using FLIM, SLIM, and MTPE. In particular, BCC showed a blue-shifted fluorescence emission, a higher fluorescence response at 800 nm excitation wavelength and a slightly longer mean fluorescence lifetime. MM showed an emission spectrum similar to the corresponding healthy skin emission spectrum, and a mean fluorescence lifetime distribution shifted towards shorter values. Finally, the use of aminolevulinic acid as a contrast agent has been demonstrated to increase the constrast in BCC border detection. The results obtained represent further support for in-vivo non-invasive imaging of diseased skin.;2007;10.1117/12.727818
J;Robust near real-time estimation of physiological parameters from megapixel multispectral images with inverse Monte Carlo and random forest regression;Multispectral imaging can provide reflectance measurements at multiple spectral bands for each image pixel. These measurements can be used for estimation of important physiological parameters, such as oxygenation, which can provide indicators for the success of surgical treatment or the presence of abnormal tissue. The goal of this work was to develop a method to estimate physiological parameters in an accurate and rapid manner suited for modern high-resolution laparoscopic images. While previous methods for oxygenation estimation are based on either simple linear methods or complex model-based approaches exclusively suited for off-line processing, we propose a new approach that combines the high accuracy of model-based approaches with the speed and robustness of modern machine learning methods. Our concept is based on training random forest regressors using reflectance spectra generated with Monte Carlo simulations. According to extensive in silico and in vivo experiments, the method features higher accuracy and robustness than state-of-the-art online methods and is orders of magnitude faster than other nonlinear regression based methods. Our current implementation allows for near real-time oxygenation estimation from megapixel multispectral images and is thus well suited for online tissue analysis.;2016;10.1007/s11548-016-1376-5
J;Evaluation of Cerebral Hemodynamics and Tissue Morphology of In Vivo Rat Brain Using Spectral Diffuse Reflectance Imaging;We investigated a quantitative imaging of reduced scattering coefficients mu(s)'(lambda) and the absorption coefficients mu(a)(lambda) of in vivo cortical tissues in the range from visible to near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths based on diffuse reflectance spectral imaging technique. In this method, diffuse reflectance images of in vivo cortical tissue are acquired at nine wavelengths (500, 520, 540, 560, 570, 580, 600, 730, and 760 nm). A multiple regression analysis aided by the Monte Carlo simulation for the absorbance spectra is then utilized to estimate the optical coefficients of cortical tissue. This analysis calculates the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin and that of deoxygenated hemoglobin, the scattering amplitude a and the scattering power b. The spectrum of absorption coefficient is deduced from the estimated concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin. The spectrum of reduced scattering coefficient is determined by the estimated scattering amplitude and scattering power. The particle size distribution of microstructure is calculated from the estimated scattering power b for evaluating the morphological change in brain tissue quantitatively. Animal experiments with in vivo exposed brain of rats demonstrated that the responses of the absorption properties to hyperoxic and anoxic conditions are in agreement with the expected well-known cortical hemodynamics. The average particle size was significantly reduced immediately after the onset of anoxia and then it was changed into an increase, which implied the swelling and shrinkage of the cellular and subcellular structures induced by loss of tissue viability in brain tissue.;2017;10.1177/0003702816657569
J;Objective Detection of Oral Carcinoma with Multispectral Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging In Vivo;Successful early detection and demarcation of oral carcinoma can greatly impact the associated morbidity and mortality rates. Current methods for detection of oral cancer include comprehensive visual examination of the oral cavity, typically followed by tissue biopsy. A noninvasive means to guide the clinician in making a more objective and informed decision toward tissue biopsy can potentially improve the diagnostic yield of this process. To this end, we investigate the potential of fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) for objective detection of oral carcinoma in the hamster cheek pouch model of oral carcinogenesis in vivo. We report that systematically selected FLIM features can differentiate between low-risk (normal, benign and low-grade dysplasia) and high-risk (high-grade dysplasia and cancer) oral lesions with sensitivity and specificity of 87.26% and 93.96%, respectively. We also show the ability of FLIM to generate disease maps of the tissue which can be used to evaluate relative risk of neoplasia. The results demonstrate the potential of multispectral FLIM with objective image analysis as a noninvasive tool to guide comprehensive oral examination.;2016;10.1111/php.12627
J;Multispectral analog-mean-delay fluorescence lifetime imaging combined with optical coherence tomography;The pathophysiological progression of chronic diseases, including atherosclerosis and cancer, is closely related to compositional changes in biological tissues containing endogenous fluorophores such as collagen, elastin, and NADH, which exhibit strong autofluorescence under ultraviolet excitation. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) provides robust detection of the compositional changes by measuring fluorescence lifetime, which is an inherent property of a fluorophore. In this paper, we present a dual-modality system combining a multispectral analog-mean-delay (AMD) FLIm and a high-speed swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) to simultaneously visualize the cross-sectional morphology and biochemical compositional information of a biological tissue. Experiments using standard fluorescent solutions showed that the fluorescence lifetime could be measured with a precision of less than 40 psec using the multispectral AMD-FLIm without averaging. In addition, we performed ex vivo imaging on rabbit iliac normal-looking and atherosclerotic specimens to demonstrate the feasibility of the combined FLIm-OCT system for atherosclerosis imaging. We expect that the combined FLIm-OCT will be a promising nextgeneration imaging technique for diagnosing atherosclerosis and cancer due to the advantages of the proposed label-free high-precision multispectral lifetime measurement.

J;SPLASSH: Open source software for camera-based high-speed, multispectral in-vivo optical image acquisition;Camera-based in-vivo optical imaging can provide detailed images of living tissue that reveal structure, function, and disease. Highspeed, high resolution imaging can reveal dynamic events such as changes in blood flow and responses to stimulation. Despite these benefits, commercially available scientific cameras rarely include software that is suitable for in-vivo imaging applications, making this highly versatile form of optical imaging challenging and time-consuming to implement. To address this issue, we have developed a novel, open-source software package to control high-speed, multispectral optical imaging systems. The software integrates a number of modular functions through a custom graphical user interface (GUI) and provides extensive control over a wide range of inexpensive IEEE 1394 Firewire cameras. Multispectral illumination can be incorporated through the use of off-the-shelf light emitting diodes which the software synchronizes to image acquisition via a programmed microcontroller, allowing arbitrary high-speed illumination sequences. The complete software suite is available for free download. Here we describe the software's framework and provide details to guide users with development of this and similar software.

J;Uniqueness in multispectral constant-wave epi-illumination imaging;Multispectral tissue imaging based on optical cameras and continuous-wave tissue illumination is commonly used in medicine and biology. Surprisingly, there is a characteristic absence of a critical look at the quantities that can be uniquely characterized from optically diffuse matter by multispectral imaging. Here, we investigate the fundamental question of uniqueness in epi-illumination measurements from turbid media obtained at multiple wavelengths. By utilizing an analytical model, tissue-mimicking phantoms, and an in vivo imaging experiment we show that independent of the bands employed, spectral measurements cannot uniquely retrieve absorption and scattering coefficients. We also establish that it is, nevertheless, possible to uniquely quantify oxygen saturation and the Mie scattering power-a previously undocumented uniqueness condition.

J;Hyperspectral imaging for head and neck cancer detection: specular glare and variance of the tumor margin in surgical specimens;Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is primarily managed by surgical cancer resection. Recurrence rates after surgery can be as high as 55%, if residual cancer is present. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is evaluated for detection of SCC in ex-vivo surgical specimens. Several machine learning methods are investigated, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a spectral-spatial classification framework based on support vector machines. Quantitative results demonstrate that additional data preprocessing and unsupervised segmentation can improve CNN results to achieve optimal performance. The methods are trained in two paradigms, with and without specular glare. Classifying regions that include specular glare degrade the overall results, but the combination of the CNN probability maps and unsupervised segmentation using a majority voting method produces an area under the curve value of 0.81 [0.80, 0.83]. As the wavelengths of light used in HSI can penetrate different depths into biological tissue, cancer margins may change with depth and create uncertainty in the ground truth. Through serial histological sectioning, the variance in the cancer margin with depth is investigated and paired with qualitative classification heat maps using the methods proposed for the testing group of SCC patients. The results determined that the validity of the top section alone as the ground truth may be limited to 1 to 2 mm. The study of specular glare and margin variation provided better understanding of the potential of HSI for the use in the operating room.

J;Non-invasive pH determination adjacent to degradable biomaterials in vivo;An appropriate pH level is an important prerequisite for the physiologal functioning of cells and tissues. Changes in the extracellular pH often lead to specific cellular reactions and an altered metabolism of cells and tissues influences the extracellular pH range. Thus a method to monitor the extracellular pH is a valuable tool to track specific tissue reactions. In this article we describe a method for the determination of the pH range adjacent to degradable biomaterials using wireless in vivo imaging. Using hairless but immunocompetent mice the fluorophor 5-(6)-carboxy SNARF-1 and the in vivo fluorescence and multispectral acquisition and analysis system Maestro it is possible to track shifts in pH in small living animals over a longer period of time. This method is especially suitable for studies which focus on the interaction of degrading biomaterials with their adjacent tissues. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J;Portable, low-cost multispectral imaging system: design, development, validation, and utilization;Optical spectral images can be used to estimate the amount of bulk absorbers in tissues, specifically oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin, as well as scattering parameters. Most systems that capture spectral image data are large, heavy, and expensive. This paper presents a full end-to-end analysis of a low-cost reflectance-mode multispectral imaging system operating in the visible and near-infrared spectra. The system consists of 13 LEDs mounted on a printed circuit board, a monochrome machine vision camera, and a tablet computer to control the hardware. The bill of materials for the system is less than $1000. Hardware design and implementation are detailed. Calibration, image capture, and preprocessing are also discussed. In validation experiments, excellent agreement is observed in diffuse reflectance measurements between the spectral camera setup and a spectrometer. To demonstrate that such spectral image data can yield meaningful optical measurements in vivo, the forearms of eight volunteers are imaged in the system. Their data are then analyzed to estimate the tissue optical properties of different skin layers using a Monte Carlo lookup table. In three volunteers, spectral images are captured before and after inducing erythema using a warm wet towel. Across the three subjects, a clear increase in the blood content of the superficial plexus layer was observed as a result of the erythema. Collectively, these findings suggest that a low-cost system can capture accurate spectral data and that clinically meaningful information can be derived from it. (C) The Authors.

J;Optical Hyperspectral Image Cryptosystem Based on Affine Transform and Fractional Fourier Transform;An encryption algorithm for hyperspectral data in fractional Fourier domain is designed. Firstly, the original hyperspectral image is separated into single bands and then each pair of bands are regarded as the real and imaginary part of a complex function by using an affine transform. Subsequently, the complex functions are encoded and transformed in fractional Fourier domain (FrFT). The parameters in affine transform and FrFT serve as the key of the encryption system. The proposed encryption scheme can not only protect the image information in spatial domains but also the spectrum information in spectral domains. Various experiments are given to demonstrate the validity and capability of the proposed encryption scheme.;2019;10.3390/app9020330
J;Ex Vivo Assessment of Various Histological Differentiation in Human Carotid Plaque with Near-infrared Spectroscopy Using Multiple Wavelengths;We previously reported that near-infrared hyperspectral imaging enabled the localization of atherosclerotic plaques from outside the vessels, but not the optical characteristics of each histological component. Therefore, the near-infrared spectrum of each component was collected from the sliced section of the human carotid plaque obtained with endarterectomy and the optical characteristics were confirmed in several wavelengths. Based on this information, we assessed the diagnostic accuracy for ex vivo chemo-gram in each plaque component created with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), using multiple wavelengths. The chemogram projected on the actual image of plaque was created based on light intensity and transmittance change at three wavelengths. The wavelengths that were mainly were 1440, 1620, 1730, and 1930 nm. We evaluated the accuracy of histological diagnosis in chemogram compared with pathological findings, analyzing interobserver agreement with kappa-statistics. The chemograms that we created depicted the components of fibrous tissue, smooth muscle, lipid tissue, intraplaque hemorrhage, and calcification. Diagnostic odds ratio in each component was as follows: 259.6 in fibrous tissue, 144 in smooth muscle, 1123.5 in lipid tissue, 29.3 in intraplaque hemorrhage, and 136.3 in calcification. The k-statistics revealed that four components, excluding intraplaque hemorrhage, had substantial or almost perfect agreement. Thus, this study demonstrated the feasibility of using chemogram focused on specific component during the histological assessment of atherosclerotic plaques, highlighting its potential diagnostic ability. Chemo-grams of various target components can be created by combining multiple wavelengths. This technology may prove to be useful in improving the histological assessment of plaque using NIRS.;2019;10.2176/nmc.oa.2018-0203
J;Comparison of Hyperspectral Imaging and Microvascular Doppler for Perfusion Monitoring of Free Flaps in an In Vivo Rodent Model;To reduce microvascular free flap failure (MFF), monitoring is crucial for the early detection of malperfusion and allows timely salvage. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in comparison to micro-Doppler sonography (MDS) to monitor MFF perfusion in an in vivo rodent model. Bilateral groin flaps were raised on 20 Sprague-Dawley rats. The femoral artery was transected on the trial side and re-anastomosed. Flaps and anastomoses were assessed before, during, and after the period of ischemia every ten minutes for overall 60 min using HSI and MDS. The contralateral sides' flaps served as controls. Tissue-oxygenation saturation (StO(2)), near-infrared perfusion index (NPI), hemoglobin (THI), and water distribution (TWI) were assessed by HSI, while blood flow was assessed by MDS. HSI correlates with the MDS signal in the case of sufficient and completely interrupted perfusion. HSI was able to validly and reproducibly detect tissue perfusion status using StO(2) and NPI. After 40 min, flap perfusion decreased due to the general aggravation of hemodynamic circulatory situation, which resulted in a significant drop of StO(2) (p < 0.005) and NPI (p < 0.005), whereas the Doppler signal remained unchanged. In accordance, HSI might be suitable to detect MFF general complications in an early stage and further decrease MFF failure rates, whereas MDS may only be used for direct complications at the anastomose site.;2022;10.3390/jcm11144134
C;Hyperspectral imaging system for monitoring laser-induced thermal damage in gastric mucosa;"Minimally invasive techniques are gaining a major role in treating superficial gastrointestinal cancers. Energy-based approaches have been investigated as potential alternative to the gold-standard techniques (e.g., Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection). Among these techniques, the laser has been studied for achieving a selective ablation of the gastric mucosa. Together with the optimization of the laser settings for avoiding tissue perforation or insufficient ablation, a tool providing quantitative information about the intraoperative tissue state can support the treatment guidance. This work aims at providing a novel non-invasive approach based on the use of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for monitoring ablative therapy in in vivo gastric mucosa. The three-dimensional datasets generated by the HSI provide spatial and spectral information of the scene, thus collecting tissue optical features during the ablation therapy in each pixel of the images. The operation of a diode laser focused on the porcine gastric mucosa was controlled in accordance with chosen temperature thresholds (i.e., 36, 60, 70, 80, 100, 110 degrees C), measured with a thermographic camera. HSIs of the living gastric mucosa undergoing laser procedure hold diagnostic information about the thermal outcome. Two tests have been performed, and the temperature dependence of three characteristic spectral wavelengths have been analysed: oxyhemoglobin (Hb0(2)) in the visible range 500-600 nm, methemoglobin (metHb) around 630 nm, and deoxyhemoglobin (Hb) at 760 nm. The data have been processed in terms of absorbance at the set temperature relative to the absorbance at initial body temperature (36 degrees C). After 60 degrees C the percentage relative absorbance of metHb increased significantly in both tests (i.e., 92.3 +/- 1.9 % at 70 degrees C and 229.4 +/- 4.7% at 100 degrees C in Test2); regarding the Hb at 110 degrees C, Test1 reported an increase of 43.8 +/- 1.7 %, versus 127.2 +/- 3.8% in the Test2. On the other hand, HbO(2) chromophore experiences an increase only for the first stages of heating later decreasing in favour of metHb and Hb formation. In both tests, similar trends for characteristic wavelengths are found, thus demonstrating the potential of the HSI measurement in laser-induced thermal damage monitoring. Although optical response show dependence on the tissue type and condition, this finding encourages future studies to standardize this promising technique.";2020;
J;In vivo near-infrared fluorescence three-dimensional positioning system with binocular stereovision;Fluorescence is a powerful tool for in-vivo imaging in living animals. The traditional in-vivo fluorescence imaging equipment is based on single-view two-dimensional imaging systems. However, they cannot meet the needs for accurate positioning during modern scientific research. A near-infrared in-vivo fluorescence imaging system is demonstrated, which has the capability of deep source signal detecting and three-dimensional positioning. A three-dimensional coordinates computing (TDCP) method including a preprocess algorithm is presented based on binocular stereo vision theory, to figure out the solution for diffusive nature of light in tissue and the emission spectra overlap of fluorescent labels. This algorithm is validated to be efficient to extract targets from multispectral images and determine the spot center of biological interests. Further data analysis indicates that this TDCP method could be used in three-dimensional positioning of the fluorescent target in small animals. The study also suggests that the combination of a large power laser and deep cooling charge-coupled device will provide an attractive approach for fluorescent detection from deep sources. This work demonstrates the potential of binocular stereo vision theory for three-dimensional positioning for living animal in-vivo imaging. (C) The Authors.

J;In-vivo fluorescence imaging with a multivariate curve resolution spectral unmixing technique;Spectral unmixing is a useful technique in fluorescence imaging for reducing the effects of native tissue autofluorescence and separating multiple fluorescence probes. While spectral unmixing methods are well established in fluorescence microscopy, they typically rely on precharacterized in-vitro spectra for each fluorophore. However, there are unique challenges for in-vivo applications, since the tissue absorption and scattering can have a significant impact on the measured spectrum of the fluorophore, and therefore make the in-vivo spectra substantially different to that of in vitro. In this work, we introduce a spectral unmixing algorithm tailored for in-vivo optical imaging that does not rely on precharacterized spectral libraries. It is derived from a multivariate curve resolution (MCR) method, which has been widely used in studies of chemometrics and gene expression. Given multispectral images and a few straightforward constraints such as non-negativity, the algorithm automatically finds the signal distribution and the pure spectrum of each component. Signal distribution maps help separate autofluorescence from other probes in the raw images and hence provide better quantification and localization for each probe. The algorithm is demonstrated with an extensive set of in-vivo experiments using near-infrared dyes and quantum dots in both epi-illumination and transillumination geometries.

J;Most Relevant Spectral Bands Identification for Brain Cancer Detection Using Hyperspectral Imaging;Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a non-ionizing and non-contact imaging technique capable of obtaining more information than conventional RGB (red green blue) imaging. In the medical field, HSI has commonly been investigated due to its great potential for diagnostic and surgical guidance purposes. However, the large amount of information provided by HSI normally contains redundant or non-relevant information, and it is extremely important to identify the most relevant wavelengths for a certain application in order to improve the accuracy of the predictions and reduce the execution time of the classification algorithm. Additionally, some wavelengths can contain noise and removing such bands can improve the classification stage. The work presented in this paper aims to identify such relevant spectral ranges in the visual-and-near-infrared (VNIR) region for an accurate detection of brain cancer using in vivo hyperspectral images. A methodology based on optimization algorithms has been proposed for this task, identifying the relevant wavelengths to achieve the best accuracy in the classification results obtained by a supervised classifier (support vector machines), and employing the lowest possible number of spectral bands. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology based on the genetic algorithm optimization slightly improves the accuracy of the tumor identification in similar to 5%, using only 48 bands, with respect to the reference results obtained with 128 bands, offering the possibility of developing customized acquisition sensors that could provide real-time HS imaging. The most relevant spectral ranges found comprise between 440.5-465.96 nm, 498.71-509.62 nm, 556.91-575.1 nm, 593.29-615.12 nm, 636.94-666.05 nm, 698.79-731.53 nm and 884.32-902.51 nm.;2019;10.3390/s19245481
C;Autofluorescence removal from fluorescence tomography data using multispectral imaging;Autofluorescence has been a significant disadvantage when dealing with tomographic imaging of biological samples or tissue phantoms. Consequently, the accurate removal of autofluorescence signal has been a major concern in fluorescence tomography. Here we present a study on three-dimensional mapping and removal of autofluorescence from fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) data, both for phantoms and small animal in vivo. The technique is based on the recording of tomographic data in multiple spectral regions with different excitation light and on the application of a linear uninixing algorithm for targeting multiple fluorescent probes. Two types of measurements are taken, one with the excitation being in the region of the maximum absorption of the targeted fluorophore and one in a region away from the maximum. The relative strengths of the different spectra are employed to calculate the signal to be removed from the tomographic reconstruction. Autofluorescence spectra are recorded using identical reflection geometry as during the FMT acquisitions allowing for the correct mapping of the autofluorescence signal. Results from phantoms exhibiting different background autofluorescence strengths are presented and discussed. In this work we have also studied in vivo fluorescent activity in mice, involving both subcutaneously implanted fluorescent phantoms and b10 transgenic mice.;2007;10.1117/12.728305
C;Identifying Oral Cancer using Multispectral Snapshot Camera;Multispectral imaging has emerged as an effective tool for detecting malignant changes affiliated with cancers. The added spectral dimension enables the visualization of underlying biochemical information in tissues. Unfortunately, existing acquisition systems which use multispectral filter wheels or variable light source for spectral data collection, face the challenge of co-registration and are hard to be realized in real-time as acquisition time per frame is high. A Multispectral SnapShot Camera (MSSC) is demonstrated to address these obstacles, which is capable of capturing data simultaneously in multiple wavelengths with a single click. This brings down the total acquisition time to a few milliseconds per data cube (spatial+spectral) which encourages translation of this technology for real-time diagnosis. The MSSC is composed of 16 spectral bands with peak wavelengths in the visible range 460 nm - 600 nm. The application of MSSC in the field of oral cancer diagnosis has been demonstrated with in-vivo tissue images captured from 10 patients with oral dysplasia. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) was used to differentiate between healthy and malignant tissue. PCA was used to compress the multispectral datacube to extract wavelengths with maximum variance and SAM discriminates between tissue conditions based on distinct spectral profiles. The mean absorption spectrum plotted for them shows a trend of higher absorption peak value in malignant tissue regions than in healthy regions, thereby demonstrating the capability of MSSC for tumor tissue classification.;2022;10.1109/MEMEA54994.2022.9856427
C;Hyperspectral imaging for colon cancer classification in surgical specimens: towards optical biopsy during image-guided surgery;The main curative treatment for localized colon cancer is surgical resection. However, when tumor residuals are left, positive margins are found during the histological examinations and additional treatment is needed to inhibit recurrence. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) can offer non-invasive surgical guidance with the potential of optimizing the surgical effectiveness. In this paper, we investigate the capability of HSI for automated colon cancer detection in six ex-vivo specimens, employing a spectral-spatial patch-based classification approach. The results demonstrate the feasibility in assessing the benign and malignant boundaries of the lesion with a sensitivity of 0.88 and specificity of 0.78. The results are compared with the state-of-the-art deep learning based approaches. The method with a new hybrid CNN outperforms the state-of theart approaches, (0.74 vs. 0.82 AUC). This study paves the way for further investigation towards improving surgical outcomes with HSI.;2020;
J;A background correction method to compensate illumination variation in hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) can measure both spatial (morphological) and spectral (biochemical) information from biological tissues. While HSI appears promising for biomedical applications, interpretation of hyperspectral images can be challenging when data is acquired in complex biological environments. Variations in surface topology or optical power distribution at the sample, encountered for example during endoscopy, can lead to errors in post-processing of the HSI data, compromising disease diagnostic capabilities. Here, we propose a background correction method to compensate for such variations, which estimates the optical properties of illumination at the target based on the normalised spectral profile of the light source and the measured HSI intensity values at a fixed wavelength where the absorption characteristics of the sample are relatively low (in this case, 800 nm). We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method by imaging blood samples, tissue-mimicking phantoms, and ex vivo chicken tissue. Moreover, using synthetic HSI data composed from experimentally measured spectra, we show the proposed method would improve statistical analysis of HSI data. The proposed method could help the implementation of HSI techniques in practical clinical applications, where controlling the illumination pattern and power is difficult.;2020;10.1371/journal.pone.0229502
J;Hyperspectral imaging for monitoring of perfusion failure upon microvascular anastomosis in the rat hind limb;Background/purpose: Objective, reliable and easy monitoring of microvascular tissue perfusion is a goal that was achieved for many years with limited success. Therefore, a new non-invasive hyperspectral camera system (TIVITA (TM)) was tested for this purpose in an in vivo animal model. Methods: Evaluation of tissue oxygenation during ischemia and upon reperfusion was performed in left hind limb in a rat model (n = 20). Ischemia was induced by clamping and dissection of the superficial femoral artery. Reperfusion of the limb was achieved by microsurgical anastomosis of the dissected artery. Oxygenation parameters of the hind limb were assessed via TIVITA (TM) before and immediately after clamping and dissection of the artery, 3 and 30 min after reperfusion as well as on postoperative days 1 and 2. Thereby, the non-operated hind limb served as control. As clinical parameters, the refill of the anastomosis as well as the progress of the affected leg were assessed. Results: In 12 from 20 cases, TIVITA (TM) recorded a sufficient reperfusion with oxygenation parameters comparable to baseline or control condition. However, in 8 from 20 cases oxygenation was found impaired after re perfusion causing a re-assessment of the microvascular anastomosis. Thereby, technical problems like stenosis or local thrombosis were found in all cases and were surgically treated leading to an increased tissue oxygenation. Conclusions: The TIVITA (TM) camera system is a valid non-invasive tool to assess tissue perfusion after micro vascular anastomosis. As it safely shows problems in oxygenation, it allows the clinician a determined revision of the site in time in order to prevent prolonged ischemia.;2018;10.1016/j.mvr.2017.10.005
J;Skin Complications of Diabetes Mellitus Revealed by Polarized Hyperspectral Imaging and Machine Learning;Aging and diabetes lead to protein glycation and cause dysfunction of collagen-containing tissues. The accompanying structural and functional changes of collagen significantly contribute to the development of various pathological malformations affecting the skin, blood vessels, and nerves, causing a number of complications, increasing disability risks and threat to life. In fact, no methods of non-invasive assessment of glycation and associated metabolic processes in biotissues or prediction of possible skin complications, e.g., ulcers, currently exist for endocrinologists and clinical diagnosis. In this publication, utilizing emerging photonics-based technology, innovative solutions in machine learning, and definitive physiological characteristics, we introduce a diagnostic approach capable of evaluating the skin complications of diabetes mellitus at the very earlier stage. The results of the feasibility studies, as well as the actual tests on patients with diabetes and healthy volunteers, clearly show the ability of the approach to differentiate diabetic and control groups. Furthermore, the developed in-house polarization-based hyperspectral imaging technique accomplished with the implementation of the artificial neural network provides new horizons in the study and diagnosis of age-related diseases.;2021;10.1109/TMI.2021.3049591
J;Real-time multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging using Single Photon Avalanche Diode arrays;Autofluorescence spectroscopy has emerged in recent years as a powerful tool to report label-free contrast between normal and diseased tissues, both in vivo and ex vivo. We report the development of an instrument employing Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) arrays to realize real-time multispectral autofluorescence lifetime imaging at a macroscopic scale using handheld single-point fibre optic probes, under bright background conditions. At the detection end, the fluorescence signal is passed through a transmission grating and both spectral and temporal information are encoded in the SPAD array. This configuration allows interrogation in the spectral range of interest in real time. Spatial information is provided by an external camera together with a guiding beam that provides a visual reference that is tracked in real-time. Through fast image processing and data analysis, fluorescence lifetime maps are augmented on white light images to provide feedback of the measurements in real-time. We validate and demonstrate the practicality of this technique in the reference fluorophores and in articular cartilage samples mimicking the degradation that occurs in osteoarthritis. Our results demonstrate that SPADs together with fibre probes can offer means to report autofluorescence spectral and lifetime contrast in real-time and thus are suitable candidates for in situ tissue diagnostics.;2020;10.1038/s41598-020-65218-3
J;Hyperspectral Microscopy of Near-Infrared Fluorescence Enables 17-Chirality Carbon Nanotube Imaging;The intrinsic near-infrared photoluminescence (fluorescence) of single-walled carbon nanotubes exhibits unique photostability, narrow bandwidth, penetration through biological media, environmental sensitivity, and both chromatic variety and range. Biomedical applications exploiting this large family of fluorophores will require the spectral and spatial resolution of individual (n,m) nanotube species' fluorescence and its modulation within live cells and tissues, which is not possible with current microscopy methods. We present a wide-field hyperspectral approach to spatially delineate and spectroscopically measure single nanotube fluorescence in living systems. This approach resolved up to 17 distinct (n, m) species (chiralities) with single nanotube spatial resolution in live mammalian cells, murine tissues ex vivo, and zebrafish endothelium in vivo. We anticipate that this approach will facilitate multiplexed nanotube imaging in biomedical applications while enabling deep-tissue optical penetration, and single-molecule resolution in vivo.;2015;10.1038/srep14167
J;Hyperspectral imaging in wound care: A systematic review;Multispectral and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) are emerging imaging techniques with the potential to transform the way patients with wounds are cared for, but it is not clear whether current systems are capable of delivering real-time tissue characterisation and treatment guidance. We conducted a systematic review of HSI systems that have been assessed in patients, published over the past 32 years. We analysed 140 studies, including 10 different HSI systems. Current in vivo HSI systems generate a tissue oxygenation map. Tissue oxygenation measurements may help to predict those patients at risk of wound formation or delayed healing. No safety concerns were reported in any studies. A small number of studies have demonstrated the capabilities of in vivo label-free HSI, but further work is needed to fully integrate it into the current clinical workflow for different wound aetiologies. As an emerging imaging modality for medical applications, HSI offers great potential for non-invasive disease diagnosis and guidance when treating patients with both acute and chronic wounds.;2020;10.1111/iwj.13474
J;Estimation of the number of fluorescent end-members for quantitative analysis of multispectral FLIM data;Multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging (m-FLIM) can potentially allow identifying the endogenous fluorophores present in biological tissue. Quantitative description of such data requires estimating the number of components in the sample, their characteristic fluorescent decays, and their relative contributions or abundances. Unfortunately, this inverse problem usually requires prior knowledge about the data, which is seldom available in biomedical applications. This work presents a new methodology to estimate the number of potential endogenous fluorophores present in biological tissue samples from time-domain m-FLIM data. Furthermore, a completely blind linear unmixing algorithm is proposed. The method was validated using both synthetic and experimental m-FLIM data. The experimental m-FLIM data include in-vivo measurements from healthy and cancerous hamster cheek-pouch epithelial tissue, and ex-vivo measurements from human coronary atherosclerotic plaques. The analysis of m-FLIM data from in-vivo hamster oral mucosa identified healthy from precancerous lesions, based on the relative concentration of their characteristic fluorophores. The algorithm also provided a better description of atherosclerotic plaques in term of their endogenous fluorophores. These results demonstrate the potential of this methodology to provide quantitative description of tissue biochemical composition. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America;2014;10.1364/OE.22.012255
J;Noninvasive imaging of hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation for detection of osteoarthritis in the finger joints using multispectral three-dimensional quantitative photoacoustic tomography;We present quantitative imaging of hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation in in vivo finger joints and evaluate the feasibility of detecting osteoarthritis (OA) in the hand using three-dimensional (3D) multispectral quantitative photoacoustic tomography (3D qPAT). The results show that both the anatomical structures and quantitative chromophore concentrations (oxy-hemoglobin and deoxy-hemoglobin) of different joint tissues (hard phalanges and soft cartilage/synovial fluid between phalanges) can be imaged in vivo with the multispectral 3D qPAT. Enhanced hemoglobin concentrations and dropped oxygen saturations in osteoarthritic phalanges and soft joint tissues in joint cavities have been observed. This study indicates that the multispectral 3D qPAT is a promising approach to detect the angiogenesis and hypoxia associated with OA disease and a potential clinical tool for early OA detection in the finger joints.;2013;10.1088/2040-8978/15/5/055302
C;In vivo skin chromophore mapping using a multimode imaging dermoscope (SkinSpect (TM));We introduce a multimode dermoscope (SkinSpect (TM)) we developed for early detection of melanoma by combining fluorescence, polarization and hyperspectral imaging. Acquired reflection image datacubes were input to a wavelength-dependent linear model to extract the relative contributions of skin chromophores at every pixel. The oxy-hemoglobin, deoxy hemoglobin, melanin concentrations, and hemoglobin oxygen saturation by the single step linear least square fitting and Kubelka-Munk tissue model using cross polarization data cubes were presented. The comprehensive data obtained by SkinSpect can be utilized to improve the accuracy of skin chromophore decomposition algorithm with less computation cost. As an example in this work, the deoxy-hemoglobin over-estimation error in highly pigmented lesion due to melanin and deoxy hemoglobin spectral cross talk were analyzed and corrected using two-step linear least square fitting procedure at different wavelength ranges. The proposed method also tested in skin with underlying vein area for validating the proof of concept.;2013;10.1117/12.2005587
J;Phasor analysis of multiphoton spectral images distinguishes autofluorescence components of in vivo human skin;Skin contains many autofluorescent components that can be studied using spectral imaging. We employed a spectral phasor method to analyse two photon excited auto-fluorescence and second harmonic generation images of in vivo human skin. This method allows segmentation of images based on spectral features. Various structures in the skin could be distinguished, including Stratum Corneum, epidermal cells and dermis. The spectral phasor analysis allowed investigation of their fluorescence composition and identification of signals from NADH, keratin, FAD, melanin, collagen and elastin. Interestingly, two populations of epidermal cells could be distinguished with different melanin content.;2014;10.1002/jbio.201200244
C;Hyperspectral imaging for thermal effect monitoring in in vivo liver during laser ablation;"Thermal ablation is a minimally invasive technique used to induce a controlled necrosis of malignant cells by increasing the temperature in localized areas. This procedure needs an accurate and real-time monitoring of thermal effects to evaluate and control treatment outcome. In this work, a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technique is proposed as a new and non-invasive method to monitor ablative therapy. HSI provides images of the target object in several spectral bands, hence the reflectance/absorbance spectrum for each pixel. This paper presents a preliminary and original HSI-based analysis of the thermal state in the in vivo porcine liver undergoing laser ablation. In order to compare the spectral response between treated and untreated areas of the organ, proper Regions of Interest (ROIs) were chosen on the hyperspectral images; for each ROI, the absorbance variation for the selected wavelengths (i.e., 630, 760, and 960nm, for deoxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, and water respectively) was assessed. Results obtained during and after laser ablation show that the absorbance of the methemoglobin peaks increases up to 40% in the burned region with respect to the non-ablated one. Conversely, the relative change of deoxyhemoglobin and water peaks is less marked. Based on these results, absorbance threshold values were retrieved and used to visualize the ablation zone on the images. This preliminary analysis suggests that a combination of the absorbance information is essential to achieve a more accurate identification of the ablation region. The results encourage further studies on the correlation between thermal effects and the spectral response of biological tissues undergoing thermal ablation, for final clinical use.";2019;
J;Fast and accurate pseudo multispectral technique for whole-brain MRI tissue classification;Numerous strategies have been proposed to classify brain tissues into gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, many of them fail when classifying specific regions with low contrast between tissues. In this work, we propose an alternative pseudo multispectral classification (PMC) technique using CIE LAB spaces instead of gray scale T1-weighted MPRAGE images, combined with a new preprocessing technique for contrast enhancement and an optimized iterative K-means clustering. To improve the accuracy of the classification process, gray scale images were converted to multispectral CIE LAB data by applying several transformation matrices. Thus, the amount of information associated with each image voxel was increased. The image contrast was then enhanced by applying a real time function that separates brain tissue distributions and improve image contrast in certain brain regions. The data were then classified using an optimized iterative and convergent K-means classifier. The performance of the proposed approach was assessed using simulation and in vivo human studies through comparison with three common software packages used for brain MR image segmentation, namely FSL, SPM8 and K-means clustering. In the presence of high SNR, the results showed that the four algorithms achieve a good classification. Conversely, in the presence of low SNR, PMC was shown to outperform the other methods by accurately recovering all tissue volumes. The quantitative assessment of brain tissue classification for simulated studies showed that the PMC algorithm resulted in a mean Jaccard index (JI) of 0.74 compared to 0.75 for FSL, 0.7 for SPM and 0.8 for K-means. The in vivo human studies showed that the PMC algorithm resulted in a mean JI of 0.92, which reflects a good spatial overlap between segmented and actual volumes, compared to 0.84 for FSL, 0.78 for SPM and 0.66 for K-means. The proposed algorithm presents a high potential for improving the accuracy of automatic brain tissues classification and was found to be accurate even in the presence of high noise level.;2019;10.1088/1361-6560/ab239e
J;Zebrabow: multispectral cell labeling for cell tracing and lineage analysis in zebrafish;Advances in imaging and cell-labeling techniques have greatly enhanced our understanding of developmental and neurobiological processes. Among vertebrates, zebrafish is uniquely suited for in vivo imaging owing to its small size and optical translucency. However, distinguishing and following cells over extended time periods remains difficult. Previous studies have demonstrated that Cre recombinase-mediated recombination can lead to combinatorial expression of spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins (RFP, YFP and CFP) in neighboring cells, creating a 'Brainbow' of colors. The random combination of fluorescent proteins provides a way to distinguish adjacent cells, visualize cellular interactions and perform lineage analyses. Here, we describe Zebrabow (Zebrafish Brainbow) tools for in vivo multicolor imaging in zebrafish. First, we show that the broadly expressed ubi: Zebrabow line provides diverse color profiles that can be optimized by modulating Cre activity. Second, we find that colors are inherited equally among daughter cells and remain stable throughout embryonic and larval stages. Third, we show that UAS: Zebrabow lines can be used in combination with Gal4 to generate broad or tissue-specific expression patterns and facilitate tracing of axonal processes. Fourth, we demonstrate that Zebrabow can be used for long-term lineage analysis. Using the cornea as a model system, we provide evidence that embryonic corneal epithelial clones are replaced by large, wedge-shaped clones formed by centripetal expansion of cells from the peripheral cornea. The Zebrabow tool set presented here provides a resource for next-generation color-based anatomical and lineage analyses in zebrafish.;2013;10.1242/dev.094631
C;Dual-radiolabeled nanoparticle probes for depth-independent in vivo imaging of enzyme activation;Quantitative and noninvasive measurement of protease activities has remained an imaging challenge in deep tissues such as the lungs. Here, we designed a dual-radiolabeled probe for reporting the activities of proteases such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) with multispectral single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. A gold nanoparticle (NP) was radiolabeled with I-125 and In-111 and functionalized with an MMP9-cleavable peptide to form a multispectral SPECT imaging contrast agent. In another design, incorporation of Au-199 radionuclide into the metal crystal structure of gold NPs provided a superior and stable reference signal in lungs, and In-111 was linked to the NP surface via a protease-cleavable substrate, which can serve as an enzyme activity reporter. This work reveals strategies to correlate protease activities with diverse pathologies in a tissue-depth independent manner.;2018;10.1117/12.2301033
J;Monitoring temporal development and healing of diabetic foot ulceration using hyperspectral imaging;This study combines non-invasive hyperspectral imaging with an experimentally validated skin optical model and inverse algorithm to monitor diabetic feet of two representative patients. It aims to observe temporal changes in local epidermal thickness and oxyhemoglobin concentration and to gain insight into the progression of foot ulcer formation and healing. Foot ulceration is a debilitating comorbidity of diabetes that may result in loss of mobility and amputation. Inflammation and necrosis preempt ulceration and can result in changes in the skin prior to ulceration and during ulcer healing that affect oxygen delivery and consumption. Previous studies estimated oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations around pre-ulcerative and ulcer sites on the diabetic foot using commercially available hyperspectral imaging systems. These measurements were successfully used to detect tissue at risk of ulceration and predict the healing potential of ulcers. The present study shows epidermal thickening and decrease in oxyhemoglobin concentration can also be detected prior to ulceration at pre-ulcerative sites. The algorithm was also able to observe reduction in the epidermal thickness combined with an increase in oxyhemoglobin concentration around the ulcer as it healed and closed. This methodology can be used for early prediction of diabetic foot ulceration in a clinical setting.;2011;10.1002/jbio.201000117
J;In vivo noninvasive detection of chlorophyll distribution in cucumber (Cucumis sativus) leaves by indices based on hyperspectral imaging;The objective of this study was to investigate the spectral behavior of the relationship between reflectance and chlorophyll content and to develop a technique for non-destructive chlorophyll estimation and distribution in leaves using hyperspectral imaging. The hyperspectral imaging data cube of cucumber (Cucumis sativus) leaves in the range of 450-850 nm was investigated and preprocessed. Sixty optical signatures or indices as a function of the associated reflectance (R-lambda) at the special wavelength (lambda) urn which proposed in the literatures were used to predict the total chlorophyll content in cucumber leaves. Finally, R-710/R-760 (R-780 - R-710)/(R-780 - R-680), (R-750 - R-705)/(R-750 + R-705), (R-680 - R-430)/(R-680 + R-430), R-860/(R-555 x R-708), (R695-705)(-1) - (R750-800)(-1). and REP-LEM (a index based on red edge position and estimated with h a linear extrapolation method) were identified as optimum indices. Red-edge waveband (680-780 nm) appeared in all these optimum indices, indicating the importance of REP (red edge position) in chlorophyll estimation. When (R695-705)(-1) - (R750-800)(-1), the best index was applied to an independent validation set, chlorophyll content (r = 0.8286) were reasonably well predicted, indicating model robustness. Depending on the sample, this technique enables to identify and characterize the relative content of various chlorophyll that distribution in the cucumber leaves. The map shows a relatively low level of chlorophyll at margins. Higher level can be noticed in the regions along the main veins and in some areas exhibiting dark green tissue. Our results indicate that hyperspectral imaging has considerable promise for predicting pigments in leaves and, the pigments can be detected in situ in living plant samples non-destructively.

J;Multispectral, Fluorescent and Photoplethysmographic Imaging for Remote Skin Assessment;Optical tissue imaging has several advantages over the routine clinical imaging methods, including non-invasiveness (it does not change the structure of tissues), remote operation (it avoids infections) and the ability to quantify the tissue condition by means of specific image parameters. Dermatologists and other skin experts need compact (preferably pocket-size), self-sustaining and easy-to-use imaging devices. The operational principles and designs of ten portable in-vivo skin imaging prototypes developed at the Biophotonics Laboratory of Institute of Atomic Physics and Spectroscopy, University of Latvia during the recent five years are presented in this paper. Four groups of imaging devices are considered. Multi-spectral imagers offer possibilities for distant mapping of specific skin parameters, thus facilitating better diagnostics of skin malformations. Autofluorescence intensity and photobleaching rate imagers show a promising potential for skin tumor identification and margin delineation. Photoplethysmography video-imagers ensure remote detection of cutaneous blood pulsations and can provide real-time information on cardiovascular parameters and anesthesia efficiency. Multimodal skin imagers perform several of the abovementioned functions by taking a number of spectral and video images with the same image sensor. Design details of the developed prototypes and results of clinical tests illustrating their functionality are presented and discussed.;2017;10.3390/s17051165
J;In vivo evaluation of melanoma thickness by multispectral imaging and an artificial neural network. A retrospective study on 250 cases of cutaneous melanoma;Aims and background: Noninvasive diagnostic methods such as dermoscopy, sonography, palpation or combined approaches have been developed in an attempt to preoperatively estimate melanoma thickness. However, the clinical presentation is often complex and the evaluation subjective. Multispectral image analysis of melanomas allows selection of features related to the content and distribution of absorbers, mainly melanin and hemoglobin, present within the lesion. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the same features might be useful to predict melanoma thickness. Methods: A multispectral image system was used to analyze in vivo 1939 pigmented skin lesions. The lesion selection was based on clinical and/or dermoscopic features that supported a suspicion for melanoma. All the lesions were then subjected to surgery for the histopathological diagnosis, and 250 were melanomas. From the multispectral images of the melanomas, we selected 12 features, seven of which were used to train and test an artificial neural network on 155 and 95 melanomas, respectively. Results: Sensitivity (i.e., melanoma >= 0.75 mm thick correctly classified) and specificity (i.e., melanoma < 0.75 mm thick correctly classified) evaluated from the receiving operating characteristic curves ranged from 76 to 90% and from 91 to 74%, respectively. Conclusions: Our approach provides results similar to those obtained with other methods and has the advantage that it is not related to the expertise of the clinician. In addition, the physical interpretation of the selected features suggests a possible role of spectrophotometry as an objective method to study the natural history of the early phases of the disease.;2007;
C;Toward in vivo diagnosis of skin cancer using multimode imaging dermoscopy: (II) Molecular mapping of highly pigmented lesions;We have developed a multimode imaging dermoscope that combines polarization and hyperspectral imaging with a computationally rapid analytical model. This approach employs specific spectral ranges of visible and near infrared wavelengths for mapping the distribution of specific skin bio-molecules. This corrects for the melanin-hemoglobin misestimation common to other systems, without resorting to complex and computationally intensive tissue optical models that are prone to inaccuracies due to over-modeling. Various human skin measurements including a melanocytic nevus, and venous occlusion conditions were investigated and compared with other ratiometric spectral imaging approaches. Access to the broad range of hyperspectral data in the visible and near-infrared range allows our algorithm to flexibly use different wavelength ranges for chromophore estimation while minimizing melanin-hemoglobin optical signature cross-talk.;2014;10.1117/12.2042182
J;Roles of linear and circular polarization properties and effect of wavelength choice on differentiation between ex vivo normal and cancerous gastric samples;Multispectral Mueller matrix imaging was performed over a spectral range from 470 to 632 nm on 4-mu m unstained gastric tissue sections. A complete set of polarization parameters was derived. The combination of linear depolarization and linear retardance yields the highest accuracy in sample classification. When the depolarization of linearly polarized light due to scattering is independent of the orientation angle of the incident linear polarization vector, the derivation of linear polarization properties will require only 3 x 3 Mueller matrix, which would significantly reduce the complexity of the polarimetry imaging system. When additional parameters are needed to complement the two linear polarization parameters, retardance, circular depolarization, and depolarization can be included in classification in the order of preference. However, these additional parameters would require the measurement of 4 x 4 Mueller matrix. In addition, it appears that wavelength is not a critical factor in terms of classification accuracy for thin tissue sections in this study.

J;Hyperspectral Multiplexed Biological Imaging of Nanoprobes Emitting in the Short-Wave Infrared Region;Optical bioimaging with exogenous luminophores emitting in short-wave infrared spectral region (SWIR, similar to 1000-1700 nm) is a rapidly developing field, and the development of multiple SWIR-photoluminescent nanoprobes has recently been reported. In this regard, hyperspectral imaging (HSI), combined with unmixing algorithms, is a promising tool that can allow for efficient multiplexing of the SWIR-emitting nanoagents by their photoluminescence (PL) spectral profiles. The SWIR HSI technique reported here is developed to multiplex two types of nanoprobes: polymeric nanoparticles doped with organic dye (PNPs) and rare-earth doped fluoride nanoparticles (RENPs). Both types of nanoprobes exhibit PL in the same spectral range (similar to 900-1200 nm), which hinders spectral separation of PL with optical filters and limits possibilities for their multiplexed imaging in biological tissues. By applying SWIR HSI, we exploited differences in the PL spectral profiles and achieved the spectrally selective and sensitive imaging of the PL signal from every type of nanoparticles. Unmixing of acquired data allowed for multiplexing of the spectrally overlapping nanoprobes by their PL profile. Both quantitative and spatial distribution for every type of nanoparticles were obtained from their mixed suspensions. Finally, the SWIR HSI technique with unmixing protocol was applied to in vivo imaging of mice subcutaneously injected with PNPs and RENPs. The applicability of hyperspectral techniques to multiplex nanoprobes in the in vivo imaging was successfully demonstrated.;2019;10.1186/s11671-019-3068-x
J;A hyperspectral method to assay the microphysiological fates of nanomaterials in histological samples;Nanoparticles are used extensively as biomedical imaging probes and potential therapeutic agents. As new particles are developed and tested in vivo, it is critical to characterize their biodistribution profiles. We demonstrate a new method that uses adaptive algorithms for the analysis of hyperspectral dark-field images to study the interactions between tissues and administered nanoparticles. This non-destructive technique quantitatively identifies particles in ex vivo tissue sections and enables detailed observations of accumulation patterns arising from organ specific clearance mechanisms, particle size, and the molecular specificity of nanoparticle surface coatings. Unlike nanoparticle uptake studies with electron microscopy, this method is tractable for imaging large fields of view. Adaptive hyperspectral image analysis achieves excellent detection sensitivity and specificity and is capable of identifying single nanoparticles. Using this method, we collected the first data on the sub-organ distribution of several types of gold nanoparticles in mice and observed localization patterns in tumors.;2016;10.7554/eLife.16352
C;Raman hyperspectral imaging of different salivary gland cell types for tissue engineering;Regenerative medicine encompasses the rebuilding or repairing of organs. We are developing bioengineered organoids that will differentiate when implanted in vivo to partially restore organ function. These complex organoids, derived from embryonic salivary gland cells, include both primary mesenchyme and epithelial progenitor cells. Noninvasive quality monitoring of tissue-engineered constructs is required before implantation of bioengineered constructs in vivo. Raman spectroscopy offers fast, simple, and, most importantly, non-invasive quantitative cell and tissue analysis that does not require elaborate sample preparation. We demonstrate the application of Raman micro-spectroscopy technique to in vitro monitoring of cell types within 3D cell clusters, with the ultimate goal of applying this technology in situ to monitor adult cell-derived organoids that are implanted in vivo. We have collected Raman spectra of epithelial and mesenchymal progenitor cells in vitro, and have shown that we are able to identify different Raman signatures corresponding to each cell type. In particular, we have observed Raman spectral differences which correspond to the C-C and C-N stretch in proteins, as well as in the Amide I and III envelopes. The embryonic mesenchyme cells are similar to mesenchymal stem cells, MSCs, which can differentiate into bone, cartilage, and other cell types. In addition to salivary gland tissue engineering applications, mesenchymal cells offer a great potential in repairing bone, cartilage, and damaged heart cells, and to treat inflammation and immune system diseases. In future studies, our Raman spectroscopy methods can be broadly applied to monitoring of organoids for application in many diseases.;2019;10.1117/12.2511396
J;Advances in optical imaging for pharmacological studies;Imaging approaches are an essential tool for following up over time representative parameters of in vivo models, providing useful information in pharmacological studies. Main advantages of optical imaging approaches compared to other imaging methods are their safety, straight-forward use and cost-effectiveness. A main drawback, however, is having to deal with the presence of high scattering and high absorption in living tissues. Depending on how these issues are addressed, three different modalities can be differentiated: planar imaging (including fluorescence and bioluminescence in vivo imaging), optical tomography, and optoacoustic approaches. In this review we describe the latest advances in optical in vivo imaging with pharmacological applications, with special focus on the development of new optical imaging probes in order to overcome the strong absorption introduced by different tissue components, especially hemoglobin, and the development of multimodal imaging systems in order to overcome the resolution limitations imposed by scattering.;2015;10.3389/fphar.2015.00189
J;Spatial mapping of drug delivery to brain tissue using hyperspectral spatial frequency-domain imaging;We present an application of spatial frequency-domain imaging (SFDI) to the wide-field imaging of drug delivery to brain tissue. Measurements were compared with values obtained by a previously validated variation of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, the method of optical pharmacokinetics (OP). We demonstrate a cross-correlation between the two methods for absorption extraction and drug concentration determination in both experimental tissue phantoms and freshly extracted rodent brain tissue. These methods were first used to assess intra-arterial (IA) delivery of cationic liposomes to brain tissue in Sprague Dawley rats under transient cerebral hypoperfusion. Results were found to be in agreement with previously published experimental data and pharmacokinetic models of IA drug delivery. We then applied the same scheme to evaluate IA mitoxantrone delivery to glioma-bearing rats. Good correlation was seen between OP and SFDI determined concentrations taken from normal and tumor averaged sites. This study shows the feasibility of mapping drug/tracer distributions and encourages the use of SFDI for spatial imaging of tissues for drug/tracer-tagged carrier deposition and pharmacokinetic studies.

J;Assessment of advanced glycated end product accumulation in skin using auto fluorescence multispectral imaging;Several studies have shown that advanced glycation end products (AGE) play a role in both the micro vascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes and are closely linked to inflammation and atherosclerosis. AGEs accumulate in skin and can be detected using their auto fluorescence (AF). A significant correlation exists between AGE AF and the levels of AGEs as obtained from skin biopsies. A commercial device, the AGE Reader, has become available to assess skin AF for clinical purposes but, while displaying promising results, it is limited to single-point measurements performed in contact to skin tissue. Furthermore, in vivo imaging of AGE accumulation is virtually unexplored. We proposed a non-invasive, contact-less novel technique for quantifying fluorescent AGE deposits in skin tissue using a multispectral imaging camera setup (MSI) during ultraviolet (UV) exposure. Imaging involved applying a region-of-interest mask, avoiding specular reflections and a simple calibration. Results of a study conducted on 16 subjects with skin types ranging from fair to deeply pigmented skin, showed that AGE measured with MSI in forearm skin was significantly correlated with the AGE reference method (AGE Reader on forearm skin, R=0.68, p=0.005). AGE measured in facial skin was borderline significantly related to AGE Reader on forearm skin (R=0.47, p=0.078). These results support the use of the technique in devices for non-touch measurement of AGE content in either facial or forearm skin tissue over time. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

C;A calibrated tissue phantom for small animal fluorescence imaging - art. no. 68700C;Tissue phantoms have been in use for decades in the quality control and calibration of x-ray, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography. Such phantoms are necessary in clinical imaging, insuring the accuracy and calibration of acquired images and allowing for artifact correction. In addition, phantoms allow image comparison and/or registration between multiple instruments at different clinics and temporal comparison of the same animal. Recently, optical tissue phantoms have received much attention as it has become apparent that optical imagers pose many of the same requirements for quality control and calibration as clinical imagers. Small animal fluorescence imaging is a rapidly growing field that could benefit greatly from the implementation of a standardized reference phantom. We present our results in developing optical tissue phantoms for quality control and calibration of small animal fluorescence imagers. To accurately simulate in vivo imaging conditions, the phantom provides absorption, scatter, and fluorescence information, in known amounts and varying with spatial distribution. This allows us to monitor day-to-day variability and system response as a function of different optical path components in hyperspectral imaging technologies for small animal fluorescence imaging. The phantom has also enabled us to assess the actual, or practical, sensitivity of a small animal fluorescence imager in terms of imaging a dye concentration through an equivalent tissue depth. By combining an understanding of system response with theoretical optical raytrace modeling, this calibration tool can be applied to the majority of small animal fluorescence imagers currently in production.;2008;10.1117/12.763125
J;Combined optical coherence tomography and hyperspectral imaging using a double-clad fiber coupler;This work demonstrates the combination of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) using a double-clad optical fiber coupler. The single-mode core of the fiber is used for OCT imaging, while the inner cladding of the double-clad fiber provides an efficient way to capture the reflectance spectrum of the sample. The combination of both methods enables three-dimensional acquisition of the sample morphology with OCT, enhanced with complementary molecular information contained in the hyperspectral image. The HSI data can be used to highlight the presence of specific molecules with characteristic absorption peaks or to produce true color images overlaid on the OCT volume for improved tissue identification by the clinician. Such a system could be implemented in a number of clinical endoscopic applications and could improve the current practice in tissue characterization, diagnosis, and surgical guidance.

J;VEGF-Targeted Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography and Fluorescence Molecular Imaging in Human Carotid Atherosclerotic Plaques;Vulnerable atherosclerotic carotid plaques are prone to rupture, resulting in ischemic strokes. In contrast to radiological imaging techniques, molecular imaging techniques have the potential to assess plaque vulnerability by visualizing diseases-specific biomarkers. A risk factor for rupture is intra-plaque neovascularization, which is characterized by overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). Here, we study if administration of bevacizumab-800CW, a near-infrared tracer targeting VEGF-A, is safe and if molecular assessment of atherosclerotic carotid plaques in vivo is possible using multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT). Healthy volunteers and patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis scheduled for carotid artery endarterectomy were imaged with MSOT. Secondly, patients were imaged two days after intravenous administration of 4.5 bevacizumab-800CW. Ex vivo fluorescence molecular imaging of the surgically removed plaque specimen was performed and correlated with histopathology. In this first-in-human MSOT and fluorescence molecular imaging study, we show that administration of 4.5 mg bevacizumab-800CW appeared to be safe in five patients and accumulated in the carotid atherosclerotic plaque. Although we could visualize the carotid bifurcation area in all subjects using MSOT, bevacizumab-800CW-resolved signal could not be detected with MSOT in the patients. Future studies should evaluate tracer safety, higher doses of bevacizumab-800CW or develop dedicated contrast agents for carotid atherosclerotic plaque assessment using MSOT.;2021;10.3390/diagnostics11071227
J;Noninvasive monitoring of liver metastasis development via combined multispectral photoacoustic imaging and fluorescence diffuse optical tomography;Rationale: In vivo molecular imaging in preclinical animal models is a tool of choice for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in cancer development and for conducting drug development research. Moreover, combining several imaging modalities can provide multifaceted, complementary and cross-validated information. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a promising imaging modality that can reflect blood vasculature and tissue oxygenation as well as detect exogenous molecules, but one shortcoming of PAI is a lack of organic photoacoustic contrast agents capable of providing tumor contrast. Methods: In the present study, we designed an animal model of liver metastases from colon cancer and monitored metastasis development by in vivo bioluminescence and X-ray microcomputed tomography. Contrast-agent-free PAI was used to detect the respective amounts of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin and, thus, liver tissue oxygenation. two contrast agents, Angiostamp800 and indocyanin green (ICG), respectively with and without tumor targeting specificity, were then evaluated for their dual fluorescence and photoacoustic detectability and were then used for combined PAI and fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (fDOT) at various disease development stages. Findings: Contrast-agent-free PAI reflected tumor angiogenesis and gradual hypoxia during metastasis development. Multispectral PAI enabled noninvasive real-time monitoring of ICG blood pharmacokinetics, which demonstrated tumor-related liver dysfunction. Both PAI and fluorescence ICG signals were clearly modified in metastasis-bearing livers but did not allow for differentiation between different disease stages. In contrast, there was a significant improvement achieved by using the tumor-specific marker Angiostamp800, which provided gradually increasing PAI and fDOT signals during metastasis development. Conclusion: We demonstrated for the first time the value of using Angiostamp800 as a bimodal tumor-targeting contrast agent for combined PAI and fluorescence imaging of liver metastasis progression in vivo.;2020;10.7150/ijbs.40896
J;Intraoperative colon perfusion assessment using multispectral imaging;In colorectal surgery an anastomosis performed using poorly-perfused, ischacmic bowel segments may result in a leak and consequent morbidity. Traditional measures of perfusion assessment rely on clinical judgement and are mainly subjective, based on tissue appearance, leading to variability between clinicians. This paper describes a multispectral imaging (MSI) laparoscope that can derive quantitative measures of tissue oxygen saturation (SO2). The system uses a xenon surgical light source and fast filter wheel camera to capture eight narrow waveband images across the visible range in approximately 0.3 s. Spectral validation measurements were performed by imaging standardised colour tiles and comparing reflectance with ground truth spectrometer data. Tissue spectra were decomposed into individual contributions from haemoglobin, adipose tissue and scattering, using a previously-developed regression approach. Initial clinical results from seven patients undergoing colorectal surgery are presented and used to characterise measurement stability and reproducibility in vivo. Strategies to improve signal-to-noise ratio and correct for motion are described. Images of healthy bowel tissue (in vivo) indicate that baseline SO2 is approximately 75 t 6%. The SO2 profile along a bowel segment following ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) shows a decrease from the proximal to distal end. In the clinical cases shown, imaging results concurred with clinical judgements of the location of well-perfused tissue. Adipose tissue, visibly yellow in the RGB images, is shown to surround the mesentery and cover some of the serosa. SO2 in this tissue is consistently high, with mean value of 90%. These results show that MSI is a potential intraoperative guidance tool for assessment of perfusion. Mapping of SO2 in the colon could be used by surgeons to guide choice of transection points and ensure that well-perfused tissue is used to form an anastomosis. The observation of high mesenteric SO2 agrees with work in the literature and warrants further exploration. Larger studies incorporating with a wider cohort of clinicians will help to provide retrospective evidence of how this imaging technique may be able to reduce inter-operator variability.

J;Multispectral Interlaced Sparse Sampling Photoacoustic Tomography;"Multispectral photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is capable of resolving tissue chromophore distribution based on spectral un-mixing. It works by identifying the absorption spectrum variations from a sequence of photoacoustic images acquired at multiple illumination wavelengths. Due to multispectral acquisition, this inevitably creates a large dataset. To cut down the data volume, sparse sampling methods that reduce the number of detectors have been developed. However, image reconstruction of sparse sampling PAT is challenging because of insufficient angular coverage. During spectral un-mixing, these inaccurate reconstructions will further amplify imaging artefacts and contaminate the results. To solve this problem, we present the interlaced sparse sampling (ISS) PAT, a method that involved: 1) a novel scanning-based image acquisition scheme in which the sparse detector array rotates while switching illumination wavelength, such that a dense angular coverage could be achieved by using only a few detectors; and 2) a corresponding image reconstruction algorithm that makes use of an anatomical prior image created from the ISS strategy to guide PAT image computation. Reconstructed from the signals acquired at different wavelengths (angles), this self-generated prior image fuses multispectral and angular information, and thus has rich anatomical features and minimum artefacts. A specialized iterative imaging model that effectively incorporates this anatomical prior image into the reconstruction process is also developed. Simulation, phantom, and in vivo animal experiments showed that even under 1/6 or 1/8 sparse sampling rate, our method achieved comparable image reconstruction and spectral un-mixing results to those obtained by conventional dense sampling method.";2020;10.1109/TMI.2020.2996240
J;Multispectral quantitative photoacoustic imaging of osteoarthritis in finger joints;We present in vivo experimental evidence that multispectral quantitative photoacoustic tomography (qPAT) has the potential to detect osteoarthritis (OA) in the finger joints. In this pilot study, two OA patients and three healthy volunteers were enrolled, and their distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints were examined photoacoustically by a multispectral PAT scanner. Images of tissue physiological/functional parameters including oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, oxygen saturation, and water content, along with the tissue acoustic velocity of all the examined joints, were simultaneously recovered using a finite element reconstruction algorithm for multispectral photoacoustic measurements. The recovered multispectral photoacoustic images show that the OA joints have significantly elevated water content, decreased oxygen saturation, and increased acoustic velocity compared to the normal joints.

J;Multispectral Photoacoustic Imaging Artifact Removal and Denoising Using Time Series Model-Based Spectral Noise Estimation;The aim of this study is to solve a problem of denoising and artifact removal from in vivo multispectral photoacoustic imaging when the level of noise is not known a priori. The study analyzes Wiener filtering in Fourier domain when a family of anisotropic shape filters is considered. The unknown noise and signal power spectral densities are estimated using spectral information of images and the autoregressive of the power 1 (AR(1)) model. Edge preservation is achieved by detecting image edges in the original and the denoised image and superimposing a weighted contribution of the two edge images to the resulting denoised image. The method is tested on multispectral photoacoustic images from simulations, a tissue-mimicking phantom, as well as in vivo imaging of the mouse, with its performance compared against that of the standard Wiener filtering in Fourier domain. The results reveal better denoising and fine details preservation capabilities of the proposed method when compared to that of the standard Wiener filtering in Fourier domain, suggesting that this could be a useful denoising technique for other multispectral photoacoustic studies.;2016;10.1109/TMI.2016.2550624
C;Video-rate dual polarization multispectral endoscopic imaging;Cancerous and precancerous growths often exhibit changes in scattering, and therefore depolarization, as well as collagen breakdown, causing changes in birefringent effects. Simple difference of linear polarization imaging is unable to represent anisotropic effects like birefringence, and Mueller polarimetry is time-consuming and difficult to implement clinically. This work presents a dual-polarization endoscope to collect co-and cross-polarized images for each of two polarization states, and further incorporates narrow band detection to increase vascular contrast, particularly vascular remodeling present in diseased tissue, and provide depth sensitivity. The endoscope was shown to be sensitive to both isotropic and anisotropic materials in phantom and in vivo experiments.;2015;10.1117/12.2079726
J;QUANTIFYING NANOPARTICLE TRANSPORT IN VIVO USING HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGING WITH A DORSAL SKINFOLD WINDOW CHAMBER;We have developed a noninvasive imaging method to quantify in vivo drug delivery pharmacokinetics without the need for blood or tissue collection to determine drug concentration. By combining the techniques of hyperspectral imaging and a dorsal skinfold window chamber, this method enabled the real-time monitoring of vascular transport and tissue deposition of nanoparticles labeled with near-infrared (NIR) dye. Using this imaging method, we quantified the delivery pharmacokinetics of the native high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted HDL nanoparticles and demonstrated these HDLs had long circulation time in blood stream (half-life >12 h). These HDL nanoparticles could efficiently carry cargo DiR-BOA to extravasate from blood vessels, diffuse through extracellular matrix, and penetrate and be retained in the tumor site. The EGFR targeting specificity of EGFR-targeted HDL (EGFR-specific peptide conjugated HDL) was also visualized in vivo by competitive inhibition with excess EGFR-specific peptide. In summary, this imaging technology may help point the way toward the development of novel imaging-based pharmacokinetic assays for preclinical drugs and evaluation of drug delivery efficiency, providing a dynamic window into the development and application of novel drug delivery systems.;2012;10.1142/S179354581250023X
J;Optical coherence hyperspectral microscopy with a single supercontinuum light source;In the paper, we have developed an optical coherence hyperspectral microscopy with a single supercontinuum light source. The microscopy consists of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI), which can visualize the structural and functional characteristics of biological tissues. The 500 to 700 nm band is selected for HSI and OCT imaging, where HSI enables imaging of oxygen saturation and hemoglobin (Hb) content, while OCT acquires structural characteristics to assess the morphology of biological tissues. The system performance of the optical coherence hyperspectral microscopy is verified by normal mice ears, and the practical applications of the microscopy is further performed in 4T1 and inflammation Balb/c mice ears in vivo. The experimental results demonstrate that the microscopy has potential to provide complementary information for clinical applications.;2021;10.1002/jbio.202000491
J;Detection of Head and Neck Cancer in Surgical Specimens Using Quantitative Hyperspectral Imaging;Purpose: This study intends to investigate the feasibility of using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to detect and delineate cancers in fresh, surgical specimens of patients with head and neck cancers. Experimental Design: A clinical study was conducted in order to collect and image fresh, surgical specimens from patients (N = 36) with head and neck cancers undergoing surgical resection. A set of machine-learning tools were developed to quantify hyperspectral images of the resected tissue in order to detect and delineate cancerous regions which were validated by histopathologic diagnosis. More than two million reflectance spectral signatures were obtained by HSI and analyzed using machine-learning methods. The detection results of HSI were compared with autofluorescence imaging and fluorescence imaging of two vital-dyes of the same specimens. Results: Quantitative HSI differentiated cancerous tissue from normal tissue in ex vivo surgical specimens with a sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 91%, respectively, and which was more accurate than autofluorescence imaging (P < 0.05) or fluorescence imaging of 2-NBDG (P < 0.05) and proflavine (P < 0.05). The proposed quantification tools also generated cancer probability maps with the tumor border demarcated and which could provide real-time guidance for surgeons regarding optimal tumor resection. Conclusions: This study highlights the feasibility of using quantitative HSI as a diagnostic tool to delineate the cancer boundaries in surgical specimens, and which could be translated into the clinic application with the hope of improving clinical outcomes in the future.

J;Motion clustering for deblurring multispectral optoacoustic tomography images of the mouse heart;Cardiac imaging in small animals is a valuable tool in basic biological research and drug discovery for cardiovascular disease. Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) represents an emerging imaging modality capable of visualizing specific tissue chromophores at high resolution and deep in tissues in vivo by separating their spectral signatures. Whereas single-wavelength images can be acquired by multielement ultrasound detection in real-time imaging, using multiple wavelengths at separate times can lead to image blurring due to motion during acquisition. Therefore, MSOT imaging of the heart results in degraded resolution because of the heartbeat. In this work, we applied a clustering algorithm, k-means, to automatically separate a sequence of single-pulse images at multiple excitation wavelengths into clusters corresponding to different stages of the cardiac cycle. We then performed spectral unmixing on each cluster to obtain images of tissue intrinsic chromophores at different cardiac stages, showing reduced sensitivity to motion compared to signal averaging without clustering. We found that myocardium images of improved resolution and contrast can be achieved using MSOT motion clustering correction. The correction method presented could be generally applied to other MSOT imaging applications prone to motion artifacts, for example, by respiration and heartbeat.

J;Towards real-time multispectral endoscopic imaging for cardiac lesion quality assessment;Atrial fibrillation (Afib) can lead to life threatening conditions such as heart failure and stroke. During Afib treatment, clinicians aim to repress unusual electrical activity by electrically isolating the pulmonary veins (PV) from the left atrium (LA) using radiofrequency ablation. However, current clinical tools are limited in reliably assessing transmurality of the ablation lesions and detecting the presence of gaps within ablation lines, which can warrant repeat procedures. In this study, we developed an endoscopic multispectral reflectance imaging (eMSI) system for enhanced discrimination of tissue treatment at the PV junction. The system enables direct visualization of cardiac lesions through an endoscope at acquisition rates up to 25 Hz. Five narrowband, high-power LEDs were used to illuminate the sample (450, 530, 625, 810 and 940nm) and combinatory parameters were calculated based on their relative reflectance. A stitching algorithm was employed to generate large field-of-view, multispectral mosaics of the ablated PV junction from individual eMSI images. A total of 79 lesions from 15 swine hearts were imaged, ex vivo. Statistical analysis of the acquired five spectral data sets and ratiometric maps revealed significant differences between transmural lesions, non-transmural lesions around the venoatrial junctions, unablated posterior wall of left atrium tissue, and pulmonary vein (p < 0.0001). A pixel-based quadratic discriminant analysis classifier was applied to distinguish four tissue types: PV, untreated LA, non-transmural and transmural lesions. We demonstrate tissue type classification accuracies of 80.2% and 92.1% for non-transmural and transmural lesions, and 95.0% and 92.8% for PV and untreated LA sites, respectively. These findings showcase the potential of eMS1 for lesion validation and may help to improve AFib treatment efficacy.

J;Fast multispectral diffuse optical tomography system for in vivo three-dimensional imaging of seizure dynamics;We describe a multispectral continuous-wave diffuse optical tomography (DOT) system that can be used for in vivo three-dimensional (3-D) imaging of seizure dynamics. Fast 3-D data acquisition is realized through a time multiplexing approach based on a parallel lighting configuration-our system can achieve 0.12 ms per source per wavelength and up to a 14 Hz sampling rate for a full set of data for 3-D DOT image reconstruction. The system is validated using both static and dynamic tissue-like phantoms. An initial in vivo experiment using a rat model of seizure is also demonstrated.

J;Longitudinal In Vivo Imaging to Assess Blood Flow and Oxygenation in Implantable Engineered Tissues;The functionality of vascular networks within implanted prevascularized tissues is difficult to assess using traditional analysis techniques, such as histology. This is largely due to the inability to visualize hemodynamics in vivo longitudinally. Therefore, we have developed dynamic imaging methods to measure blood flow and hemoglobin oxygen saturation in implanted prevascularized tissues noninvasively and longitudinally. Using laser speckle imaging, multispectral imaging, and intravital microscopy, we demonstrate that fibrin-based tissue implants anastomose with the host (severe combined immunodeficient mice) in as short as 20 h. Anastomosis results in initial perfusion with highly oxygenated blood, and an increase in average hemoglobin oxygenation of 53%. However, shear rates in the preformed vessels were low (20.8 +/- 12.8 s(-1)), and flow did not persist in the vast majority of preformed vessels due to thrombus formation. These findings suggest that designing an appropriate vascular network structure in prevascularized tissues to maintain shear rates above the threshold for thrombosis may be necessary to maintain flow following implantation. We conclude that wide-field and microscopic functional imaging can dynamically assess blood flow and oxygenation in vivo in prevascularized tissues, and can be used to rapidly evaluate and improve prevascularization strategies.;2012;10.1089/ten.tec.2011.0744
J;Multispectral snapshot imaging of skin microcirculatory hemoglobin oxygen saturation using artificial neural networks trained on in vivo data;Significance: Developing algorithms for estimating blood oxygenation from snapshot multi-spectral imaging (MSI) data is challenging due to the complexity of sensor characteristics and photon transport modeling in tissue. We circumvent this using a method where artificial neural networks (ANNs) are trained on in vivo MSI data with target values from a point-measuring reference method. Aim: To develop and evaluate a methodology where a snapshot filter mosaic camera is utilized for imaging skin hemoglobin oxygen saturation (S-O2), using ANNs. Approach: MSI data were acquired during occlusion provocations. ANNs were trained to estimate S-O2 with MSI data as input, targeting data from a validated probe-based reference system. Performance of ANNs with different properties and training data sets was compared. Results: The method enables spatially resolved estimation of skin tissue S-O2. Results are comparable to those acquired using a Monte-Carlo-based approach when relevant training data are used. Conclusions: Training an ANN on in vivo MSI data covering a wide range of target values acquired during an occlusion protocol enable real-time estimation of S-O2 maps. Data from the probe-based reference system can be used as target despite differences in sampling depth and measurement position. (C) The Authors.

J;A compact hyperspectral camera for measurement of perfusion parameters in medicine;Worldwide, chronic wounds are still a major and increasing problem area in medicine with protracted suffering of patients and enormous costs. Beside conventional wound treatment, for instance kinds of oxygen therapy and cold plasma technology have been tested, providing an improvement in the perfusion of wounds and their healing potential, but these methods are unfortunately not sufficiently validated and accepted for clinical practice to date. Using hyperspectral imaging technology in the visible (VIS) and near infrared (NIR) region with high spectral and spatial resolution, perfusion parameters of tissue and wounds can be determined. We present a new compact hyperspectral camera which can be used in clinical practice. From hyperspectral data the hemoglobin oxygenation (StO(2)), the relative concentration of hemoglobin [tissue hemoglobin index (THI)] and the so-called NIR-perfusion index can be determined. The first two parameters are calculated from the VIS-part of the spectrum and represent the perfusion of superficial tissue layers, whereas the NIR-perfusion index is calculated from the NIR-part representing the perfusion in deeper layers. First clinical measurements of transplanted flaps and chronic ulcer wounds show, that the perfusion level can be determined quantitatively allowing sensitive evaluation and monitoring for an optimization of the wound treatment planning and for validation of new treatment methods.;2018;10.1515/bmt-2017-0145
J;Fluorescence- and multispectral optoacoustic imaging for an optimized detection of deeply located tumors in an orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic carcinoma;"A crucial point for the management of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the decrease of R1 resections. Our aim was to evaluate the combination of multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) with fluorescence guided surgery (FGS) for diagnosis and perioperative detection of tumor nodules and resection margins in a xenotransplant mouse model of human pancreatic cancer. The peptide cRGD, conjugated with the near infrared fluorescent (NIRF) dye IRDye800CW and with a trans-cyclooctene (TCO) tag for future click chemistry (cRGD-800CW-TCO), was applied to PDAC bearing immunodeficient nude mice; 27 days after orthotopic transplantation of human AsPC-1 cells into the head of the pancreas, mice were injected with cRGD-800CW-TCO and imaged with fluorescence- and optoacoustic devices before and 2, 6 and 24 hr after injection, before they were sacrificed and dissected with a guidance of FGS imaging system. Fluorescence imaging of cRGD-800CW-TCO allowed detection of the tumor area but without information about the depth, whereas MSOT allowed high resolution 3 D identification of the tumor area, in particular of small tumor nodules. Highly sensitive delineation of tumor burden was achieved during FGS in all mice. Imaging of whole-mouse cryosections, histopathological analysis and NIRF microscopy confirmed the localization of cRGD-800CW-TCO within the tumor tissue. In principle, all imaging modalities applied here were able to detect PDAC in vivo. However, the combination of MSOT and FGS provided detailed spatial information of the signal and achieved a complete overview of the distribution and localization of cRGD-800CW-TCO within the tumor before and during surgical intervention.";2018;10.1002/ijc.31236
J;Photoacoustic Imaging in Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine;"Several imaging modalities are available for investigation of the morphological, functional, and molecular features of engineered tissues in small animal models. While research in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM) would benefit from a comprehensive longitudinal analysis of new strategies, researchers have not always applied the most advanced methods. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a rapidly emerging modality that has received significant attention due to its ability to exploit the strong endogenous contrast of optical methods with the high spatial resolution of ultrasound methods. Exogenous contrast agents can also be used in PAI for targeted imaging. Applications of PAI relevant to TERM include stem cell tracking, longitudinal monitoring of scaffolds in vivo, and evaluation of vascularization. In addition, the emerging capabilities of PAI applied to the detection and monitoring of cancer and other inflammatory diseases could be exploited by tissue engineers. This article provides an overview of the operating principles of PAI and its broad potential for application in TERM. Impact statement Photoacoustic imaging, a new hybrid imaging technique, has demonstrated high potential in the clinical diagnostic applications. The optical and acoustic aspect of the photoacoustic imaging system works in harmony to provide better resolution at greater tissue depth. Label-free imaging of vasculature with this imaging can be used to track and monitor disease, as well as the therapeutic progression of treatment. Photoacoustic imaging has been utilized in tissue engineering to some extent; however, the full benefit of this technique is yet to be explored. The increasing availability of commercial photoacoustic systems will make application as an imaging tool for tissue engineering application more feasible. This review first provides a brief description of photoacoustic imaging and summarizes its current and potential application in tissue engineering.";2020;10.1089/ten.teb.2019.0296
J;Separating melanin from hemodynamics in nevi using multimode hyperspectral dermoscopy and spatial frequency domain spectroscopy;Changes in the pattern and distribution of both melanocytes (pigment producing) and vasculature (hemoglobin containing) are important in distinguishing melanocytic proliferations. The ability to accurately measure melanin distribution at different depths and to distinguish it from hemoglobin is clearly important when assessing pigmented lesions (benign versus malignant). We have developed a multimode hyperspectral dermoscope (SkinSpect (TM)) able to more accurately image both melanin and hemoglobin distribution in skin. SkinSpect uses both hyperspectral and polarization-sensitive measurements. SkinSpect's higher accuracy has been obtained by correcting for the effect of melanin absorption on hemoglobin absorption in measurements of melanocytic nevi. In vivo human skin pigmented nevi (N = 20) were evaluated with the SkinSpect, and measured melanin and hemoglobin concentrations were compared with spatial frequency domain spectroscopy (SFDS) measurements. We confirm that both systems show low correlation of hemoglobin concentrations with regions containing different melanin concentrations (R = 0.13 for SFDS, R = 0.07 for SkinSpect).

J;Hyperspectral in vivo analysis of normal skin chromophores and visualization of oncological pathologies;In the paper, we present test results of methods for the noninvasive diagnosis of skin neoplasms, based on the hyperspectral registration of images by using a camera with an acousto-optic tunable filter. For the identification of oncological pathologies, an integral spectral index has been proposed for a set of concentric regions around the source of neoplasm growth for the tissue sample under study. As well as taking account of changes in the spectral properties of the tissue, the introduced index indirectly takes into account classical ABCD dermatoscopic features: asymmetry, border irregularity, color diversity, and the tumor diameter. Results of training set separating are presented and the applicability of the proposed approaches to the clinical practice is shown.;2019;10.18287/2412-6179-2019-43-4-661-670
C;Can Hyperspectral Images be used to detect Brain tumor pixels and their malignant phenotypes?;"Neurosurgeons encounter a number of difficulties during brain tumor resection, even when using advanced imaging techniques. The most important are: excessive extraction of normal (healthy) tissue, and inadvertently leaving small sections of tumor tissue un-resected. This study attempts to help neurosurgeons to accurately determine brain tumor boundaries in the resection process using hyperspectral images. We design real-time classification algorithms to determine the type of tissue located at each pixel using technology that could be made accessible to most hospitals. The pixel classifier function is personalized for each of the 13 in-vivo and in-vitro glioblastoma samples by training in situ working with a region of pixels selected for each label. At a certain point during the resection, the surgeon selects a small area of tumor and healthy tissue from the RGB image and our mathematical model provides the classification map for the full image. We also suggest a personalized separator function for each label in order to find cell families with the hyperspectral signature. Mean intra-patient sensitivity was 89% and 85% for in-vivo and in-vitro samples respectively; however, mean specificity was 96% and 92% respectively. Our model allows the spatial detection of different tumor (or healthy) clones that could be related to phenotype heterogeneity within the brain. We find different vasculature and tumor families within patients which might be related to tumor invasion of the vasculature, and different degrees of tumor malignancy, respectively.";2020;
J;Quantitative optical imaging of vascular response in vivo in a model of peripheral arterial disease;The mouse hind limb ischemia (HLI) model is well established for studying collateral vessel formation and testing therapies for peripheral arterial disease, but there is a lack of quantitative techniques for intravitally analyzing blood vessel structure and function. To address this need, non-invasive, quantitative optical imaging techniques were developed to assess the time-course of recovery in the mouse HLI model. Hyperspectral imaging and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were used to non-invasively image hemoglobin oxygen saturation and microvessel morphology plus blood flow, respectively, in the anesthetized mouse after induction of HLI. Hyperspectral imaging detected significant increases in hemoglobin saturation in the ischemic paw as early as 3 days after femoral artery ligation (P < 0.01), and significant increases in distal blood flow were first detected with OCT 14 days postsurgery (P < 0.01). Intravital OCT images of the adductor muscle vasculature revealed corkscrew collateral vessels characteristic of the arteriogenic response to HLI. The hyperspectral imaging and OCT data significantly correlated with each other and with laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) and tissue oxygenation sensor data (P < 0.01). However, OCT measurements acquired depth-resolved information and revealed more sustained flow deficits following surgery that may be masked by more superficial measurements (LDPI, hyperspectral imaging). Therefore, intravital OCT may provide a robust biomarker for the late stages of ischemic limb recovery. This work validates non-invasive acquisition of both functional and morphological data with hyperspectral imaging and OCT. Together, these techniques provide cardiovascular researchers an unprecedented and comprehensive view of the temporal dynamics of HLI recovery in living mice.;2013;10.1152/ajpheart.00362.2013
C;Nonlinear unmixing to account for blood absorption in multispectral imaging for improved quantification of intracellular and extracellular EGFR;Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) have high levels of chromosomal instability and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression, both of which drive their tumorigenesis. While drug treatment targeting the extracellular domain of EGFR has shown some success, mutations and alternate intracellular pathways contribute to therapeutic resistance. Therefore, a dynamic in vivo method to monitor binding and downstream cell signaling is warranted. Previous work has demonstrated that paired-agent imaging (PAI) is a powerful tool to quantify extracellular EGFR, and so this work extends the same principles to quantify intracellular protein target engagement. Here, in ovo models were used to grow human HNSCC xenografts - eggs were windowed to reveal the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of chicken embryos and tumors were implanted on its surface. A fluorescent cocktail of both intracellular and extracellular, targeted and untargeted agents (four agents total) was intravenously injected and multispectral imaging was performed over two hours. To isolate the relative quantities of each agent, a spectral fitting procedure was employed that accounted for the linear contributions of each fluorescent agent and autofluorescence, and the non-linear absorbing contributions of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin. This unmixing was performed on a pixel-by-pixel basis to generate distribution maps of each individual dye, and then motion correction was done, followed by a convolution correction to account for delivery differences. Results demonstrated successful unmixing of individual fluorophores such that a ratiometric calculation could be applied to extract both intracellular and extracellular binding potential (BP), which is proportional to EGFR concentration.;2022;10.1117/12.2609773
J;Distinction of surgically resected gastrointestinal stromal tumor by near-infrared hyperspectral imaging;The diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) using conventional endoscopy is difficult because submucosal tumor (SMT) lesions like GIST are covered by a mucosal layer. Near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) can obtain optical information from deep inside tissues. However, far less progress has been made in the development of techniques for distinguishing deep lesions like GIST. This study aimed to investigate whether NIR-HSI is suitable for distinguishing deep SMT lesions. In this study, 12 gastric GIST lesions were surgically resected and imaged with an NIR hyperspectral camera from the aspect of the mucosal surface. Thus, the images were obtained ex-vivo. The site of the GIST was defined by a pathologist using the NIR image to prepare training data for normal and GIST regions. A machine learning algorithm, support vector machine, was then used to predict normal and GIST regions. Results were displayed using color-coded regions. Although 7 specimens had a mucosal layer (thickness 0.4-2.5 mm) covering the GIST lesion, NIR-HSI analysis by machine learning showed normal and GIST regions as color-coded areas. The specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of the results were 73.0%, 91.3%, and 86.1%, respectively. The study suggests that NIR-HSI analysis may potentially help distinguish deep lesions.;2020;10.1038/s41598-020-79021-7
C;A Novel Gold Nanoparticles Drug Delivery System: Design and Ex Vivo Tissue Testing;In the present work we have designed a novel gold nanoparticle (GNP) based nanodrug delivery system, which has been loaded with a naturally occurring anticancer molecule, curcumin. GNPs were selected as drug carrier due to their unique properties including high surface area, small size, inertness, low toxicity and high stability. The drug delivery system was synthesized by a green, one pot method which involved simple mixing of reactants, with no heating or toxic chemicals. Additionally, GNPs also display intrinsic anti-cancer attributes on their own, which is expected to further amplify the anticancer effect of the system. Curcumin release was activated by a hand-held low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) device. It is hypothesized that the moderate rise in tissue temperature (up to 43 degrees C) together with mechanical effects of LIPUS beam induces effective release of curcumin from the surface of GNP. The developed nanodrug delivery system was characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, fluorescence and hyperspectral imaging.;2020;
J;Reliable Cell Segmentation Based on Spectral Phasor Analysis of Hyperspectral Stimulated Raman Scattering Imaging Data;Hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) imaging has rapidly become an emerging tool for high content analyses of cell and tissue systems. The label-free nature of SRS imaging combined with its chemical specificity allows in situ and in vivo biochemical quantification at submicrometer resolution without sectioning and staining. Current hyperspectral SRS data analysis methods are based on either linear unmixing or multivariate analysis, which are not sensitive to small spectral variations and often provide obscure information on the cell composition. Here, we demonstrate a spectral phasor analysis method that allows fast and reliable cellular organelle segmentation of mammalian cells, without any a priori knowledge of their composition or basis spectra. We further show that, in combination with a branch-bound algorithm for optimal selection of a few wavenumbers, spectral phasor analysis provides a robust solution to label-free single cell analysis.;2014;10.1021/ac500014b
J;Quasi-simultaneous multimodal imaging of cutaneous tissue oxygenation and perfusion;Simultaneous and quantitative assessment of multiple tissue parameters may facilitate more effective diagnosis and therapy in many clinical applications, such as wound healing. However, existing wound assessment methods are typically subjective and qualitative, with the need for sequential data acquisition and coregistration between modalities, and lack of reliable standards for performance evaluation or calibration. To overcome these limitations, we developed a multimodal imaging system for quasi-simultaneous assessment of cutaneous tissue oxygenation and perfusion in a quantitative and noninvasive fashion. The system integrated multispectral and laser speckle imaging technologies into one experimental setup. Tissue oxygenation and perfusion were reconstructed by advanced algorithms. The accuracy and reliability of the imaging system were quantitatively validated in calibration experiments and a tissue-simulating phantom test. The experimental results were compared with a commercial oxygenation and perfusion monitor. Dynamic detection of cutaneous tissue oxygenation and perfusion was also demonstrated in vivo by a postocclusion reactive hyperemia procedure in a human subject and a wound healing process in a wounded mouse model. Our in vivo experiments not only validated the performance of the multimodal imaging system for cutaneous tissue oxygenation and perfusion imaging but also demonstrated its technical potential for wound healing assessment in clinical practice.

J;Non-invasive in vivo hyperspectral imaging of the retina for potential biomarker use in Alzheimer's disease;Studies of rodent models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and of human tissues suggest that the retinal changes that occur in AD, including the accumulation of amyloid beta (A beta), may serve as surrogate markers of brain A beta levels. As A beta has a wavelength-dependent effect on light scatter, we investigate the potential for in vivo retinal hyperspectral imaging to serve as a biomarker of brain A beta. Significant differences in the retinal reflectance spectra are found between individuals with high A beta burden on brain PET imaging and mild cognitive impairment (n = 15), and age-matched PET-negative controls (n = 20). Retinal imaging scores are correlated with brain A beta loads. The findings are validated in an independent cohort, using a second hyperspectral camera. A similar spectral difference is found between control and 5xFAD transgenic mice that accumulate A beta in the brain and retina. These findings indicate that retinal hyperspectral imaging may predict brain A beta load.;2019;10.1038/s41467-019-12242-1
J;Polymeric nanosystems for near-infrared multispectral photoacoustic imaging: Synthesis, characterization and in vivo evaluation;Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a new biomedical imaging modality based on light triggered ultrasound emission. For in vivo application, materials with gobd photoacustic response to illumination in the near-infrared spectrum and suited tissue delivery strategies are needed. We developed polymeric, near-infrared responsive nanomaterials tuned for in vivo application based on oxazoline block copolymer chemistry by living cationic polymerization and a related functional transformation, loaded with a new pho'tonic material, hydrophobized phthalocyanine Zinc complex (H-PcZn), that was efficiently encapsulated into the nanoparticles by self-assembly. The resulting nanoparticles P-NPs and N-NPs bear positive, and negative surface charge, respectively. After physicochemical characterization, applicability of the two nanoparticles as photoacoustic contrast agents was evaluated in vitro and in phantom experiments, where they exhibited excellent PAI contrast. In vivo distribution and visualization of P-NPs and N-NPs following i.v. injection imaged by PAI was confirmed by cryosection fluorescence analysis and showed that the Materials accumulated in tissues within 1 h with differential tissue distribution. This pilot study thus describes synthesis of a novel polymeric photoacoustic nanosystem and demonstrates its potential for multimodal, photoacoustic in vivo imaging and for fluorescence imaging.

J;Applications of Vibrational Spectroscopy for Analysis of Connective Tissues;Advances in vibrational spectroscopy have propelled new insights into the molecular composition and structure of biological tissues. In this review, we discuss common modalities and techniques of vibrational spectroscopy, and present key examples to illustrate how they have been applied to enrich the assessment of connective tissues. In particular, we focus on applications of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), near infrared (NIR) and Raman spectroscopy to assess cartilage and bone properties. We present strengths and limitations of each approach and discuss how the combination of spectrometers with microscopes (hyperspectral imaging) and fiber optic probes have greatly advanced their biomedical applications. We show how these modalities may be used to evaluate virtually any type of sample (ex vivo, in situ or in vivo) and how spectral fingerprints can be interpreted to quantify outcomes related to tissue composition and quality. We highlight the unparalleled advantage of vibrational spectroscopy as a label-free and often nondestructive approach to assess properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) associated with normal, developing, aging, pathological and treated tissues. We believe this review will assist readers not only in better understanding applications of FTIR, NIR and Raman spectroscopy, but also in implementing these approaches for their own research projects.;2021;10.3390/molecules26040922
J;Tumor specific liposomes improve detection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in vivo using optoacoustic tomography;Background: Pancreatic cancer often goes undiagnosed until late stage disease due in part to suboptimal early detection. Our goal was to develop a Syndecan-1 tagged liposome containing fluorescent dye as an improved contrast agent for detection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in vivo using multispectral optoacoustic tomography. Results: The diagnostic capabilities and specificity to pancreatic adenocarcinoma of Syndecan-1 targeted liposomes were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Immunocytochemistry showed that liposomes preferentially bound to and released their contents into cells expressing high levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor. We determined that the contents of the liposome were released into the cell as noted by the change in propidium iodide fluorescence from green to red based upon nucleic acid binding. In an orthotopic mouse model, the liposomes preferentially targeted the pancreatic tumor with little off-target binding in the liver and spleen. Peak accumulation of the liposomes in the tumor occurred at 8 h post-injection. Multispectral optoacoustic tomographic imaging was able to provide high-resolution 3D images of the tumor and liposome location. Ex vivo analysis showed that non-targeted liposomes accumulated in the liver, suggesting that specificity of the liposomes for pancreatic adenocarcinoma was due to the presence of the Syndecan-1 ligand. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that Syndecan-1 liposomes were able to release cargo into IGF1-R expressing tumor cells. The Syndecan-1 liposomes demonstrated tumor specificity in orthotopic pancreatic cancer as observed using multispectral optoacoustic tomography with reduced kidney and liver uptake. By targeting the liposome with Syndecan-1, this nanovehicle has potential as a targeted theranostic nanoparticle for both drug and contrast agent delivery to pancreatic tumors.;2015;10.1186/s12951-015-0139-8
C;Visible spectroscopic imaging studies of normal and ischemic dermal tissue;We describe a non-invasive, in vivo hyperspectral imaging method for visualizing the spatial distribution of dermal tissue oxygenation. Real-time images of the dermis are acquired both at multiple, contiguous wavelengths and at relatively narrow spectral bandwidths to generate a data cube consisting of one spectral and two spatial dimensions. For data collection, the sample area is illuminated by radiation, which is delivered by liquid light guides from a quartz tungsten halogen (QTH) source. Reflected light from the sample is first passed through a liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF) and then imaged onto a silicon charged coupled device (CCD) detector. The subsequently digitized data are presented in terms of spectral images reflecting multivariate least squares analyses based upon linear combinations of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin reference spectra. The generated gray scale images directly represent the varying spatial distributions of dermal tissue oxygenation. As an example, imaging data are obtained from normal tissue and induced ischemic tissue for which both the venous and arterial blood flow was artificially occluded.;2000;10.1117/12.384958
J;In Vivo Chemiluminescent Imaging Agents for Nitroreductase and Tissue Oxygenation;Tissue oxygenation is a driving parameter of the tumor microenvironment, and hypoxia can be a prognostic indicator of aggressiveness, metastasis, and poor response to therapy. Here, we report a chemiluminescence imaging (CLI) agent based on the oxygen-dependent reduction of a nitroaromatic spiroadamantane 1,2-dioxetane scaffold. Hypoxia ChemiLuminescent Probe 2 (HyCL-2) responds to nitroreductase with similar to 170-fold increase in luminescence intensity and high selectivity for enzymatic reductase versus other small molecule reductants. HyCL-2 can image exogenous nitroreductase in vitro and in vivo in living mice, and total luminescent intensity is increased by similar to 6-fold under low oxygen conditions. H-yCL-2 is demonstrated to report on tumor oxygenation during an oxygen challenge in H1299 lung tumor xenografts grown in a murine model as independently confirmed using multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging of hemoglobin oxygenation.;2016;10.1021/acs.analchem.6b01096
J;NADH-fluorescence scattering correction for absolute concentration determination in a liquid tissue phantom using a novel multispectral magnetic-resonance-imaging-compatible needle probe;In this report, a quantitative nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrate (NADH) fluorescence measurement algorithm in a liquid tissue phantom using a fiber-optic needle probe is presented. To determine the absolute concentrations of NADH in this phantom, the fluorescence emission spectra at 465 nm were corrected using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy between 600 nm and 940 nm. The patented autoclavable Nitinol needle probe enables the acquisition of multispectral backscattering measurements of ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared and fluorescence spectra. As a phantom, a suspension of calcium carbonate (Calcilit) and water with physiological NADH concentrations between 0 mmol l(-1) and 2.0 mmol l(-1) were used to mimic human tissue. The light scattering characteristics were adjusted to match the backscattering attributes of human skin by modifying the concentration of Calcilit. To correct the scattering effects caused by the matrices of the samples, an algorithm based on the backscattered remission spectrum was employed to compensate the influence of multiscattering on the optical pathway through the dispersed phase. The monitored backscattered visible light was used to correct the fluorescence spectra and thereby to determine the true NADH concentrations at unknown Calcilit concentrations. Despite the simplicity of the presented algorithm, the root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP) was 0.093 mmol l(-1).;2017;10.1088/1361-6501/aa743e
J;Hyperspectral Imaging of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma for Cancer Margin Detection in Surgical Specimens from 102 Patients Using Deep Learning;Surgical resection of head and neck (H and N) squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) may yield inadequate surgical cancer margins in 10 to 20% of cases. This study investigates the performance of label-free, reflectance-based hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and autofluorescence imaging for SCC detection at the cancer margin in excised tissue specimens from 102 patients and uses fluorescent dyes for comparison. Fresh surgical specimens (n = 293) were collected during H and N SCC resections (n = 102). The tissue specimens were imaged with reflectance-based HSI and autofluorescence imaging and afterwards with two fluorescent dyes for comparison. A histopathological ground truth was made. Deep learning tools were developed to detect SCC with new patient samples (inter-patient) and machine learning for intra-patient tissue samples. Area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operator characteristic was used as the main evaluation metric. Additionally, the performance was estimated in mm increments circumferentially from the tumor-normal margin. In intra-patient experiments, HSI classified conventional SCC with an AUC of 0.82 up to 3 mm from the cancer margin, which was more accurate than proflavin dye and autofluorescence (both p < 0.05). Intra-patient autofluorescence imaging detected human papilloma virus positive (HPV+) SCC with an AUC of 0.99 at 3 mm and greater accuracy than proflavin dye (p < 0.05). The inter-patient results showed that reflectance-based HSI and autofluorescence imaging outperformed proflavin dye and standard red, green, and blue (RGB) images (p < 0.05). In new patients, HSI detected conventional SCC in the larynx, oropharynx, and nasal cavity with 0.85-0.95 AUC score, and autofluorescence imaging detected HPV+ SCC in tonsillar tissue with 0.91 AUC score. This study demonstrates that label-free, reflectance-based HSI and autofluorescence imaging methods can accurately detect the cancer margin in ex-vivo specimens within minutes. This non-ionizing optical imaging modality could aid surgeons and reduce inadequate surgical margins during SCC resections.;2019;10.3390/cancers11091367
J;In vivo accuracy of multispectral magnetic resonance imaging for identifying lipid-rich necrotic cores and intraplaque hemorrhage in advanced human carotid plaques;Background-High-resolution MRI has been shown to be capable of identifying plaque constituents, such as the necrotic core and intraplaque hemorrhage, in human carotid atherosclerosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate differential contrast-weighted images, specifically a multispectral MR technique, to improve the accuracy of identifying the lipid-rich necrotic core and acute intraplaque hemorrhage in vivo. Methods and Results-Eighteen patients scheduled for carotid endarterectomy underwent a preoperative carotid MRI examination in a 1.5-T GE Signa scanner using a protocol that generated 4 contrast weightings (T1, T2, proton density, and 3D time of flight). MR images of the vessel wall were examined for the presence of a lipid-rich necrotic core and/or intraplaque hemorrhage. Ninety cross sections were compared with matched histological sections of the excised specimen in a double-blinded fashion. Overall accuracy (95% CI) of multispectral MRI was 87% (80% to 94%), sensitivity was 85% (78% to 92%), and specificity was 92% (86% to 98%). There was good agreement between MRI and histological findings, with a value of kappa =0.69 (0.53 to 0.85). Conclusions-Multispectral MRI can identify the lipid-rich necrotic core in human carotid atherosclerosis in vivo with high sensitivity and specificity. This MRI technique provides a noninvasive tool to study the pathogenesis and natural history of carotid atherosclerosis. Furthermore, it will permit a direct assessment of the effect of pharmacological therapy, such as aggressive lipid lowering, on plaque lipid composition.;2001;10.1161/hc4201.097839
C;Multiclass Brain Tumor Classification Using Hyperspectral Imaging and Supervised Machine Learning;Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) can be used as a non invasive medical diagnostic method when used in combination with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. The significant captured data in HSI can be useful for classifying different types of brain tissues, since they gather reflectance values from different band widths below and beyond the visual spectrum. This allows ML algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) to classify brain tissues such as tumors. Predicted results can be used to create visualizations and support neurosurgeons before injuring any tissue. This way neurosurgeons can be more precise, reducing any possible damages on healthy tissues. In this work, a proposal for the classification of in-vivo brain hyperspectral images using SVM and RF classifiers is presented. A total of four hyperspectral images from four different patients with glioblastoma grade IV (GBM) brain tumor have been selected to train models and, therefore, classify them. Five different classes have been defined during experiments: healthy tissue, tumor, venous blood vessel, arterial blood vessel and dura mater. Results obtained suggest that SVM usually performs better than RF, generally achieving up to 97% of mean accuracy (ACC). However, RF performance had better results than SVM when classifying images used during training, obtaining almost 100% of mean ACC for all 5 classes described. This study shows the robustness of SVM and the potential of RF for real-time brain cancer detection.;2020;
C;Real-time imaging of renal clearance using Multi-Spectral Optoacoustic Tomography;Multi-Spectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) offers real time imaging that simultaneously exploits high ultrasound resolutions and strong optical contrast. It allows visualizing absorbers in tissue by using their distinct spectral absorption profiles. This work presents a non-invasive in vivo study of kinetics involved in the clearance of carboxylated dye in mouse kidneys. The distinction between probe uptake in different regions of the kidneys is studied, providing insights into its physiologic processes.;2012;10.1117/12.907975
J;Hyperspectral Imaging Using Flexible Endoscopy for Laryngeal Cancer Detection;Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is increasingly gaining acceptance in the medical field. Up until now, HSI has been used in conjunction with rigid endoscopy to detect cancer in vivo. The logical next step is to pair HSI with flexible endoscopy, since it improves access to hard-to-reach areas. While the flexible endoscope's fiber optic cables provide the advantage of flexibility, they also introduce an interfering honeycomb-like pattern onto images. Due to the substantial impact this pattern has on locating cancerous tissue, it must be removed before the HS data can be further processed. Thereby, the loss of information is to minimize avoiding the suppression of small-area variations of pixel values. We have developed a system that uses flexible endoscopy to record HS cubes of the larynx and designed a special filtering technique to remove the honeycomb-like pattern with minimal loss of information. We have confirmed its feasibility by comparing it to conventional filtering techniques using an objective metric and by applying unsupervised and supervised classifications to raw and pre-processed HS cubes. Compared to conventional techniques, our method successfully removes the honeycomb-like pattern and considerably improves classification performance, while preserving image details.;2016;10.3390/s16081288
J;Dual-axis optical coherence tomography for deep tissue imaging;We have developed dual-axis optical coherence tomography (DA-OCT) which enables deep tissue imaging by using a novel off-axis illumination/detection configuration. DA-OCT offers a 100-fold speed increase compared with its predecessor, multispectral multiple-scattering low coherence interferometry (ms2/LCI), by using a new beam scanning mechanism based on a microelectro-mechanical system (MEMS) mirror. The data acquisition scheme was altered to take advantage of this scanning speed, producing tomographic images at a rate of 4 frames (B-scans) per second. DA-OCT differs from ms2/LCI in that the dual axes intersect at a shallower depth (similar to 1 mm). This difference, coupled with the faster scanning speed, shifts the detection priority from multiply scattered to ballistic light. The utility of this approach was demonstrated by imaging both ex vivo porcine ear skin and in vivo rat skin from a McFarlane flap model. The enhanced penetration depth provided by the DA-OCT system will be beneficial to various clinical applications in dermatology and surgery.

J;In vivo optical molecular imaging of inflammation and immunity;Inflammation is the phenotypic form of various diseases. Recent development in molecular imaging provides new insights into the diagnostic and therapeutic evaluation of different inflammatory diseases as well as diseases involving inflammation such as cancer. While conventional imaging techniques used in the clinical setting provide only indirect measures of inflammation such as increased perfusion and altered endothelial permeability, optical imaging is able to report molecular information on diseased tissue and cells. Optical imaging is a quick, noninvasive, nonionizing, and easy-to-use diagnostic technology which has been successfully applied for preclinical research. Further development of optical imaging technology such as optoacoustic imaging overcomes the limitations of mere fluorescence imaging, thereby enabling pilot clinical applications in humans. By means of endogenous and exogenous contrast agents, sites of inflammation can be accurately visualized in vivo. This allows for early disease detection and specific disease characterization, enabling more rapid and targeted therapeutic interventions. In this review, we summarize currently available optical imaging techniques used to detect inflammation, including optical coherence tomography (OCT), bioluminescence, fluorescence, optoacoustics, and Raman spectroscopy. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of the different in vivo imaging applications with a special focus on targeting inflammation including immune cell tracking.;2021;10.1007/s00109-021-02115-w
J;Multimodal Nanocarrier Probes Reveal Superior Biodistribution Quantification by Isotopic Analysis over Fluorescence;Absolute measurements of biodistribution are essential for understanding and optimizing the function of nanomaterials for in vivo diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Biodistribution analysis by optical imaging is desirable due to its low cost, wide accessibility, and high throughput nature, but it is substantially less accurate than isotopic and chemical techniques. In this work, we developed multimodal probes for optical and nuclear imaging to analyze the quantitative limits of optical contrast in the red and near-infrared spectra for polysaccharide nanocarriers targeting macrophage cells. Probes incorporating three zwitterionic fluorophores together with radioactive copper distributed diffusely to optically dissimilar tissues that were either white (visceral adipose tissue) or dark red (liver and spleen) in obese rodents. We used in vivo positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging, in vivo hyperspectral tomographic fluorescence imaging, and ex vivo optical and isotopic analyses to determine correlations between optical and nuclear signals. PET imaging strongly correlated with standardized ex vivo methods for all tissue types, whereas no fluorescence signals exhibited substantial accuracy in quantification or localization in vivo. Optical imaging of resected tissues was most accurate in the 700 nm wavelength window, but only in white tissues. This work suggests that fluorescence can be used to measure diffuse probe distribution in white tissues over time or across animals, but not red tissues and not deep in the body. This work also highlights the importance of choosing validated experimental protocols and describes how optical measurements are impacted by fluorophore class and spectral properties, tissue properties, and imaging workflow.;2020;10.1021/acsnano.9b06504
J;Photoacoustic imaging of periorbital skin cancer ex vivo: unique spectral signatures of malignant melanoma, basal, and squamous cell carcinoma;Radical excision of periorbital skin tumors is difficult without sacrificing excessive healthy tissue. Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is an emerging non-invasive biomedical imaging modality that has potential for intraoperative micrographic control of surgical margins. This is the first study to assess the feasibility of PA imaging for the detection of periocular skin cancer. Eleven patients underwent surgical excision of periocular skin cancer, one of which was a malignant melanoma (MM), eight were basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), and two squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Six tumors were located in the eyelid, and five in periocular skin. The excised samples, as well as healthy eyelid samples, were scanned with PA imaging postoperatively, using 59 wavelengths in the range 680-970 nm, to generate 3D multispectral images. Spectral unmixing was performed using endmember spectra for oxygenated and deoxygenated Hb, melanin, and collagen, to identify the chromophore composition of tumors and healthy eyelid tissue. After PA scanning, the tumor samples were examined histopathologically using standard hematoxylin and eosin staining. The PA spectra of healthy eyelid tissue were dominated by melanin in the skin, oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the orbicularis oculi muscle, and collagen in the tarsal plate. Multiwavelength 3D scanning provided spectral information on the three tumor types. The spectrum from the MM was primarily reconstructed by the endmember melanin, while the SCCs showed contributions primarily from melanin, but also HbR and collagen. BCCs showed contributions from all four endmembers with a predominance of HbO(2) and HbR. PA imaging may be used to distinguish different kinds of periocular skin tumors, paving the way for future intraoperative micrographic control.

C;Multispectral photoacoustic imaging of nerves with a clinical ultrasound system;Accurate and efficient identification of nerves is of great importance during many ultrasound-guided clinical procedures, including nerve blocks and prostate biopsies. It can be challenging to visualise nerves with conventional ultrasound imaging, however. One of the challenges is that nerves can have very similar appearances to nearby structures such as tendons. Several recent studies have highlighted the potential of near-infrared optical spectroscopy for differentiating nerves and adjacent tissues, as this modality can be sensitive to optical absorption of lipids that are present in intra- and extra-neural adipose tissue and in the myelin sheaths. These studies were limited to point measurements, however. In this pilot study, a custom photoacoustic system with a clinical ultrasound imaging probe was used to acquire multi-spectral photoacoustic images of nerves and tendons from swine ex vivo, across the wavelength range of 1100 to 1300 nm. Photoacoustic images were processed and overlaid in colour onto co-registered conventional ultrasound images that were acquired with the same imaging probe. A pronounced optical absorption peak centred at 1210 nm was observed in the photoacoustic signals obtained from nerves, and it was absent in those obtained from tendons. This absorption peak, which is consistent with the presence of lipids, provides a novel image contrast mechanism to significantly enhance the visualization of nerves. In particular, image contrast for nerves was up to 5.5 times greater with photoacoustic imaging (0.82 +/- 0.15) than with conventional ultrasound imaging (0.148 +/- 0.002), with a maximum contrast of 0.95 +/- 0.02 obtained in photoacoustic mode. This pilot study demonstrates the potential of photoacoustic imaging to improve clinical outcomes in ultrasound-guided interventions in regional anaesthesia and interventional oncology.;2014;10.1117/12.2036717
J;Raman spectroscopy based pathological analysis and discrimination of formalin fixed paraffin embedded breast cancer tissue;The application of Raman microspectroscopy in the histopathological analysis have been widely pursued for characterizing ex vivo biological tissue, and for reducing the number of false positive biopsies and increase the cancer diagnosis accuracy. Many studies have been carried out on fresh or frozen tissue samples, which preserved comprehensive qualitative and quantitative compositional information. However, by the wider applicability of dewaxed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples in the hospital, an abundant tissue bank is a useful resource for the on-site retrospective research to improve diagnosis accuracy. Therefore, we implemented an ex vivo Raman spectroscopic study combined multivariate analysis methods for presenting a better understanding of the sample processing effects and testifying the potential Raman based pathological analysis capabilities of FFPE sections. By comparing 600 spectra from thirty-six fresh frozen (n=18) and FFPE breast tissue samples (n=18), including Healthy tissue, Ductal Carcinoma In Situ, and Invasive Ductal Carcinoma tissue, the results demon-strated that the dewaxing process significantly altered the biochemical composition of the tissues, particularly lipids, proteins, and carotenoids. Even though, the analytical result proved that commonly used multivariate analysis methods, including principal component analysis -linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), could still distinguish the investigated tissue types effectively with satisfying overall accuracy in which PCA-LDA is 88.3 %, PLS-DA is 93.0 %. Therefore, this study confirmed that FFPE sections have diagnostic potential with multivariate analytical model provided that the biochemical changes, meanwhile tissue processing should be aware.;2021;10.1016/j.vibspec.2021.103260
J;Label-free spectroscopic tissue characterization using fluorescence excitation-scanning spectral imaging;Spectral imaging approaches provide new possibilities for measuring and discriminating fluorescent molecules in living cells and tissues. These approaches often employ tunable filters and robust image processing algorithms to identify many fluorescent labels in a single image set. Here, we present results from a novel spectral imaging technology that scans the fluorescence excitation spectrum, demonstrating that excitation-scanning hyperspectral image data can discriminate among tissue types and estimate the molecular composition of tissues. This approach allows fast, accurate quantification of many fluorescent species from multivariate image data without the need of exogenous labels or dyes. We evaluated the ability of the excitation-scanning approach to identify endogenous fluorescence signatures in multiple unlabeled tissue types. Signatures were screened using multi-pass principal component analysis. Endmember extraction techniques revealed conserved autofluorescent signatures across multiple tissue types. We further examined the ability to detect known molecular signatures by constructing spectral libraries of common endogenous fluorophores and applying multiple spectral analysis techniques on test images from lung, liver and kidney. Spectral deconvolution revealed structure-specific morphologic contrast generated from pure molecule signatures. These results demonstrate that excitation-scanning spectral imaging, coupled with spectral imaging processing techniques, provides an approach for discriminating among tissue types and assessing the molecular composition of tissues. Additionally, excitation scanning offers the ability to rapidly screen molecular markers across a range of tissues without using fluorescent labels. This approach lays the groundwork for translation of excitation-scanning technologies to clinical imaging platforms.;2020;10.1002/jbio.201900183
C;Multispectral Fluorescence Detection of Pigmented Cutaneous Tumours;"We investigated pigmented skin tumour lesions in vivo and ex vivo, including benign and dysplastic nevi, as well as malignant lesions, such as pigmented basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and malignant melanoma (MM) lesions, to obtain a complex view about the feasibility of different excitation sources solely and/or in combination to induce fluorescence signal useful for diagnosis of various low-fluorescent cutaneous neoplasia. A specialized multispectral analysis of the data obtained was applied by using excitation in broad spectral range, covering ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared spectral range, that contribute considerably to: (1) fundamental determination of tumour tissues' spectral properties, and (2) to increase the accuracy in determining the type of cutaneous pathology. The chromophores, related to the formation of ultraviolet and visible (UV-VIS) fluorescence in human normal skin and its pigmented lesions are mainly amino acids - tryptophan, tyrosine; structural proteins and their cross-links - collagen, elastin, keratin; co-enzymes - NADH, flavins; vitamins and lipids. In the near-infrared (NIR) spectral region, skin fluorescence emission properties are related to the presence of melanin pigment, lipids and endogenous porphyrins, if any, as the highest impact on the resultant emission spectrum is due to the melanin compound.";2020;10.1117/12.2581967
J;Structural and functional 3D mapping of skin tumours with non-invasive multispectral optoacoustic tomography;Background: Recent advances in technology have enabled the development of various non-invasive skin imaging tools to aid real-time diagnosis of both benign and malignant skin tumours, minimizing the need for invasive skin biopsy. Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is a recently developed non-invasive imaging tool, which offers the unique capacity for high resolution three dimensional (3D) optical mapping of tissue by further delivering highly specific optical contrast from a depth of several millimetres to centimetres in living tissues. MSOT enables volumetric, spectroscopic differentiation of tissue, both in vivo and in real time, with and without the application of biomarker-specific probes, and is further able of providing spatial maps of skin chromophores, as well as underlying blood vasculature. Methods: Three patients with suspicious skin tumours consented to have their lesions imaged with MSOT prior to excision. The histological findings and measurements were compared. Results: We demonstrated the first in vivo clinical use of MSOT for 3D reconstruction of skin tumours in three patients with good histological correlation. Conclusion: Our findings confirm the potential benefit of the new imaging method in guiding surgical intervention to achieve a more precise excision with better clearance and lower relapse rates. It can also potentially help to shorten the duration of Mohs' micrographic surgery. Further large-scale studies are necessary to ensure correlation between MSOT and histology.;2017;10.1111/srt.12326
J;Multimodal imaging approach to monitor browning of adipose tissue in vivo;The discovery that white adipocytes can undergo a browning process to become metabolically active beige cells has attracted significant interest in the fight against obesity. However, the study of adipose browning has been impeded by a lack of imaging tools that allow longitudinal and noninvasive monitoring of this process in vivo. Here, we report a preclinical imaging approach to detect development of beige adipocytes during adrenergic stimulation. In this approach, we expressed near-infrared fluorescent protein, iRFP720, driven under an uncoupling protein-1 (Ucp1) promoter in mice by viral transduction, and used multispectral optoacoustic imaging technology with ultrasound tomography (MSOT-US) to assess adipose beiging during adrenergic stimulation. We observed increased photoacoustic signal at 720 nm, coupled with attenuated lipid signals in stimulated animals. As a proof of concept, we validated our approach against hybrid positron emission tomography combined with magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging modality, and quantified the extent of adipose browning by MRI-guided segmentation of 2-deoxy-2-F-18-fluoro-d-glucose uptake signals. The browning extent detected by MSOT-US and PET/MR are well correlated with Ucp1 induction. Taken together, these systems offer great opportunities for preclinical screening aimed at identifying compounds that promote adipose browning and translation of these discoveries into clinical studies of humans.;2018;10.1194/jlr.D083410
C;Homing Peptide Guiding Optical Molecular Imaging for the Diagnosis of Bladder Cancer;Background The limitations of primary transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBt) have led the residual tumors rates as high as 75%. The intraoperative fluorescence imaging offers a great potential for improving TURBt have been confirmed. So we aim to distinguish the residual tumors and normal mucosa using fluorescence molecular imaging formed by conjugated molecule of the CSNRDARRC bladder cancer homing peptide with fluorescent dye. The conjugated molecule was abbreviated FIuo-ACP. In our study, we will research the image features of FIuo-ACP probe targeted bladder cancer for fluorescence molecular imaging diagnosis for bladder cancer in vivo and ex vivo. Methods After the FIuo-ACP probe was synthetized, the binding sites, factors affecting binding rates, the specificity and the targeting of Fluo-ACP labeled with bladder cancer cells were studied respectively by laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM), immunofluorescence and multispectral fluorescence ex vivo optical molecular imaging system. Results The binding sites were located in nucleus and the binding rates were correlated linearly with the dose of probe and the grade of pathology. Moreover, the probe has a binding specificity with bladder cancer in vivo and ex vivo. Tumor cells being labeled by the Fluo-ACP, bright green spots were observed under LSCM. The tissue samples and tumor cells can be labeled and identified by fluorescence microscope. Optical molecular imaging of xenograft tumor tissues was exhibited as fluorescent spots under EMCCD. Conclusion The CSNRDARRC peptides might be a useful bladder cancer targeting vector. The FIuo-ACP molecular probe was suitable for fluorescence molecular imaging diagnosis for bladder cancer in vivo and ex vivo.;2014;10.1117/12.2071227
C;Hyperspectral fluorescence imaging system for biomedical diagnostics;An advanced hyper-spectral imaging (HSI) system has been developed for use in medical diagnostics. One such diagnostic, esophageal cancer is diagnosed currently through biopsy and subsequent pathology. The end goal of this research is to develop an optical-based technique to assist or replace biopsy. In this paper, we demonstrate an instrument that has the capability to optically diagnose cancer in laboratory mice. We have developed a real-time HSI system based on state-of-the-art liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF) technology coupled to an endoscope. This unique HSI technology is being developed to obtain spatially resolved images of the slight differences in luminescent properties of normal versus tumorous tissues. In this report, an in-vivo mouse study is shown. A predictive measure of cancer for the mice studied is developed and shown. It is hoped that the results of this study will lead to advances in the optical diagnosis of esophageal cancer in humans.;2006;10.1117/12.664113
C;In vivo detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia by multimodal colposcopy;Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for women in developing countries. Colposcopy plays an important role in early screening and detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). In this paper, we developed a multimodal colposcopy system that combines multispectral reflectance, autofluorescence, and RGB imaging for in vivo detection of CIN, which is capable of dynamically recording multimodal data of the same region of interest (ROI). We studied the optical properties of cervical tissue to determine multi-wavelengths for different imaging modalities. Advanced algorithms based on the second derivative spectrum and the fluorescence intensity were developed to differentiate cervical tissue into two categories: squamous normal (SN) and high grade (HG) dysplasia. In the results, the kinetics of cervical reflectance and autofluorescence characteristics pre and post acetic acid application were observed and analyzed, and the image segmentation revealed good consistency with the gold standard of histopathology. Our pilot study demonstrated the clinical potential of this multimodal colposcopic system for in vivo detection of cervical cancer.;2016;10.1117/12.2212194
J;Hyperspectral imaging of hemoglobin saturation in tumor microvasculature and tumor hypoxia development;Tumor hypoxia has been shown to have prognostic value in clinical trials involving radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery. Tumor oxygenation studies at microvascular levels can provide understanding of oxygen transport on scales at which oxygen transfer to tissue occurs. To fully grasp the significance of blood oxygen delivery and hypoxia at microvascular levels during tumor growth and angiogenesis, the spatial and temporal relationship of the data must be preserved and mapped. Using tumors grown in window chamber models, hyperspectral imaging can provide serial spatial maps of blood oxygenation in terms of hemoglobin saturation at the microvascular level. We describe our application of hyperspectral imaging for in vivo microvascular tumor oxygen transport studies using red fluorescent protein (RFP) to identify all tumor cells, and hypoxia-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP) to identify the hypoxic fraction. 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma cells, stably transfected with both reporter genes, are grown in dorsal skin-fold window chambers. Hyperspectral imaging is used to create image maps of hemoglobin saturation, and classify image pixels where RFP alone is present (tumor cells), or both RFP and GFP are present (hypoxic tumor cells). In this work, in vivo calibration of the imaging system is described and in vivo results are shown. (C) 2005 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.;2005;10.1117/1.2003369
C;A simultaneous multimodal imaging system for tissue functional parameters;Simultaneous and quantitative assessment of skin functional characteristics in different modalities will facilitate diagnosis and therapy in many clinical applications such as wound healing. However, many existing clinical practices and multimodal imaging systems are subjective, qualitative, sequential for multimodal data collection, and need co-registration between different modalities. To overcome these limitations, we developed a multimodal imaging system for quantitative, non-invasive, and simultaneous imaging of cutaneous tissue oxygenation and blood perfusion parameters. The imaging system integrated multispectral and laser speckle imaging technologies into one experimental setup. A Labview interface was developed for equipment control, synchronization, and image acquisition. Advanced algorithms based on a wide gap second derivative reflectometry and laser speckle contrast analysis (LASCA) were developed for accurate reconstruction of tissue oxygenation and blood perfusion respectively. Quantitative calibration experiments and a new style of skin-simulating phantom were designed to verify the accuracy and reliability of the imaging system. The experimental results were compared with a Moor tissue oxygenation and perfusion monitor. For In vivo testing, a post-occlusion reactive hyperemia (PORH) procedure in human subject and an ongoing wound healing monitoring experiment using dorsal skinfold chamber models were conducted to validate the usability of our system for dynamic detection of oxygenation and perfusion parameters. In this study, we have not only setup an advanced multimodal imaging system for cutaneous tissue oxygenation and perfusion parameters but also elucidated its potential for wound healing assessment in clinical practice.;2014;10.1117/12.2041008
J;Osteopontin-targeted probe detects orthotopic breast cancers using optoacoustic imaging;Improved detection of breast cancer using highly sensitive, tumor-specific imaging would facilitate diagnosis, surveillance and assessment of response to treatment. We conjugated osteopontin peptide to an infrared fluorescent dye to serve as a contrast agent for detection of breast cancer by multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT). Selective binding of the osteopontin-based probe was identified using flow cytometry and near infrared fluorescent imaging in triple negative and HER2 positive breast cancer cell lines in vitro. Osteopontin-750 accumulation was evaluated in vivo using MSOT with secondary confirmation of signal accumulation using near infrared fluorescent imaging. The osteopontin-based probe demonstrated binding to breast cancer cells in vitro. Similarly, after intravenous administration of the osteopontin-750 probe, it accumulated preferentially in the subcutaneous breast tumor in nude mice (557 MSOT a.u. compared to untargeted organs such as kidney (53.7 MSOT a.u.) and liver (32.1 MSOT a.u.). At 2.5 h post-injection, signal intensity within the tumor was 9.7 and 17 times greater in the tumor bed than in the kidney or liver, respectively. Fluorescence imaging ex vivo comparing tumor signal to that of nontarget organs confirmed the results in vivo. MSOT imaging demonstrated selective accumulation of the fluorescent osteopontin targeting probe to tumor sites both in vitro and in vivo, and provided high-resolution images. Further development of this tool is promising for advanced diagnostic imaging, disease surveillance and therapeutic models that limit nontarget toxicity.;2018;10.1080/10520295.2018.1514466
J;A Hyperspectral Imaging System for Mapping Haemoglobin and Cytochrome-c-Oxidase Concentration Changes in the Exposed Cerebral Cortex;We present a novel hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system using visible and near-infrared (NIR) light on the exposed cerebral cortex of animals, to monitor and quantify in vivo changes in the oxygenation of haemoglobin and in cellular metabolism via measurement of the redox states of cytochrome-c-oxidase (CCO). The system, named hNIR, is based on spectral scanning illumination at 11 bands (600, 630, 665, 784, 800, 818, 835, 851, 868, 881 and 894 nm), using a supercontinuum laser coupled with a rotating Pellin-Broca prism. Image reconstruction is performed with the aid of a Monte Carlo framework for photon pathlength estimation and past-processing correction of partial volume effects. The system is validated on liquid optical phantoms mimicking brain tissue haemodynamics and metabolism, and finally applied in vivo on the exposed cortex of mice undergoing alternating oxygenation challenges. The results of the study demonstrate the capacity of hNIR to map and quantify the haemodynamic and metabolic states of the exposed cortex at m icrovascular levels. This represents (to the hest of our knowledge) the first example of simultaneous mapping and quantification of cerebral haemoglobin and CCO in vivo using visible and MR HSI, which can potentially become a powerful tool for better understanding brain physiology.;2021;10.1109/JSTQE.2021.3053634
J;An endoscopic structured light system using multispectral detection;Purpose In clinical examinations, the tissue surface topology is an important feature for detecting the tissue pathology and implementing augmented reality. We have previously presented a miniaturised structured light ( SL) system for recovery of tissue surface shape in minimally invasive surgery ( MIS), based on a flexible multispectral structured illumination probe ( 1.9mm diameter) ( Clancy et al. in Biomed Opt Express 2( 11): 3119- 3128, 2011. doi: 10.1364/ BOE. 2.003119). This paper reports further hardware and analytical developments to improve the light pattern decoding result and increase the reconstruction accuracy. Methods The feasibility of using an 8- band multispectral camerawith higher pattern- colour discrimination ability than normalRGBcamera in this systemwas studied. Additionally, the  normalised cut algorithm was investigated to improve pattern segmentation. Results The whole SL system was evaluated by phantom and in vivo experiments. Higher pattern identification performance than that of an RGB camera was recorded by using the multispectral camera ( average precision > 97%, average sensitivity > 62%). An average of 0.88 0.67mm reconstruction error was achieved using the proposed pattern decoding method on a heart phantom at a working distance of approximately 10 cm. Conclusions The experiment showed the superiority of the multispectral camera over the RGB camera in the spot identification step. The proposed pattern decoding algorithm underwent evaluations using different experiments, showing that it provided promising reconstruction results. The potential of using this system in MIS environments has been demonstrated.;2015;10.1007/s11548-015-1264-4
J;Developments in quantitative oxygen-saturation imaging of breast tissue in vivo using multispectral near-infrared tomography;Imaging of oxygen saturation provides a spatial map of the tissue metabolic activity and has potential in diagnosis and treatment monitoring of breast cancer. Oxygen-saturation imaging is possible through near- infrared (NIR) tomography, but has low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This can be augmented by using NIR tomography as an add- on to MRI. Presented are results from a free-standing NIR system and a hybrid MR-guided system for breast imaging. In results from imaging 60 healthy volunteers in the initial NIR system, oxygen saturation was a significant discriminator between the BIRADS classifications of adipose tissue, heterogeneously dense, and extremely dense tissue. By using the MR-guided NIR system, more accurate tissue-specific data were obtained on adipose and fibroglandular volumes, with 11 healthy volunteers. In these data, oxygen saturation in the adipose tissue correlated with percentage of adipose tissue. In two case studies of infiltrating ductal carcinomas, oxygen saturation was reduced at the site of the tumor, as compared with the surrounding healthy tissue, agreeing with conventional thought that hypoxia exists in larger solid tumors. The MRI-guided NIR images of oxygen saturation provide higher resolution and superior SNR and will likely be used in the future to study and characterize specific tissue volumes.;2007;10.1089/ars.2007.1643
C;Simultaneous 2-D analysis of multiple fluorescent probes using multispectral imaging microscopy;This research discusses the use of a new multispectral imaging system in fluorescence microscopy applications. We present the results of experiments designed to demonstrate the utility of this instrument for biologicial investigations. A phantom object was constructed using fluorescent microspheres and imaged to demonstrate the ability of the system to differentiate microscopic structures based on spectral properties. Excellent spectral isolation of subcellular structures, differentially labeled with fluorescent probes, was also obtained in images of neurons and rat sinusoidal epithelial (RSE-1) cells demonstrating that separation of subcellular structures in biological imaging applications is possible with high spatial resolution (up to 0.25 microns) and excellent signal to noise ratio (SNR > 30). A final imaging experiment using this device with a confocal micro-endoscope shows the flexibility of the developed instrument when used with different imaging systems. In addition, the results indicate that multispectral investigations of tissue in-vivo may be possible.;1999;10.1117/12.346733
J;Hyperspectral hybrid method classification for detecting altered mucosa of the human larynx;Background: In the field of earth observation, hyperspectral detector systems allow precise target detections of surface components from remote sensing platforms. This enables specific land covers to be identified without the need to physically travel to the areas examined. In the medical field, efforts are underway to develop optical technologies that detect altering tissue surfaces without the necessity to perform an excisional biopsy. With the establishment of expedient classification procedures, hyperspectral imaging may provide a non-invasive diagnostic method that allows determination of pathological tissue with high reliability. In this study, we examined the performance of a hyperspectral hybrid method classification for the automatic detection of altered mucosa of the human larynx. Materials and methods: Hyperspectral Imaging was performed in vivo and 30 bands from 390 to 680 nm for 5 cases of laryngeal disorders (2x hemorrhagic polyp, 3x leukoplakia) were obtained. Image stacks were processed with unsupervised clustering (linear spectral unmixing), spectral signatures were extracted from unlabeled cluster maps and subsequently applied as end-members for supervised classification (spectral angle mapper) of further medical cases with identical diagnosis. Results: Linear spectral unmixing clearly highlighted altered mucosa as single spectral clusters in all cases. Matching classes were identified, and extracted spectral signatures could readily be applied for supervised classifications. Automatic target detection performed well, as the considered classes showed notable correspondence with pathological tissue locations. Conclusions: Using hyperspectral classification procedures derived from remote sensing applications for diagnostic purposes can create concrete benefits for the medical field. The approach shows that it would be rewarding to collect spectral signatures from histologically different lesions of laryngeal disorders in order to build up a spectral library and to prospectively allow non-invasive optical biopsies.;2012;10.1186/1476-072X-11-21
C;Pilot study to visualise and measure skin tissue oxygenation, erythema, total haemoglobin and melanin content using index maps in healthy controls;We report on a method for analysing multispectral images of skin in vivo for the measurement and visualisation of skin characteristics. Four different indices were used to characterise skin tissue oxygenation, erythema, total haemoglobin and melanin content. Index values were calculated pixel-wise and combined to create index maps to visualise skin properties. Quantitative measurement of tissue oxygenation saturation was possible by calibrating the oxygenation index using a commercial, calibrated oximeter. Index maps were tested by arterial occlusion of the index finger with multispectral images taken before, during and after occlusion in a pilot study with 10 healthy controls.;2014;10.1117/12.2038571
J;Multispectral autofluorescence dermoscope for skin lesion assessment;Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer. Diagnosis and edge assessment of BCC lesions are based on clinical and dermoscopy evaluation, which are strongly dependent on the expertise and training of the physician. There is a high rate of underdiagnosis because BCC is frequently confused with certain common benign lesions and is often indistinguishable from the surrounding healthy tissue. In the present study, a multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) dermoscopy system, designed for imaging and analyzing the autofluorescence emission of skin tissue, was used to image thirty-eight patients with diagnosed nodular BCC (nBCC) lesions, using clinically acceptable levels of excitation light exposure. With this system, skin autofluorescence was imaged simultaneously using three emission bands: 390 +/- 20 nm, 452 +/- 22 nm, and > 496 nm, preferentially targeting collagen, NADH, and FAD autofluorescence, respectively. Statistical classifiers based on FLIm features developed to discriminate BCC from healthy tissue showed promising performance (ROC area-under-the-curve of 0.82). This study demonstrates the feasibility of clinically performing multispectral endogenous FLIm dermoscopy providing baseline results indicating the potential of this technology as an imageguided tool to improve the delineation of nBCC during surgical lesion resection.;2020;10.1016/j.pdpdt.2020.101704
J;Hyperspectral Imaging of Nanoparticles in Biological Samples: Simultaneous Visualization and Elemental Identification;While engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) are increasingly incorporated into industrial processes and consumer products, the potential biological effects and health outcomes of exposure remain unknown. Novel advanced direct visualization techniques that require less time, cost, and resource investment than electron microscopy (EM) are needed for identifying and locating ENMs in biological samples. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) combines spectrophotometry and imaging, using advanced optics and algorithms to capture a spectrum from 400 to 1000 nm at each pixel in an enhanced dark-field microscopic (EDFM) image. HSI-EDFM can be used to confirm the identity of the materials of interest in a sample and generate an image mapping their presence and location in a sample. Hyperspectral mapping is particularly important for biological samples, where ENM morphology is visually indistinct from surrounding tissue structures. While use of HSI (without mapping) is increasing, no studies to date have compared results from hyperspectral mapping with conventional methods. Thus, the objective of this study was to utilize EDFM-HSI to locate, identify, and map metal oxide ENMs in ex vivo histological porcine skin tissues, a toxicological model of cutaneous exposure, and compare findings with those of Raman spectroscopy (RS), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results demonstrate that EDFM-HSI mapping is capable of locating and identifying ENMs in tissue, as confirmed by conventional methods. This study serves as initial confirmation of EDFM-HSI mapping as a novel and higher throughput technique for ENM identification in biological samples, and serves as the basis for further protocol development utilizing EDFM-HSI for semiquantitation of ENMs. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.;2016;10.1002/jemt.22637
J;Imaging molecular signatures for clinical detection of scleroderma in the hand by multispectral photoacoustic elastic tomography;Scleroderma (SD) is a rare autoimmune disease, which is divided into 2 categories: the localized SD and systemic SD. The localized SD mainly causes skin thickening of the fingers, whereas the systemic SD can further affect the blood vessels and internal organs. In this pilot study, the multispectral photoacoustic elastic tomography (PAET) imaging technique was used to recover the quantitative physiological and elastic properties of biological tissues for the diagnosis of SD. Three healthy subjects and 3 SD patients were recruited and clinically examined by a rheumatologist, and then their hand/fingers were scanned by both magnetic resonance imaging and our home-made photoacoustic imaging system. Physiological parameters including oxygen saturation (STO2), deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb) and oxy-hemoglobin (HbO(2)) concentrations and mechanical properties such as bulk elastic modulus images were reconstructed using the developed PAET reconstruction method. Our imaging results demonstrated that the physiological and elastic parameters exhibit striking differences between the SD and normal fingers, indicating that these biomarkers can serve as molecular signatures for early detection of SD. These quantitative physiological properties and bulk modulus may also pave a new path for improved understanding the pathological mechanism of SD.;2018;10.1002/jbio.201700267
J;Performance characteristics of an interventional multispectral photoacoustic imaging system for guiding minimally invasive procedures;Precise device guidance is important for interventional procedures in many different clinical fields including fetal medicine, regional anesthesia, interventional pain management, and interventional oncology. While ultrasound is widely used in clinical practice for real-time guidance, the image contrast that it provides can be insufficient for visualizing tissue structures such as blood vessels, nerves, and tumors. This study was centered on the development of a photoacoustic imaging system for interventional procedures that delivered excitation light in the ranges of 750 to 900 nm and 1150 to 1300 nm, with an optical fiber positioned in a needle cannula. Coregistered B-mode ultrasound images were obtained. The system, which was based on a commercial ultrasound imaging scanner, has an axial resolution in the vicinity of 100 mu m and a submillimeter, depth-dependent lateral resolution. Using a tissue phantom and 800 nm excitation light, a simulated blood vessel could be visualized at a maximum distance of 15 mm from the needle tip. Spectroscopic contrast for hemoglobin and lipids was observed with ex vivo tissue samples, with photoacoustic signal maxima consistent with the respective optical absorption spectra. The potential for further optimization of the system is discussed. (C) 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE);2015;10.1117/1.JBO.20.8.086005
J;In vivo three-dimensional multispectral photoacoustic imaging of dual enzyme-driven cyclic cascade reaction for tumor catalytic therapy;Non-invasive visualization of dynamic molecular events in real-time via molecular imaging may enable the monitoring of cascade catalytic reactions in living systems, however effective imaging modalities and a robust catalytic reaction system are lacking. Here we utilize three-dimensional (3D) multispectral photoacoustic (PA) molecular imaging to monitor in vivo cascade catalytic therapy based on a dual enzyme-driven cyclic reaction platform. The system consists of a two-dimensional (2D) Pd-based nanozyme conjugated with glucose oxidase (GOx). The combination of nanozyme and GOx can induce the PA signal variation of endogenous molecules. Combined with the PA response of the nanozyme, we can simultaneously map the 3D PA signals of dynamic endogenous and exogenous molecules associated with the catalytic process, thus providing a real-time non-invasive visualization. We can also treat tumors under the navigation of the PA imaging. Therefore, our study demonstrates the imaging-guided potential of 3D multispectral PA imaging in feedback-looped cascade catalytic therapy. Photoacoustic imaging can be used to monitor chemical reaction in cells and tissues. Here, the authors develop a Pd based nanozyme conjugated with glucose oxidase that can induce the change of photoacoustic signals during the catalytic cascade process, the system can also be used to treat tumor-bearing mice.;2022;10.1038/s41467-022-29082-1
J;Wide-field spectral imaging of human ovary autofluorescence and oncologic diagnosis via previously collected probe data;With no sufficient screening test for ovarian cancer, a method to evaluate the ovarian disease state quickly and nondestructively is needed. The authors have applied a wide-field spectral imager to freshly resected ovaries of 30 human patients in a study believed to be the first of its magnitude. Endogenous fluorescence was excited with 365-nm light and imaged in eight emission bands collectively covering the 400- to 640-nm range. Linear discriminant analysis was used to classify all image pixels and generate diagnostic maps of the ovaries. Training the classifier with previously collected single-point autofluorescence measurements of a spectroscopic probe enabled this novel classification. The process by which probe-collected spectra were transformed for comparison with imager spectra is described. Sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 51% were obtained in classifying normal and cancerous ovaries using autofluorescence data alone. Specificity increased to 69% when autofluorescence data were divided by green reflectance data to correct for spatial variation in tissue absorption properties. Benign neoplasm ovaries were also found to classify as nonmalignant using the same algorithm. Although applied ex vivo, the method described here appears useful for quick assessment of cancer presence in the human ovary. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

J;Hyperspectral imaging for in vivo monitoring of cold atmospheric plasma effects on microcirculation in treatment of head and neck cancer and wound healing;Beside a proven antimicrobial and inflammatory-modulating spectrum of plasma therapy, recent studies point to impressive molecular and cellular effects against tumor cells. However, underlying mechanisms of anticancer effects and improved wound healing, in particular plasma associated influence on microcirculation, have not been sufficiently clarified yet. To date, there is no convincing method for monitoring therapy with cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) in vivo. TIVITA (TM) Tissue System is an innovative hybrid technology that combines imaging and spectroscopy for assessment and documentation of tissue. By collecting spectral information, HSI generates a three-dimensional (3D) data cube that enables calculation of different microcirculation parameters. In this research two patients were treated with CAP in context of head and neck tumor therapy. HSI was able to demonstrate CAP associated effects on microcirculation showing a relevant increase of superficial and deeper cutaneous oxygen saturation, hemoglobin concentration and distribution. This effect may contribute to healing support by CAP in wounds as well as tumor disease. Still in scientific development, HSI appears to be suitable for analyzing and monitoring CAP effects in clinical setting. With regard to the limited amount of data, these findings must be verified in a larger study population.;2017;10.1016/j.cpme.2017.09.002
J;OPTICAL IMAGING AND SPECTROSCOPY OF SUPERFICIAL TISSUE;An overview of three techniques developed by our group for imaging superficial tissue is presented. Firstly, a novel polarized light capillaroscope has been developed for imaging the microcirculation. The capillaroscope has been used to make in vivo measurements of sickle cell disorder sufferers with aim of monitoring the polymerization of sickled red blood cells. Secondly, hyperspectral imaging for measuring oxygen saturation is described. The accuracy of such measurements is affected by the non-linear relationship between scattering and absorption and it is demonstrated that polarization techniques can be used to make the relationship more linear, thus improving accuracy. Finally, the use of smart CMOS optical sensors for laser Doppler blood flowmetry is described. A 32x32 pixel imaging array with on-chip processing is described and the potential for full field laser Doppler blood flow imaging is demonstrated through measurement on blood flow of tissue before and after occlusion.;2008;10.1142/S1793545808000091
J;Vessel imaging with viable tumor analysis for quantification of tumor angiogenesis (vol 63, 1637, 2010);"Imaging of tumor microvasculature has become an important tool for studying angiogenesis and monitoring antiangiogenic therapies. Ultrasmall paramagnetic iron oxide contrast agents for indirect imaging of vasculature offer a method for quantitative measurements of vascular biomarkers such as vessel size index, blood volume, and vessel density (Q). Here, this technique is validated with direct comparisons to ex vivo micro-computed tomography angiography and histologic vessel measurements, showing significant correlations between in vivo vascular MRI measurements and ex vivo structural vessel measurements. The sensitivity of the MRI vascular parameters is also demonstrated, in combination with a multispectral analysis technique for segmenting tumor tissue to restrict the analysis to viable tumor tissue and exclude regions of necrosis. It is shown that this viable tumor segmentation increases sensitivity for detection of significant effects on blood volume and Q by two antiangiogenic therapeutics [anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) and anti-neuropilin-1] on an HM7 colorectal tumor model. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor reduced blood volume by 36 +/- 3% (p < 0.0001) and Q by 52 6 3% (p < 0.0001) at 48 h post-treatment; the effects of anti-neuropilin-1 were roughly half as strong with a reduction in blood volume of 18 +/- 6% (p < 0.05) and a reduction in Q of 33 +/- 5% (p < 0.05) at 48 h post-treatment.

C;Boosted Tree Classifier for in Vivo Identification of Early Cervical Cancer using Multispectral Digital Colposcopy;"Background: Cervical cancer develops over several years; screening and early diagnosis have decreased the incidence and mortality threefold over the last fifty years. Opportunities for the application of imaging and automation in the screening process exist in settings where resources are limited. Methods: Patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) underwent imaging with a Multispectral Digital Colposcopy (MDC) prior to have a loop excision of the cervix. The image taken with white light was annotated by a clinician. The excised specimen was mapped by the study histopathologist blinded to the MDC data. This map was used to define areas of high grade in the excised tissue. Eleven reviewers mapped the histopathologic data into the MDC images. The reviewers' maps were analyzed and areas of agreement were calculated. We compared the result of a boosted tree classifier with a previously developed ensemble classifier. Results: Using a boosted tree classifier we obtained a sensitivity of 95%, a specificity of 96%, and an accuracy of 96% on the training sets. When we applied the classifier to a test set, we obtained a sensitivity of 82%, a specificity of 81%, and an accuracy of 81%. The boosted tree classifier performed better than the previously developed ensemble classifier. Conclusion: Here we presented promising results which show that a boosted tree analysis on MDC images is a method that could be used as an adjunct to colposcopy and would result in greater diagnostic accuracy compared to existing methods.";2017;10.5220/0006148900850091
J;Deep Tissue Optical and Optoacoustic Molecular Imaging Technologies for Pre-Clinical Research and Drug Discovery;For centuries, biological discoveries were based on optical imaging, in particular microscopy but also several chromophoric assays and photographic approaches. With the recent emergence of methods appropriate for bio-marker in vivo staining, such as bioluminescence, fluorescent molecular probes and proteins, as well as nanoparticle-based targeted agents, significant attention has been shifted toward in vivo interrogations of different dynamic biological processes at the molecular level. This progress has been largely supported by the development of advanced tomographic imaging technologies suitable for obtaining volumetric visualization of bio-marker distributions in small animals at a whole-body or whole-organ scale, an imaging frontier that is not accessible by the existing tissue-sectioning microscopic techniques due to intensive light scattering beyond the depth of a few hundred microns. Major examples of such recently developed optical imaging modalities are reviewed here, including bioluminescence tomography (BLT), fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT), and optical projection tomography (OPT). The pharmaceutical imaging community has quickly appropriated itself of these novel forms of optical imaging, since they come with very compelling advantages, such as quantitative three-dimensional capabilities, direct correlation to the biological cultures, easiness and cost-effectiveness of use, and the use of safe non-ionizing radiation. Some multi-modality approaches, combining light with other imaging modalities such as X-Ray CT or MRI, giving the ability to acquire both an optical contrast reconstruction along with a hi-fidelity anatomical images, are also reviewed. A separate section is devoted to the hybrid imaging techniques based on the optoacoustic phenomenon, such as multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), which are poised to leverage the traditional contrast and specificity advantages of optical spectrum by delivering an ever powerful set of capabilities, including real-time operation and high spatial resolution, not affected by the scattering nature of biological tissues.;2012;10.2174/138920112799436258
J;In vivo Photoacoustic Spectroscopic Imaging of Hemoglobin Derivatives in Thermally Damaged Tissue;Photoacoustic (PA) spectroscopic measurement was performed for thermally damaged skin in a rat in vivo to analyze hemoglobin derivatives in the tissue. We observed PA signals at around 500 and 633 nm, which are center wavelengths of methemoglobin (MetHb) absorption peaks, at depths corresponding the uppermost dermis (similar to 0.16 mm) and hair follicles (similar to 0.62 mm), indicating formation of MetHb in these tissue regions. By scanning a PA detector on the tissue, two-dimensional PA images (tomograms) were produced. Subtraction imaging technique was used for multispectral PA tomograms to analyze specific components of hemoglobin derivatives in the tissue, by which the contrast of oxyhemogobin (HbO(2))-associated PA signal has been improved and the distribution of PA signal that seems to reflect the concentration of MetHb has been visualized.

C;In vivo light fluence correction for determination of tissue absorption coefficient using MultiSpectral Optoacoustic Tomography;Optoacoustic Tomography is a fast developing imaging modality, combining the high resolution and penetration depth of ultrasound detection with the high contrast available from optical absorption in tissue. The spectral profile of near infrared excitation light used in optoacoustic tomography instruments is modified by absorption and scattering as it propagates deep into biological tissue. The resulting images therefore provide only qualitative insight into the distribution of tissue chromophores. Knowledge of the spectral profile of excitation light across the mouse is needed for accurate determination of the absorption coefficient in vivo. Under the conditions of constant Griineisen parameter and accurate knowledge of the light fluence, a linear relationship should exist between the initial optoacoustic pressure amplitude and the tissue absorption coefficient. Using data from a commercial optoacoustic tomography system, we implemented an iterative optimization based on the 6-Eddington approximation to the Radiative Transfer Equation to derive a light fluence map within a given object. We segmented the images based on the positions of phantom inclusions, or mouse organs, and used known scattering coefficients for initialization. Performing the fluence correction in simple phantoms allowed the expected linear relationship between recorded and independently measured absorption coefficients to be retrieved and spectral coloring to be compensated. For in vivo data, the correction resulted in an enhancement of signal intensities in deep tissues. This improved our ability to visualize organs at depth (> 5mm). Future work will aim to perform the optimization without data normalization and explore the need for methodology that enables routine implementation for in vivo imaging.;2016;10.1117/12.2210958
C;Confocal mosaicing microscopy of basal cell carcinomas ex vivo: progress in digital staining to simulate histology-like appearance;Confocal mosaicing microscopy enables rapid imaging of large areas of fresh tissue, without the processing that is necessary for conventional histology. Using acridine orange (1 milliMolar, 20 seconds) to stain nuclei, basal cell carcinomas were detected in fluorescence confocal mosaics of Mohs surgical excisions with sensitivity of 96.6% and specificity of 89.2%. A possible barrier toward clinical acceptance is that confocal mosaics are based on a single mode of contrast and appear in grayscale, whereas histology is based on two (hematoxylin for nuclei, eosin for cellular cytoplasm and dermis) and appears purple-and-pink. Toward addressing this barrier, we report progress in developing a multispectral analytical model for digital staining: fluorescence confocal mosaics, which show only nuclei, are digitally stained purple and overlaid on reflectance confocal mosaics, which show only cellular cytoplasm and dermis, and digitally stained pink, to mimic the appearance of histology. Comparison of digitally stained confocal mosaics by our Mohs surgeon to the corresponding Mohs histology shows good correlation for normal and tumor detail. Digitally stained confocal mosaicing microscopy may allow direct examination of freshly excised tissue and serve as an adjunct for rapid pathology at-the-bedside.;2011;10.1117/12.873601
C;Fluorescence and reflectance monitoring of human cervical tissue in vivo - A case study;An imaging spectrograph, designed and built by Science and Technology International (STI), and a point monitoring system, developed at the Lund Institute of Technology, have been used to measure the fluorescence and reflectance of cervical tissue in vivo. The instruments have been employed in a clinical trial in Vilnius, Lithuania, where 111 patients were examined. Patients were initially screened by Pap smear, examined by colposcopy and a tissue sampling procedure was performed. Detailed histopathological assessments were performed on the biopsies, and these assessments were correlated with spectra and images. The results of the spectroscopic investigations are illustrated by a thorough discussion of a case study for one of the patients, suggesting that the techniques are useful in the management of cervical malignancies.;2003;10.1117/12.479495
J;Vessel Imaging with Viable Tumor Analysis for Quantification of Tumor Angiogenesis;"Imaging of tumor microvasculature has become an important tool for studying angiogenesis and monitoring antiangiogenic therapies. Ultrasmall paramagnetic iron oxide contrast agents for indirect imaging of vasculature offer a method for quantitative measurements of vascular biomarkers such as vessel size index, blood volume, and vessel density. Here, this technique is validated with direct comparisons to ex vivo micro-CT angiography and histologic vessel measurements, showing significant correlations between in vivo vascular MRI measurements and ex vivo structural vessel measurements. The sensitivity of the MRI vascular parameters is also demonstrated, in combination with a multispectral analysis technique for segmenting tumor tissue to restrict the analysis to viable tumor tissue and exclude regions of necrosis. It is shown that this viable tumor segmentation increases sensitivity for detection of significant effects on blood volume and vessel density by two antiangiogenic therapeutics (anti-VEGF and anti-neuropilin-1) on an HM7 colorectal tumor model. Anti-VEGF reduced blood volume by 36 +/- 3% (P < 0.0001) and vessel density by 52 +/- 3% (P < 0.0001) at 48 h posttreatment; the effects of anti-neuropilin-1 were roughly half as strong with a reduction in blood volume of 18 +/- 6% (P < 0.05) and a reduction in vessel density of 33 +/- 5% (P < 0.05) at 48 h posttreatment.

C;Model-based recovery of histological parameters from multi-spectral images of the colon;"Colon cancer alters the macroarchitecture of the colon tissue. Common changes include angiogenesis and the distortion of the tissue collagen matrix. Such changes affect the colon colouration. This paper presents the principles of a novel optical imaging method capable of extracting parameters depicting histological quantities of the colon. The method is based on a computational, physics-based model of light interaction with tissue. The colon structure is represented by three layers: mucosa, submucosa and muscle layer. Optical properties of the layers are defined by molar concentration and absorption coefficients of haemoglobins; the size and density of collagen fibres; the thickness of the layer and the refractive indexes of collagen and the medium. Using the entire histologically plausible ranges for these parameters, a cross-reference is created computationally between the histological quantities and the associated spectra. The output of the model was compared to experimental data acquired in vivo from 57 histologically confirmed normal and abnormal tissue samples and histological parameters were extracted. The model produced spectra which match well the measured data, with the corresponding spectral parameters being well within histologically plausible ranges. Parameters extracted for the abnormal spectra showed the increase in blood volume fraction and changes in collagen pattern characteristic of the colon cancer., The spectra extracted from multi-spectral images of ex-vivo colon including adenocarcinoma show the characteristic features associated with normal and abnormal colon tissue. These findings suggest that it should be possible to compute histological quantities for the colon from the multi-spectral images.";2005;10.1117/12.595629
J;Intraoperative measurement of bowel oxygen saturation using a multispectral imaging laparoscope;Intraoperative monitoring of tissue oxygen saturation (StO(2)) has potentially important applications in procedures such as organ transplantation or colorectal surgery, where successful reperfusion affects the viability and integrity of repaired tissues. In this paper a liquid crystal tuneable filter-based multispectral imaging (MSI) laparoscope is described. Motion-induced image misalignments are reduced, using feature-based registration, before regression of the tissue reflectance spectra to calculate relative quantities of oxy- and deoxyhaemoglobin. The laparoscope was validated in vivo, during porcine abdominal surgery, by making parallel MSI and blood gas measurements of the small bowel vasculature. Ischaemic conditions were induced by local occlusion of the mesenteric arcade and monitored using the system. The MSI laparoscope was capable of measuring StO(2) over a wide range (30-100%) with a temporal error of +/- 7.5%. The imager showed sensitivity to spatial changes in StO(2) during dynamic local occlusions, as well as tracking the recovery of tissues post-occlusion.

C;Multispectral Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy combined with Optical Coherence Tomography for simultaneous in vivo mouse retinal imaging;A compact, non-invasive multi-modal system has been developed for in vivo mouse retina imaging. It is configured for simultaneously detecting green and red fluorescent protein signals with scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) back-scattered light from the SLO illumination beam, and depth information about different retinal layers by means of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). Simultaneous assessment of retinal characteristics with different modalities can provide a wealth of information about the structural and functional changes in the retinal neural tissue and chorio-retinal vasculature in vivo. Additionally, simultaneous acquisition of multiple channels facilitates analysis of the data of different modalities by automatic temporal and structural co-registration. As an example of the instrument's performance we imaged the retina of a mouse with constitutive expression of GFP in microglia cells (Cx3cr1(GFP/+)), and which also expressed the red fluorescent protein mCherry in Miller glial cells by means of adeno-associated virus delivery (AAV2) of an mCherry cDNA driven by the GFAP (glial fibrillary acid protein) promoter.;2015;10.1117/12.2080468
C;The use of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in wound healing;A hyperspectral imaging system (Hsl), described previously, was utilized to evaluate and monitor wounds and their healing surgery and post-operatively. Briefly, the system consists of a DLP (R) based spectral light modulator providing active spectral illumination that is synchronized with a digital focal plan array for collecting spectroscopic images that are processed for mapping the percentage of oxyhemoglobin at each detector pixel non-invasively and at near video rates similar to 8 chemically encode images per second. Methods: Ten patients were imaged over a period of two weeks and two patients were imaged twice. Patients were taken to the operating room for soft tissue and bone debridement of the foot following and infection. Hsl was utilized during surgery by imaging patients before, and after soft tissue and bone debridement of the foot, and -2 days postoperative, Hsl images were collected when the patient returned to surgery to have the wound re-debrided, possible closure or treatment with negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) utilizing V.A.C.(R) Therapy. Results: The bases of each wound were measured, and showed to have tissue oxygenation as low as 32.48 % HbO(2) prior to amputation. Tissue area that was clinically determined as having poor perfusion was on average 44.59 % HbO(2) while areas of good perfusion were 60.65 % HbO(2). Wounds that were considered at risk for amputations had a tissue oxygenation of 51.97 % HbO(2). Tissue oxygenation was noticed to increase after debridement, and 5 minutes after NPWT treatment. NPWT was noted to improve tissue oxygenation by 6% within 15 minutes, and 18% after 48 hours of continuous use. Conclusion: The present study suggests the level of tissue health is directly related to tissue oxygenation levels within the micro vasculature. Results show low tissue oxygenation indicating poor tissue health and compared well with standard clinical methods. This technology may assist surgeons in identifying well oxygenated tissue in which is not possible with visual evaluation alone.;2014;10.1117/12.2041841
J;Multispectral measurement of contrast in tissue-mimicking phantoms in near-infrared spectral range of 650 to 1600 nm;In order to identify the optimal imaging conditions for the highest spatial contrast in biological tissue, we explored the properties of a tissue-mimicking phantom as a function of the wavelengths in a broad range of near-infrared spectra (650 to 1600 nm). Our customized multispectral hardware, which featured a scanning transmission microscope and imaging spectrographs equipped with silicon and InGaAs charge-coupled diode array detectors, allowed for direct comparison of the Michelson contrast obtained from a phantom composed of a honeycomb grid, Intralipid, and India ink. The measured contrast depended on the size of the grid, luminance, and the wavelength of measurements. We demonstrated that at low thickness of the phantom, a reasonable contrast of the objects can be achieved at any wavelength between 700 and 1400 nm and between 1500 and 1600 nm. At larger thicknesses, such contrast can be achieved mostly between 1200 and 1350 nm. These results suggest that distinguishing biological features in deep tissue and developing contrast agents for in vivo may benefit from imaging in this spectral range.

J;A four-dimensional snapshot hyperspectral video-endoscope for bio-imaging applications;Hyperspectral imaging has proven significance in bio-imaging applications and it has the ability to capture up to several hundred images of different wavelengths offering relevant spectral signatures. To use hyperspectral imaging for in vivo monitoring and diagnosis of the internal body cavities, a snapshot hyperspectral video-endoscope is required. However, such reported systems provide only about 50 wavelengths. We have developed a four-dimensional snapshot hyperspectral video-endoscope with a spectral range of 400-1000 nm, which can detect 756 wavelengths for imaging, significantly more than such systems. Capturing the three-dimensional datacube sequentially gives the fourth dimension. All these are achieved through a flexible two-dimensional to one-dimensional fiber bundle. The potential of this custom designed and fabricated compact biomedical probe is demonstrated by imaging phantom tissue samples in reflectance and fluorescence imaging modalities. It is envisaged that this novel concept and developed probe will contribute significantly towards diagnostic in vivo biomedical imaging in the near future.;2016;10.1038/srep24044
J;Multispectral digital colposcopy for in vivo detection of cervical cancer;We present a multispectral digital colposcope (MDC) to measure multispectral autofluorescence and reflectance images of the cervix by using an inexpensive color CCD camera. The diagnostic ability of the MDC was evaluated by application of MDC spectral response to fluorescence and reflectance spectra measured from a large clinical trial. High diagnostic performance was achieved by use of only two excitation wavelengths: 330 and 440 nm. Good quality autofluorescence images of the human cervix were acquired in vivo with the MDC. Automated diagnostic algorithms correctly identified CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) lesions from MDC fluorescence images. The MDC has the potential to provide a cost-effective alternative to standard colposcopy and better direction of biopsies. (C) 2003 Optical Society of America.;2003;10.1364/OE.11.001223
J;Nerve-Highlighting Fluorescent Contrast Agents for Image-Guided Surgery;Nerve damage is the major morbidity of many surgeries, resulting in chronic pain, loss of function, or both. The sparing of nerves during surgical procedures is a vexing problem because surrounding tissue often obscures them. To date, systemically administered nerve-highlighting contrast agents that can be used for nerve-sparing image-guided surgery have not been reported. In the current study, physicochemical and optical properties of 4,4'-[(2-methoxy-1,4-phenylene) di-(1E)-2,1-ethenediyl] bis-benzenamine (BMB) and a newly synthesized, red-shifted derivative 4-[(1E)-2-[4-[(1E)-2-[4-aminophenyl] ethenyl]-3-methoxyphenyl] ethenyl]-benzonitrile (GE3082) were characterized in vitro and in vivo. Both agents crossed the blood-nerve barrier and blood-brain barrier and rendered myelinated nerves fluorescent after a single systemic injection. Although both BMB and GE3082 also exhibited significant uptake in white adipose tissue, GE3082 underwent a hypsochromic shift in adipose tissue that provided a means to eliminate the unwanted signal using hyperspectral deconvolution. Dose and kinetic studies were performed in mice to determine the optimal dose and drug-imaging interval. The results were confirmed in rat and pig, with the latter used to demonstrate, for the first time, simultaneous fluorescence imaging of blood vessels and nerves during surgery using the FLARE (TM) (Fluorescence-Assisted Resection and Exploration) imaging system. These results lay the foundation for the development of ideal nerve-highlighting fluorophores for image-guided surgery.;2011;10.2310/7290.2010.00026
J;Identifying molecular contributors to autofluorescence of neoplastic and normal colon sections using excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging;Autofluorescence, the endogenous fluorescence present in cells and tissues, has historically been considered a nuisance in biomedical imaging. Many endogenous fluorophores, specifically, collagen, elastin, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), are found throughout the human body. In fluorescence imaging scenarios, these signals can be prohibitive as they can outcompete signals introduced for diagnostic purposes. However, autofluorescence also contains information that has diagnostic value. Recent advances in hyperspectral imaging have allowed the acquisition of significantly more data in a shorter time period by scanning the excitation spectra of fluorophores. The reduced acquisition time and increased signal- to-noise ratio allow for separation of significantly more fluorophores than previously possible. We propose to utilize excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging of autofluorescence to differentiate neoplastic lesions from surrounding non-neoplastic normal tissue. The spectra of isolated autofluorescent molecules are obtained using a custom inverted microscope (TE-2000, Nikon Instruments) with an Xe arc lamp and thin-film tunable filter array (VersaChrome, Semrock, Inc.). Scans utilize excitation wavelengths from 360 to 550 nm in 5-nm increments. The resultant molecule-specific spectra are used to analyze hyperspectral image stacks from normal and neoplastic colorectal tissues. Due to a limited number of samples, neoplastic tissues examined here are a pool of both colorectal adenocarcinoma and adenomatous polyps. The hyperspectral images are analyzed with ENVI software and custom MATLAB scripts, including linear spectral unmixing. Initial results indicate the ability to separate signals of endogenous fluorophores and measure the relative concentrations of fluorophores among healthy and diseased states, in this case, normal colon versus neoplastic colon. These results suggest pathology-specific changes to endogenous fluorophores can be detected using excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging. Future work will focus on expanding the library of pure molecules, exploring histogram distance metrics as a means for identifying deviations in spectral signatures, and examining more defined disease states.

J;Non-Ionizing Label-Free Photoacoustic Imaging of Bones;X-ray based radiography, the main modality for diagnostic imaging of bone structures and fractures, provides sensitive images, but it inherently involves potentially harmful X-ray exposure. As non-ionizing alternatives, various optical imaging methods have been explored. Here, we demonstrate non-ionizing, label-free, multispectral photoacoustic (PA) imaging of bones in small animals in vivo. in situ. and ex vivo. Using near-infrared light excitation and acoustic detection, the spine and ribs were successfully visualized in high-resolution PA images. PA 3D volume images of the spine and ribs were clearly visualized together with blood vessels and several organs including the spleen, liver, and cecum, without using any exogenous contrast agent nor ionizing radiation. Quantification results of multispectral PA signals from blood vessels and bones were in good agreement with their absorption coefficients. Further, a rib fracture was photoacoustically imaged. Our results demonstrate PA imaging's potential as a non-ionizing and label-free technique for imaging bone tissues.;2020;10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3020559
J;Intraoperative visualization of cerebral oxygenation using hyperspectral image data: a two-dimensional mapping method;Superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (MCA) bypass is an important technique for cerebrovascular reconstruction. Intraoperative hemodynamic imaging is needed to perform cerebrovascular reconstruction safely and effectively. Optical intrinsic signal (OIS) imaging is commonly used for assessing cerebral hemodynamics in experimental studies, because it can provide high-resolution mapping images. However, OIS is not used clinically due to algorithm, instrumentation and spectral resolution limitations. We tested the feasibility of a hyperspectral camera (HSC) for assessment of cortical hemodynamics with spectral imaging of the cerebral cortex in rats and in vivo humans. A hyperspectral camera (HSC) was tested in a rat model of cerebral ischemia (middle cerebral artery occlusion) and during human revascularization surgery (STA-MCA anastomosis). Changes in cortical oxygen saturation were derived from spectral imaging data (400-800 nm) collected by exposing the cortex to Xenon light. Reflected light was sampled using the HSC. The system was then tested intraoperatively during superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery anastomosis procedures. Comparison with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging data was done. During middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats, the HSC technique showed a significant decrease in cortical oxygen saturation in the ischemic hemisphere. In clinical cases, the cortical oxygen saturation was increased after STA-MCA anastomosis, which agreed with the SPECT imaging data. Continuous collection of imaging spectroscopic data is feasible and may provide reliable quantification of the hemodynamic responses in the brain. The HSC system may be useful for monitoring intraoperative changes in cortical surface hemodynamics during revascularization procedures in humans.;2014;10.1007/s11548-014-0989-9
J;Macroscopic-imaging technique for subsurface quantification of near-infrared markers during surgery;Obtaining accurate quantitative information on the concentration and distribution of fluorescent markers lying at a depth below the surface of optically turbid media, such as tissue, is a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a fluorescence reconstruction technique based on a diffusion light transport model that can be used during surgery, including guiding resection of brain tumors, for depth-resolved quantitative imaging of near-infrared fluorescent markers. Hyperspectral fluorescence images are used to compute a topographic map of the fluorophore distribution, which yields structural and optical constraints for a three-dimensional subsequent hyperspectral diffuse fluorescence reconstruction algorithm. Using the model fluorophore Alexa Fluor 647 and brain-like tissue phantoms, the technique yielded estimates of fluorophore concentration within +/- 25% of the true value to depths of 5 to 9 mm, depending on the concentration. The approach is practical for integration into a neurosurgical fluorescence microscope and has potential to further extend fluorescence-guided resection using objective and quantified metrics of the presence of residual tumor tissue.

J;Application of ultrafast gold luminescence to measuring the instrument response function for multispectral multiphoton fluorescence lifetime imaging;When performing multiphoton fluorescence lifetime imaging in multiple spectral emission channels, an instrument response function must be acquired in each channel if accurate measurements of complex fluorescence decays are to be performed. Although this can be achieved using the reference reconvolution technique, it is difficult to identify suitable fluorophores with a mono-exponential fluorescence decay across a broad emission spectrum. We present a solution to this problem by measuring the IRF using the ultrafast luminescence from gold nanorods. We show that ultrafast gold nanorod luminescence allows the IRF to be directly obtained in multiple spectral channels simultaneously across a wide spectral range. We validate this approach by presenting an analysis of multispectral autofluorescence FLIM data obtained from human skin ex vivo. (C) 2011 Optical Society of America;2011;10.1364/OE.19.013848
J;Hyperspectral mapping of the response of grapevine cultivars to Plasmopara viticola infection at the tissue scale;"Resistance of grapevine to Plasmopara viticola is associated with the hypersensitive reaction, accumulation of stilbenoids, and formation of callose depositions. Spectral characterization of infected leaf tissue of cvs 'Regent' and 'Solaris' with resistance genes Rpv 3-1 and Rpv 10 and Rpv 3-3, respectively, suggested that resistance is not dependent on large-scale necrotization of host tissue. Reactions of the resistant cultivars and a reference susceptible to P. viticola were studied using hyperspectral imaging (range 400-1000 nm) at the tissue level and microscopic techniques. Resistance of both cultivars was incomplete and allowed pathogen reproduction. Spectral vegetation indices characterized the host response to pathogen invasion; the vitality of infected and necrotic leaf tissue differed significantly. Resistance depended on local accumulation of polyphenols in response to haustorium formation and was more effective for cv. 'Solaris'. Although hypersensitive reaction of some cells prevented colonization of palisade parenchyma, resistance was not associated with extensive necrotization of tissue, and the biotrophic pathogen survived localized death of penetrated host cells. Hyperspectral imaging was suitable to characterize and differentiate the resistance reactions of grapevine cultivars by mapping of the cellular response to pathogen attack on the tissue level and yields useful information on host-pathogen interactions. The physiological reaction of grapevine tissue to Plasmopara viticolainfection was mapped in vivoby hyperspectral microscopy.

J;Multi-Aspect Optoacoustic Imaging of Breast Tumors under Chemotherapy with Exogenous and Endogenous Contrasts: Focus on Apoptosis and Hypoxia;Breast cancer is a complex tumor type involving many biological processes. Most chemotherapeutic agents exert their antitumoral effects by rapid induction of apoptosis. Another main feature of breast cancer is hypoxia, which may drive malignant progression and confer resistance to various forms of therapy. Thus, multi-aspect imaging of both tumor apoptosis and oxygenation in vivo would be of enormous value for the effective evaluation of therapy response. Herein, we demonstrate the capability of a hybrid imaging modality known as multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) to provide high-resolution, simultaneous imaging of tumor apoptosis and oxygenation, based on both the exogenous contrast of an apoptosis-targeting dye and the endogenous contrast of hemoglobin. MSOT imaging was applied on mice bearing orthotopic 4T1 breast tumors before and following treatment with doxorubicin. Apoptosis was monitored over time by imaging the distribution of xPLORE-APOFL750 (c), a highly sensitive poly-caspase binding apoptotic probe, within the tumors. Oxygenation was monitored by tracking the distribution of oxy- and deoxygenated hemoglobin within the same tumor areas. Doxorubicin treatment induced an increase in apoptosis-depending optoacoustic signal of xPLORE-APOFL750 (c) at 24 h after treatment. Furthermore, our results showed spatial correspondence between xPLORE-APO750 (c) and deoxygenated hemoglobin. In vivo apoptotic status of the tumor tissue was independently verified by ex vivo fluorescence analysis. Overall, our results provide a rationale for the use of MSOT as an effective tool for simultaneously investigating various aspects of tumor pathophysiology and potential effects of therapeutic regimes based on both endogenous and exogenous molecular contrasts.;2021;10.3390/biomedicines9111696
J;Quantitative multi-spectral oxygen saturation measurements independent of tissue optical properties;Imaging of tissue oxygenation is important in several applications associated with patient care. Optical sensing is commonly applied for assessing oxygen saturation but is often restricted to local measurements or else it requires spectral and spatial information at the expense of time. Many methods proposed so far require assumptions on the properties of measured tissue. In this study we investigated a computational method that uses only multispectral information and quantitatively computes tissue oxygen saturation independently of tissue optical properties. The method is based on linear transformations of measurements in three isosbestic points. We investigated the ideal isosbestic point combination out of six isosbestic points available for measurement in the visible and near-infrared region that enable accurate oxygen saturation computation. We demonstrate this method on controlled tissue mimicking phantoms having different optical properties and validated the measurements using a gas analyzer. A mean error of 2.9 +/- 2.8% O(2)Sat was achieved. Finally, we performed pilot studies in tissues in-vivo by measuring dynamic changes in fingers subjected to vascular occlusion, the vasculature of mouse ears and exposed mouse organs. [GRAPHICS] Selected steps of spectral transformations applied to oxygenation spectra. The original reflectance spectrum M(lambda) is transformed in step 1 to overlap with reference spectra (grey) in three isosbestic points, resulting in M ''(lambda). In step 2, the gradient of M ''(lambda) is computed resulting in M-grad ''(lambda), which can be used for quantitative oxygenation computation.;2016;10.1002/jbio.201400092
C;A hyperspectral fluorescence imaging system for biological applications;We are developing a hyperspectral imaging system aimed at imaging fluorescent molecules in two different contexts: In vivo 3-D molecular imaging of mice and multi-fluorophore imaging of 2-D tissue samples. The main concept is to add high resolution spectral information to the intensity data to improve imaging capabilities. The system is based on an imaging spectrograph, ImSpector, coupled to a CCD camera. The system has been characterized and calibrated. Spectral imaging of tissue samples stained with fluorescent dyes has been performed to validate the principle and the 2-D imaging capabilities. Near infrared 3-D in vivo fluorescence tomography is based on the intensity and spatial distribution of the fluorescent light reaching the surface of the animal as a function of the localized external excitation position. Based on the fact that the absorption coefficient of tissue is wavelength dependent, the measured spectrum of the fluorescent light will provide additional information, thus allowing an improvement of the 3-D reconstruction. By using solely spectral data we have demonstrated the capability of determining the 3-D position of a localized source within a red meat phantom.;2004;
C;Interventional multispectral photoacoustic imaging with a clinical linear array ultrasound probe for guiding nerve blocks;Accurate identification of tissue structures such as nerves and blood vessels is critically important for interventional procedures such as nerve blocks. Ultrasound imaging is widely used as a guidance modality to visualize anatomical structures in real-time. However, identification of nerves and small blood vessels can be very challenging, and accidental intra-neural or intra-vascular injections can result in significant complications. Multi-spectral photoacoustic imaging can provide high sensitivity and specificity for discriminating hemoglobin-and lipid-rich tissues. However, conventional surface-illumination-based photoacoustic systems suffer from limited sensitivity at large depths. In this study, for the first time, an interventional multispectral photoacoustic imaging (IMPA) system was used to image nerves in a swine model in vivo. Pulsed excitation light with wavelengths in the ranges of 750 - 900 nm and 1150 - 1300 nm was delivered inside the body through an optical fiber positioned within the cannula of an injection needle. Ultrasound waves were received at the tissue surface using a clinical linear array imaging probe. Co-registered B-mode ultrasound images were acquired using the same imaging probe. Nerve identification was performed using a combination of B-mode ultrasound imaging and electrical stimulation. Using a linear model, spectral-unmixing of the photoacoustic data was performed to provide image contrast for oxygenated and de-oxygenated hemoglobin, water and lipids. Good correspondence between a known nerve location and a lipid-rich region in the photoacoustic images was observed. The results indicate that IMPA is a promising modality for guiding nerve blocks and other interventional procedures. Challenges involved with clinical translation are discussed.;2016;10.1117/12.2209047
J;Quantifying the optical properties and chromophore concentrations of turbid media by chemometric analysis of hyperspectral diffuse reflectance data collected using a fourier interferometric imaging system;A non-contact Fourier transform interferometric imaging system was used to collect hyperspectral images of the steady-state diffuse reflectance from a point source in turbid media for the spectral range of 550-850 nm. Steady-state diffuse reflectance profiles were generated from the hyperspectral images, and partial least-squares (PLS) regression was performed on the diffuse reflectance profiles to quantify absorption (mu (alpha)) and reduced scattering (mu (s)') properties of turbid media. The feasibility of using PLS regression to predict optical properties was examined for two different sets of spatially-resolved diffuse reflectance data. One set of data was collected from 40 turbid phantoms, while the second set was generated by convolving Monte Carlo simulations with the instrument response of the imaging system. Study results show that PLS prediction of mu (alpha) and mu (s)' was accurate to within +/-8% and +/-5%, respectively, when the model was trained on turbid phantom data. Moreover, PLS prediction of optical properties was considerably faster and more efficient than direct least-squares fitting of spatially-resolved profiles. When the PLS model was trained on Monte Carlo simulated data and subsequently used to predict mu (alpha) and mu (s)' from the diffuse reflectance of turbid phantom, the percent accuracies degraded to +/-12% and +/-5%, respectively. These accuracy values are applicable to homogenous, semi-infinite turbid phantoms with optical property ranges comparable to tissues.;2001;10.1366/0003702011952938
J;Tumor detection of the thyroid and salivary glands using hyperspectral imaging and deep learning;The performance of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for tumor detection is investigated in ex-vivo specimens from the thyroid (N= 200) and salivary glands (N= 16) from 82 patients. Tissues were imaged with HSI in broadband reflectance and autofluorescence modes. For comparison, the tissues were imaged with two fluorescent dyes. Additionally, HSI was used to synthesize three-band RGB multiplex images to represent the human-eye response and Gaussian RGBs, which are referred to as HSI-synthesized RGB images. Using histological ground truths, deep learning algorithms were developed for tumor detection. For the classification of thyroid tumors, HSI-synthesized RGB images achieved the best performance with an AUC score of 0.90. In salivary glands, HSI had the best performance with 0.92 AUC score. This study demonstrates that HSI could aid surgeons and pathologists in detecting tumors of the thyroid and salivary glands.

J;Quantitative Vibrational Imaging by Hyperspectral Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy and Multivariate Curve Resolution Analysis;Spectroscopic imaging has been an increasingly critical approach for unveiling specific molecules in biological environments. Toward this goal, we demonstrate hyperspectral stimulated Raman loss (SRL) imaging by intrapulse spectral scanning through a femtosecond pulse shaper. The hyperspectral stack of SRL images is further analyzed by a multivariate curve resolution (MCR) method to reconstruct quantitative concentration images for each individual component and retrieve the corresponding vibrational Raman spectra. Using these methods, we demonstrate quantitative mapping of dimethyl sulfoxide concentration in aqueous solutions and in fat tissue. Moreover, MCR is performed on SRL images of breast cancer cells to generate maps of principal chemical components along with their respective vibrational spectra. These results show the great capability and potential of hyperspectral SRL microscopy for quantitative imaging of complicated biomolecule mixtures through resolving overlapped Raman bands.;2013;10.1021/ac3019119
C;Machine learning-assisted hyperspectral analysis of plasmonic contrast agent microbiodistribution with single-particle sensitivity and sub-cellular resolution;Nanoparticles have been explored extensively as potential biomedical imaging and therapeutic agents. One critical aspect of in vivo nanoparticle use is the characterization of biodistribution profiles. Such studies improve our understanding of particle uptake, specificity, and clearance mechanisms. Currently, the most prevalent nanoparticle biodistribution methods provide either aspatial quantification of whole-organ particle accumulation or nanometer-resolution images of uptake in single cells. Few existing techniques are well-suited to study particle uptake on the micron to millimeter scales relevant to sub-tissue physiology. Here we demonstrate a new method called Hyperspectral Microscopy with Adaptive Detection (HSM-AD) that uses machine learning classification of hyperspectral dark-field images to study interactions between tissues and administered nanoparticles. This label-free, non-destructive method enables quantitative particle identification in histological sections and detailed observations of sub-organ accumulation patterns consistent with organ-specific clearance mechanisms, particle size, and the molecular specificity of the nanoparticle surface. Unlike studies with electron microscopy, HSM-AD is readily applied for large fields of view. HSM-AD achieves excellent detection sensitivity (99.4%) and specificity (99.7%) and can identify single nanoparticles. To demonstrate HSM-AD's potential for novel nanoparticle uptake studies, we collected the first data on the sub-organ localization of large gold nanorods (LGNRs) in mice. We also observed differences in particle accumulation and localization patterns in tumors as a function of conjugated molecular targeting moieties. Thus, HSM-AD affords new degrees of detail for the study of nanoparticle uptake at physiological scales. HSM-AD may offer an auxiliary or alternative approach to study the biodistribution profiles of existing and novel nanoparticles.;2017;10.1117/12.2254117

Besides, by the method of data mining, the relationships between diseases and the data including the spectrum, image or synentropy were established. This technology provided more information for the disease detection clinically which can reflect accurately the physiological, biochemical and pathological status and the variation of the body surface tissues, by which both the cost of the equipment and the operation steps can be reduced.;2011;10.3964/j.issn.1000-0593(2011)01-0201-04
J;Metallic Implant Geometry and Susceptibility Estimation Using Multispectral B-0 Field Maps;Purpose: To estimate the susceptibility and the geometry of metallic implants from multispectral imaging (MSI) information, to separate the metal implant region from the surrounding signal loss region. Theory and Methods: The susceptibility map of signal-void regions is estimated from MSI B-0 field maps using total variation ( TV) regularized inversion. Voxels with susceptibility estimates above a predetermined threshold are identified as metal. The accuracy of the estimated susceptibility and implant geometry was evaluated in simulations, phantom, and in vivo experiments. Results: The proposed method provided more accurate susceptibility estimation compared with a previous method without TV regularization, in both simulations and phantom experiments. In the phantom experiment where the actual implant was 40% of the signal-void region, the mean estimated susceptibility was close to the susceptibility in literature, and the precision and recall of the estimated geometry was 85% and 93%. In vivo studies in subjects with hip implants also demonstrated that the proposed method can distinguish implants from surrounding low-signal tissues, such as cortical bone. Conclusion: The proposed method can improve the delineation of metallic implant geometry by distinguishing metal voxels from artificial signal voids and low-signal tissues by estimating the susceptibility maps.

J;Real-Time Fluorescence Tracking of Protoporphyrin Incorporated Thermosensitive Hydrogel and Its Drug Release in Vivo;Fluorescence imaging in vivo will pave an important way for the evaluation of biomaterials. The major advantage of fluorescence imaging compared to other imaging modalities is the possibility of tracking two or more fluorescence probes simultaneously with multispectral fluorescence imaging. It is essential to elucidate the location, erosion, drug release and resection of implanted biomaterials in vivo. Herein, a thermosensitive hydrogel with a protoporphyrin core based on a PEG and PCL copolymer (PCL-PEG-PPOR-PEG-PCL) was synthesized by ring-opening polymerization using protoporphyrin as a fluorescence tag. The optical properties of the hydrogel were investigated by UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy in vitro and by fluorescence imaging system in vivo. The hydrogel erosion and drug delivery in vivo were monitored and tracked by multispectral fluorescence imaging system in nude mice. The results show that the thermosensitive hydrogel exhibits fluorescence and injectability in vivo with good biocompatibility. Through the modality of fluorescence imaging, the status of the hydrogel is reflected in situ in vivo including its location and erosion. Multispectral analysis separates the autofluorescence signals from the specific label and provides the ability to locate the drug and carrier. The protoporphyrin incorporated thermosensitive hydrogel can be a potential visiable biomedical implant for tissue repair or drug delivery.;2016;10.1021/acsami.5b11493
J;Learning Optical Scattering Through Symmetrical Orthogonality Enforced Independent Components for Unmixing Deep Tissue Photoacoustic Signals;Noninvasive mapping of chromophore distribution in deep tissue is highly desired in numerous biomedical applications. Multispectral photoacoustic (PA) imaging fused with linear spectral unmixing is employed to generate 2-D and 3-D maps of tissue chromophores. However, wavelength and depth dependent attenuation of optical fluence leads to nonuniform variations in the spectral behavior of biomolecules affecting the accuracy of conventional linear unmixing methods. To address this, a modified independent component analysis (ICA) model is proposed to construct adaptive and statistically independent components for each chromophore from the given spectral PA data. The model was trained with custom designed multispectral PA imaging simulations consisting of both endogenous (oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin) and exogenous (indocyanine green - ICG) chromophores inside 30 mm deep tissue. End-to-end unsupervised nature of the proposed approach made the process independent of human labeling and outperformed the standard linear spectral unmixing method when tested on a set of simulated phantoms, experimental phantoms, and in vivo mouse imaging data.;2021;10.1109/LSENS.2021.3073927
J;Fluorescence phenomena in nerve-labeling styryl-type dyes;Several classes of diversely substituted styryl type dyes have been synthesized with the goal of extending their expected fluorescent properties as much toward red as possible given the constraint that they maintain drug-like properties and retain high affinity binding to their biological target. We report on the synthesis, optical properties of a series of styryl dyes (d1-d14), and the anomalous photophysical behavior of several of these donor-acceptor pairs separated by long conjugated pi-systems (d7-d10). We further describe an unusual dual emission behavior with two distinct ground state conformers which could be individually excited to locally excited (LE) and twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) excited state in push-pull dye systems (d7, d9 and d10). Additionally, unexpected emission behavior in dye systems d7 and d8 wherein the amino-derivative d7 displayed a dual emission in polar medium while the N,N-dimethyl derivative d8 and other methylated derivatives d12-d14 showed only LE emission but did not show any TICT emission. Based on photophysical and nerve binding studies, we down selected compounds that exhibited the most robust fluorescent staining of nerve tissue sections. These dyes (d7, d9, and d10) were subsequently selected for in vivo fluorescence imaging studies in rodents using the small animal multispectral imaging instrument and the dual-mode laparoscopic instrument developed in-house.

J;Multispectral in vivo three-dimensional optical coherence tomography of human skin;The capability of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to perform optical biopsy of tissues within a depth range of 1 to 2 mm with micron-scale resolution in real time makes it a promising biomedical imaging modality for dermatologic applications. Three highspeed, spectrometer-based frequency-domain OCT systems operating at 800 nm (20,000 A-scans/s), 1060 nm, and 1300 nm (both 47,000 A-scans/s) at comparable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), SNR roll-off with scanning depth, and transverse resolution (<15 mu m) were used to acquire 3-D tomograms of glabrous and hairy human skin in vivo. Images obtained using these three systems were compared in terms of penetration depth, resolution, and contrast. Normal as well as abnormal sites like moles and scar tissue were examined. In this preliminary study, skin pigmentation had little effect on penetration accomplished at three different wavelengths. The epidermis and dermal epidermal junction could be properly delineated using OCT at 800 nm, and this wavelength offered better contrast over the other two wavelength regions. OCT at 1300 nm permits imaging of deeper dermal layers, critical for detecting deeper tumor boundaries and other deeper skin pathologies. The performance at 1060 nm compromises between the other wavelengths in terms of penetration depth and image contrast. (C) 2010 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

C;Multimodal assessment of spatial distribution of drug-tracer uptake by brain tissue after intra-arterial injections;It is challenging to track the rapid changes in drug concentrations after intra-arterial (IA) administration to elucidate the pharmacokinetics of this method of drug delivery. Traditional pharmacokinetic parameters (such as protein binding) that are highly relevant to intravenous (IV) administration do not seem to apply to IA injections. Regional drug delivery is affected by the biomechanics of drug injection, resting blood flow, and local tissue extraction. In-vivo and ex-vivo, optical methods for spatial mapping of drug deposition can assist in visualizing drug distributions and aid in the screening of potential drugs and carrier candidates. We present a multimodal approach for the assessment of drug distribution in postmortem tissue specimens using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, multispectral imaging, and confocal microscopy and demonstrate feasibility of distinguishing route of administration advantages of liposome-dye conjugate delivery. The results of this study suggest that insight on drug dynamics gained by this aggregated approach can be used to help screen and/or optimize potential drug candidates and drug delivery protocols.;2014;10.1117/12.2040634
J;Multispectral opto-acoustic tomography of deep-seated fluorescent proteins in vivo;Fluorescent proteins have become essential reporter molecules for studying life at the cellular and sub-cellular level, re-defining the ways in which we investigate biology. However, because of intense light scattering, most organisms and tissues remain inaccessible to current fluorescence microscopy techniques at depths beyond several hundred micrometres. We describe a multispectral opto-acoustic tomography technique capable of high-resolution visualization of fluorescent proteins deep within highly light-scattering living organisms. The method uses multiwavelength illumination over multiple projections combined with selective-plane opto-acoustic detection for artifact-free data collection. Accurate image reconstruction is enabled by making use of wavelength-dependent light propagation models in tissue. By performing whole-body imaging of two biologically important and optically diffuse model organisms, Drosophila melanogaster pupae and adult zebrafish, we demonstrate the facility to resolve tissue-specific expression of eGFP and mCherrry fluorescent proteins for precise morphological and functional observations in vivo.;2009;10.1038/NPHOTON.2009.98
J;Synthetic data framework to estimate the minimum detectable concentration of contrast agents for multispectral optoacoustic imaging of small animals;The concentrations of contrast agents for optoacoustic imaging of small animals must usually be optimized through extensive pilot experiments on a case-by-case basis. The present work describes a streamlined approach for determining the minimum detectable concentration (MDC) of a contrast agent given experimental conditions and imaging system parameters. The developed Synthetic Data Framework (SDF) allows estimation of MDCs of various contrast agents under different tissue conditions without extensive animal experiments. The SDF combines simulated optoacoustic signals from exogenously administered contrast agents with in vivo experimental signals from background tissue to generate realistic synthetic multispectral optoacoustic images. In this paper, the SDF is validated with in vivo measurements and demonstrates close agreement between SDF synthetic data and experimental data in terms of both image intensity and MDCs. Use of the SDF to estimate MDCs for fluorescent dyes and nanoparticles at different tissue depths and for imaging lesions of different sizes is illustrated.;2019;10.1002/jbio.201900021
J;Differentiation Between Nerve and Adipose Tissue Using Wide-Band (350-1,830 nm) in vivo Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy;Background: Intraoperative nerve localization is of great importance in surgery. In certain procedures, where nerves show visual resemblance to surrounding adipose tissue, this can be particularly challenging for the human eye. An example of such a delicate procedure is thyroid and parathyroid surgery, where iatrogenic injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve can result in transient or permanent vocal problems (0.5-2.0% reported incidence). A camera system, enabling nerve-specific image enhancement, would be useful in preventing such complications. This might be realized with hyperspectral camera technology using silicon (Si) or indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) sensor chips. Methods: As a first step towards such a camera, we evaluated the performance of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy by analysing spectra collected during 18 thyroid and parathyroid resections. We assessed the contrast information present in two different spectral ranges, for respectively Si and InGaAs sensors. Two hundred fifty three in vivo, wide-band diffuse reflectance spectra (350-1,830 nm range, 1 nm resolution) were acquired on 52 tissue spots, including nerve (n-22), muscle (n-12), and adipose tissue (n-18). We extracted 36 features from these spectroscopic data: 18 gradients and 18 amplitude differences at predefined points in the tissue spectra. Best distinctive feature combinations were established using binary logistic regression. Classification performance was evaluated in a cross-validation (CV) approach by leaveone-out (LOO). To generalize nerve recognition applicability, we performed a train-test (TT) validation using the thyroid and parathyroid surgery data for training purposes and carpal tunnel release surgery data (10 nerve spots and 5 adipose spots) for classification purposes. Results: For combinations of two distinctive spectral features, LOO revealed an accuracy of respectively 78% for Si-sensors and 95% for InGaAs-sensors. TT revealed accuracies of respectively 67% and 100%. Conclusions: Using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy we have identified that InGaAs sensors are better suited for automated discrimination between nerves and surrounding adipose tissue than Si sensors.

J;Rapid extraction of skin physiological parameters from hyperspectral images using machine learning;Noninvasive assessment of skin structure using hyperspectral images has been intensively studied in recent years. Due to the high computational cost of the classical methods, such as the inverse Monte Carlo (IMC), much research has been done with the aim of using machine learning (ML) methods to reduce the time required for estimating parameters. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy and the estimation speed of the ML methods for this purpose and compare them to the traditionally used inverse adding-doubling (IAD) algorithm. We trained three models - an artificial neural network (ANN), a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN), and a random forests (RF) model - to predict seven skin parameters. The models were trained on simulated data computed using the adding-doubling algorithm. To improve predictive performance, we introduced a stacked dynamic weighting (SDW) model combining the predictions of all three individually trained models. SDW model was trained by using only a handful of real-world spectra on top of the ANN, CNN and RF models that were trained using simulated data. Models were evaluated based on the estimated parameters' mean absolute error (MAE), considering the surface inclination angle and comparing skin spectra with spectra fitted by the IAD algorithm. On simulated data, the lowest MAE was achieved by the RF model (0.0030), while the SDW model achieved the lowest MAE on in vivo measured spectra (0.0113). The shortest time to estimate parameters for a single spectrum was 93.05 mu s. Results suggest that ML algorithms can produce accurate estimates of human skin optical parameters in near real-time.;;10.1007/s10489-022-04327-0
S;Hyperspectral Imaging of the Hemodynamic and Metabolic States of the Exposed Cortex: Investigating a Commercial Snapshot Solution;Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) systems have the potential to retrieve in vivo hemodynamic and metabolic signals from the exposed cerebral cortex. The use of multiple narrow wavelength bands in the near infrared (NIR) range theoretically allows not only to image brain tissue oxygenation and hemodynamics via mapping of hemoglobin concentration changes, but also to directly quantify cerebral metabolism via measurement of the redox states of mitochondrial cytochrome-c-oxidase (CCO). The aim of this study is to assess the possibility of performing hyperspectral imaging of in vivo cerebral oxyhemoglobin (HbO(2)), deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) and oxidized CCO (oxCCO) using commercially available HSI devices. For this reason, a hyperspectral snapshot solution based on Cubert GmbH technology (S185 FireflEYE camera) has been tested on the exposed cortex of mice during normoxic, hypoxic and hyperoxic conditions. The system allows simultaneous acquisition of 138 wavelength bands between 450 and 998 nm, with spectral sampling and resolution of similar to 4 to 8 nm. From the hyperspectral data, relative changes in concentration of hemoglobin and oxCCO are estimated and hemodynamic and metabolic maps of the imaged cortex are calculated for two different NIR spectral ranges. Spectroscopic analysis at particular regions of interest is also performed, showing typical oxygen-dependent hemodynamic responses. The results highlight some of the potentials of the technology, but also the limitations of the tested commercial solution for such specific application, in particular regarding spatial resolution.;2018;10.1007/978-3-319-91287-5_3
J;Oxygen Nanobubble Tracking by Light Scattering in Single Cells and Tissues;Oxygen nanobubbles (ONBs) have significant potential in targeted imaging and treatment in cancer diagnosis and therapy. Precise localization and tracking of single ONBs is demonstrated based on hyperspectral dark field microscope (HSDFM) to image and track single oxygen nanobubbles in single cells. ONBs were proposed as promising contrast-generating imaging agents due to their strong light scattering generated from nonuniformity of refractive index at the interface. With this powerful platform, we have revealed the trajectories and quantities of ONBs in cells, and demonstrated the relation between the size and diffusion coefficient. We have also evaluated the presence of ONBs in the nucleus with respect to an increase in incubation time and have quantified the uptake in single cells in ex vivo tumor tissues. Our results demonstrate that HSDFM can be a versatile platform to detect and measure cellulosic nanoparticles at the single-cell level and to assess the dynamics and trajectories of this delivery system.;2017;10.1021/acsnano.6b07478
J;In vivo multispectral imaging of the absorption and scattering properties of exposed brain using a digital red-green-blue camera;To evaluate multi-spectral images of the absorption and scattering properties in the cerebral cortex of rat brain, we investigated spectral reflectance images estimated by the Wiener estimation method using a digital red-green-blue camera. A Monte Carlo simulation-based multiple regression analysis for the corresponding spectral absorbance images at nine wavelengths (500, 520, 540, 560, 570, 580, 600, 730, and 760 nm) was then used to specify the absorption and scattering parameters. The spectral images of absorption and reduced scattering coefficients were reconstructed from the absorption and scattering parameters. We performed in vivo experiments on exposed rat brain to confirm the feasibility of this method. The estimated images of the absorption coefficients were dominated by hemoglobin spectra. The estimated images of the reduced scattering coefficients had a broad scattering spectrum, exhibiting a larger magnitude at shorter wavelengths, corresponding to the typical spectrum of brain tissue published in the literature.;2015;10.1007/s10043-015-0048-y
J;Investigation of the quantification of hemoglobin and cytochrome-c-oxidase in the exposed cortex with near-infrared hyperspectral imaging: a simulation study;"Significance: We present a Monte Carlo (MC) computational framework that simulates nearinfrared (NIR) hyperspectral imaging (HSI) aimed at assisting quantification of the in vivo hemodynamic and metabolic states of the exposed cerebral cortex in small animal experiments. This can be done by targeting the NIR spectral signatures of oxygenated (HbO(2)) and deoxygenated (HHb) hemoglobin for hemodynamics as well as the oxidative state of cytochrome-c-oxidase (oxCCO) for measuring tissue metabolism. Aim: The aim of this work is to investigate the performances of HSI for this specific application as well as to assess key factors for the future design and operation of a benchtop system. Approach: The MC framework, based on Mesh-based Monte Carlo (MMC), reproduces a section of the exposed cortex of a mouse from an in vivo image and replicates hyperspectral illumination and detection at multiple NIR wavelengths (up to 121). Results: The results demonstrate: (1) the fitness of the MC framework to correctly simulate hyperspectral data acquisition; (2) the capability of HSI to reconstruct spatial changes in the concentrations of HbO(2), HHb, and oxCCO during a simulated hypoxic condition; (3) that eight optimally selected wavelengths between 780 and 900 nm provide minimal differences in the accuracy of the hyperspectral results, compared to the gold standard of 121 wavelengths; and (4) the possibility to mitigate partial pathlength effects in the reconstructed data and to enhance quantification of the hemodynamic and metabolic responses. Conclusions: The MC framework is proved to be a flexible and useful tool for simulating HSI also for different applications and targets. (C) The Authors.";2020;10.1117/1.JBO.25.4.046001
C;Effect of Formalin Fixing on Chromophore Saliency Maps Derived from Multi-Spectral Macropathology Skin Images;Evaluation of tissue margins and hemodynamics is necessary during macropathology of skin lesions. This study aims to produce saliency maps of skin chromophores from ex-vivo specimens and observe the effect of formalin fixing on the maps. We used a multi-spectral imaging system with narrow-band illumination to capture various skin lesions. Saliency maps were produced with three different methods adapted from the literature by utilizing spectral absorption and absorption slope. Saliency maps derived from fixed and unfixed tissue were registered and subsequently compared in terms of correlation and histogram similarity. Preliminary results show high dissimilarity between maps of fixed and unfixed tissue, highlighting the influence of formalin fixing on hemodynamics, while relative distribution of melanin remained mostly unaffected.;2021;10.1117/12.2581926
J;Spectral Characterization and Unmixing of Intrinsic Contrast in Intact Normal and Diseased Gastric Tissues Using Hyperspectral Two-Photon Microscopy;Background: Living tissues contain a range of intrinsic fluorophores and sources of second harmonic generation which provide contrast that can be exploited for fresh tissue imaging. Microscopic imaging of fresh tissue samples can circumvent the cost and time associated with conventional histology. Further, intrinsic contrast can provide rich information about a tissue's composition, structure and function, and opens the potential for in-vivo imaging without the need for contrast agents. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we used hyperspectral two-photon microscopy to explore the characteristics of both normal and diseased gastrointestinal (GI) tissues, relying only on their endogenous fluorescence and second harmonic generation to provide contrast. We obtained hyperspectral data at subcellular resolution by acquiring images over a range of two-photon excitation wavelengths, and found excitation spectral signatures of specific tissue types based on our ability to clearly visualize morphology. We present the two-photon excitation spectral properties of four major tissue types that are present throughout the GI tract: epithelium, lamina propria, collagen, and lymphatic tissue. Using these four excitation signatures as basis spectra, linear unmixing strategies were applied to hyperspectral data sets of both normal and neoplastic tissue acquired in the colon and small intestine. Our results show that hyperspectral unmixing with excitation spectra allows segmentation, showing promise for blind identification of tissue types within a field of view, analogous to specific staining in conventional histology. The intrinsic spectral signatures of these tissue types provide information relating to their biochemical composition. Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest hyperspectral two-photon microscopy could provide an alternative to conventional histology either for in-situ imaging, or intraoperative 'instant histology' of fresh tissue biopsies.;2011;10.1371/journal.pone.0019925
C;In Vivo Imaging with Near-infrared Fluorescence Lifetime Contrast;Fluorescence imaging is a mainstay of biomedical research, allowing detection of molecular events in both fixed and living cells, tissues and whole animals. Such high resolution fluorescence imaging is hampered by unwanted signal from intrinsic background fluorescence and scattered light. The signal to background ratio can be improved by using extrinsic contrast agents and greatly enhanced by multispectral imaging methods. Unfortunately, these methods are insufficient for deep tissue imaging where high contrast and speedy acquisition are necessary. Fluorescence lifetime (FLT) is an inherent characteristic of each fluorescent species that can be independent of intensity and spectral properties. Accordingly, FLT-based detection provides an additional contrast mechanism to optical measurements. This contrast is particularly important in the near-infrared (NIR) due to relative transparency of tissue as well as the broad absorption and emission spectra of dyes that are active in this region. Here we report comparative analysis of signal distribution of several NIR fluorescent polymethine dyes in living mice and their correlations with lifetimes obtained in vitro using solution models. The FLT data obtained from dyes dissolved in serum albumin solution correlated well with FLTs measured in vivo. Thus the albumin solution model could be used as a good predictive model for in vivo FLT behavior of newly developed fluorescent reporters. Subsequent experiments in vivo, including monitoring slow release kinetics and detecting proteinuria, demonstrate the complementary nature of FLT for fluorescence intensity imaging.;2009;10.1117/12.809621
J;Biodistribution Survey of Oxidized Single-Wall Carbon Nanohorns Following Different Administration Routes by Using Label-Free Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography;Introduction: Though widely studied for biomedical applications, the lack of current systemic studies on the in vivo fate of single-walled carbon nanohorns (SWCNHs) largely restricts their further applications, as real-time monitoring of their biodistribution remains a big challenge. Here, we aim to customize a label-free multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) method and systematically survey the fate of oxidized SWCNHs (SWCNHox) following different exposure routes by whole body imaging. Methods: Mice were given a suspension of SWCNHox with an average size of 136.4 nm via four different administration routes, and then imaged by MSOT. Results: After oral gavage, SWCNHox were mainly distributed in the gastrointestinal tract then excreted through the gut. Compared with the observation post first dosing, the accumulation of SWCNHox in the gastrointestinal tract was not obvious even after four-time oral gavage. Almost no SWCNHox were found at detectable levels in kidney, liver, blood and spleen. Following intravenous (iv) injection, SWCNHox were mainly presented and persisted in the spleen and liver, while very little in the kidney and almost none detectable in the intestine. SWCNHox accumulated significantly in the liver and spleen after four IV administrations. Following hypodermic and intramuscular injections, almost no SWCNHox could cross biological barriers and transport to the spleen, kidney or liver, likely due to their very low absorption rate. Almost all SWCNHox remained around the injection sites. For the first time, we have systematically investigated the in vivo fate of SWCNHs in a label-free and real-time manner. Conclusion: The findings of this study provide insights into the selection of appropriate exposure routes for potential biomedical applications of carbon nanomaterials.;2019;10.2147/IJN.S215648
C;ADVANCING THE TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS OF SURGICAL FLUORESCENCE IMAGING WITH TARGETED FLUOROCHROMES;A new concept aiming to improve surgical outcome by providing real-time surgical feedback on tumor margin delineation is presented. We are using a novel multispectral imaging system for real time measurement of fluorescence probes with molecular specificity to tumor biomarkers. Mice bearing xenograft tumors were used to simulate surgical operations of tumor excision guided by real time fluorescence imaging. Bioluminescence imaging and histopathology were used as gold standards to confirm the in-vivo findings. Results demonstrate the capability of the method to identify tumor negative margins with high specificity and provide real time feedback to the surgeon.;2010;10.1109/ISBI.2010.5490160
C;Identifying constituent spectra sources in multispectral images to quantify and locate cervical neoplasia;Optical spectroscopy has been shown to be an effective method for detecting neoplasia. Guided Therapeutics has developed LightTouch, a non invasive device that uses a combination of reflectance and fluorescence spectroscopy for identifying early cancer of the human cervix. The combination of the multispectral information from the two spectroscopic modalities has been shown to be an effective method to screen for cervical cancer. There has however been a relative paucity of work in identifying the individual spectral components that contribute to the measured fluorescence and reflectance spectra. This work aims to identify the constituent source spectra and their concentrations. We used non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) numerical methods to decompose the mixed multispectral data into the constituent spectra and their corresponding concentrations. NNMF is an iterative approach that factorizes the measured data into non-negative factors. The factors are chosen to minimize the root-mean-squared residual error. NNMF has shown promise for feature extraction and identification in the fields of text mining and spectral data analysis. Since both the constituent source spectra and their corresponding concentrations are assumed to be non-negative by nature NNMF is a reasonable approach to deconvolve the measured multispectral data. Supervised learning methods were then used to determine which of the constituent spectra sources best predict the amount of neoplasia. The constituent spectra sources found to best predict neoplasia were then compared with spectra of known biological chromophores.;2011;10.1117/12.888811
J;Non-invasive in vivo tracking of fibrin degradation by fluorescence imaging;Fibrin-based sealants consist of natural coagulation factors involved in the final phase of blood coagulation, during which fibrinogen is enzymatically converted by thrombin to form a solid-phase fibrin clot. For applications in tissue regeneration, a controlled process of matrix degradation within a certain period of time is essential for optimal wound healing. Hence, it is desirable to follow the kinetics of fibrinolysis at the application site. Non-invasive molecular imaging systems enable real-time tracking of processes in the living animal. In this study, a non-invasive fluorescence based imaging system was applied to follow and quantify site-specific degradation of fibrin sealant. To enable non-invasive tracking of fibrin in vivo, fibrin-matrix was labelled by incorporation of a fluorophore-conjugated fibrinogen component. Protein degradation and release of fluorescence were, in a first step, correlated in vitro. In vivo, fluorophore-labelled fibrin was subcutaneously implanted in mice and followed throughout the experiment using a multispectral imaging system. For the fluorescent fibrin, degradation correlated with the release of fluorescence from the clots in vitro. In vivo it was possible to follow and quantify implanted fibrin clots throughout the experiment, demonstrating degradation kinetics of approximately 16days in the subcutaneous compartment, which was further confirmed by histological evaluation of the application site.

J;Dark-field hyperspectral microscopy for label-free microplastics and nanoplastics detection and identification in vivo: A Caenorhabditis elegans study;Microplastics pollution is a serious ecological threat, severely affecting environments and human health. Tackling microplastics pollution requires an effective methodology to detect minute polymer particles in environmental samples and organisms. Here were report a novel methodology to visualise and identify nanoscale (down to 100 nm) and microscale synthetic commercially-available uniform spherical polymer particles using dark-field hyperspectral microscopy in visible-near infrared (400-1000 nm) wavelength range. Polystyrene particles with diameters between 100 nm-1 mu m, polymethacrylate 1 mu m and melamine formaldehyde 2 mu m microspheres suspended in pure water samples were effectively imaged and chemically identified based on spectral signatures and image-assisted analysis. We succeeded in visualisation and spectral identification of pure and mixed nano- and microplastics in vivo employing optically-transparent Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes as a model to demonstrate the ingestion and tissue distribution of microplastics. As we demonstrate here, dark-field hyperspectral microscopy is capable for differentiating between chemically-different microplastics confined within live invertebrate intestines. Moreover, this optical technology allows for quantitative identification of microplastics ingested by nematodes. We believe that this label-free non-destructive methodology will find numerous applications in environmental nano- and microplastics detection and quantification, investigation of their biodistribution in tissues and organs and nanotoxicology.

J;Self-illuminating quantum dots for non-invasive bioluminescence imaging of mammalian gametes;Background: The fertility performance of animals is still a mystery and the full comprehension of mammalian gametes maturation and early embryonic development remains to be elucidated. The recent development in nanotechnology offers a new opportunity for real-time study of reproductive cells in their physiological environments. As a first step toward that goal, we evaluated the effectiveness of a fluorescent and luminescent nanoparticle for in vitro and ex vivo imaging of porcine gametes. Methods: Freshly harvested boar sperm were labeled with red-shifted (655 nm) quantum dot nanoparticles conjugated (QD+) or not (QD-) with plasminogen antibody and evaluated. Subsets of labeled spermatozoa were loaded into straws and placed within the lumen of gilt reproductive tracts for ex vivo intra-uterine imaging. Porcine cumuluso-ocyte complexes (COCs) were matured in the presence of QD- or QD+. Ovarian follicles were microinjected with QD- or QD+ and placed in culture for up to 4 days. After labeling, all samples were supplemented with coelenterazine, the luciferase substrate, and immediately submitted to bioluminescence analysis, followed by fluorescence and hyperspectral imaging. Data were analyzed with ANOVA and P < 0.05 indicated significant differences. Results: All labeled-samples revealed bioluminescence emission that was confirmed by fluorescence and hyperspectral imaging of the QD localization within the cells and tissues. Over 76% of spermatozoa and both immature and mature COCs were successfully labeled with QD- or QD+. The QD- fluorescence appeared homogenously distributed in the oocytes, while found in the entire sperm length with a higher accumulation within the mid-piece. Labeled-follicles exhibited a progressive migration of QD nanoparticles within the follicle wall during culture. In contrast, QD+ fluorescence signals appeared condensed and stronger in the follicle cells, sperm head, and sub-plasma membrane area of mature oocytes. Weaker QD+ signals were detected in the cumulus cells. Fluorescence and hyperspectral microscope imaging showed comparable intracellular QD localization. Ex-vivo intra-uterine bioluminescence imaging of labeled spermatozoa revealed stronger signals captured over the oviducts, with uterine body allowing the lowest signal detection. Conclusion: Findings indicate that conjugated and non-conjugated fluorescent nanoparticles can be used for effective labeling of mammalian gametes for in vitro monitoring and potential in vivo targeted-imaging.;2015;10.1186/s12951-015-0097-1
J;Hyperspectral Modeling of Skin Appearance;Exploration of the hyperspectral domain offers a host of new research and application possibilities involving material appearance modeling. In this article, we address these prospects with respect to human skin, one of the most ubiquitous materials portrayed in synthetic imaging. We present the first hyperspectral model designed for the predictive rendering of skin appearance attributes in the ultraviolet, visible, and infrared domains. The proposed model incorporates the intrinsic bio-optical properties of human skin affecting light transport in these spectral regions, including the particle nature and distribution patterns of the main light attenuation agents found within the cutaneous tissues. Accordingly, it accounts for phenomena that significantly affect skin spectral signatures, both within and outside the visible domain, such as detour and sieve effects, that are overlooked by existing skin appearance models. Using a first-principles approach, the proposed model computes the surface and subsurface scattering components of skin reflectance taking into account not only the wavelength and the illumination geometry, but also the positional dependence of the reflected light. Hence, the spectral and spatial distributions of light interacting with human skin can be comprehensively represented in terms of hyperspectral reflectance and BSSRDF, respectively.;2015;10.1145/2701416
C;Multi-color backscattering Mueller matrix imaging on thick fresh tissues and on living nude mice skin;It has been demonstrated in many biomedical applications that polarization imaging is capable of probing the characteristic microstructural features of complex biological specimens quantitatively and non-invasively. In a recent study, we carried on backscattering Muller matrix imaging on living nude mice skin using oblique illumination by a 633nm LED light source. We quantitatively measured how the anisotropy properties of the living mice skin changes as functions of the UV exposure time. The time course features provide vital clue for the mechanism of UV damage and the effectiveness of sunscreen for reducing such damage. In this work, we report an upgraded system with LED light sources of five different colors ranging from blue to red. The system is calibrated by taking multi-color Mueller matrix images using a single set of rotating achromatic quarter-wave plates. In both in situ applications on living nude mice skin and ex vivo imaging of thick fresh tissue samples, we demonstrated that the multi-color polarized light backscattering measurements are able to reveal more details on the microstructure of the sample, particularly helpful in separating different effects due to photon scattering and propagation.;2018;10.1117/12.2289611
J;Nanoaggregate Probe for Breast Cancer Metastasis through Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography and Aggregation-Induced NIR-I/II Fluorescence Imaging;An activatable nanoprobe for imaging breast cancer metastases through near infrared-I (NIR-I)/NIR-II fluorescence imaging and multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging was designed. With a dihydroxanthene moiety serving as the electron donor, quinolinium as the electron acceptor and nitrobenzyloxydiphenylamino as the recognition element, the probe can specifically respond to nitroreductase and transform into an activated D-pi-A structure with a NIR emission band extending beyond 900 nm. The activated nanoprobe exhibits NIR emission enhanced by aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and produces strong optoacoustic signal. The nanoprobe was used to detect and image metastases from the orthotopic breast tumors to lymph nodes and then to lung in two breast cancer mouse models. Moreover, the nanoprobe can monitor the treatment efficacy during chemotherapeutic course through fluorescence and MSOT imaging.;2020;10.1002/anie.201913149
C;Non-invasive detection of matrix-metalloproteinase activity in a mouse model of cerebral ischemia using multispectral-optoacoustic-tomography;Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play important roles in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia. Here we visualized in vivo MMP activity in the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) mouse model using multispectral optoacoustic imaging (MSOT) with a MMP-activatable probe. MSOT data was co-registered with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) obtained at 7 T for localization of signal distribution. We demonstrated upregulated MMP signal within the focal ischemic lesion in the tMCAO mouse model using MSOT/MRI multimodal imaging. This convenient non-invasive method will allow repetitive measurement following the time course of MMP-lesion development in ischemic stroke animal model.;2018;10.1117/12.2286313
J;Automated segmentation of pigmented skin lesions in multispectral imaging;The aim of this study was to develop an algorithm for the automatic segmentation of multispectral images of pigmented skin lesions. The study involved 1700 patients with 1856 cutaneous pigmented lesions, which were analysed in vivo by a novel spectrophotometric system, before excision. The system is able to acquire a set of 15 different multispectral images at equally spaced wavelengths between 483 and 951 run. An original segmentation algorithm was developed and applied to the whole set of lesions and was able to automatically contour them all. The obtained lesion boundaries were shown to two expert clinicians, who, independently, rejected 54 of them. The 97.1% contour accuracy indicates that the developed algorithm could be a helpful and effective instrument for the automatic segmentation of skin pigmented lesions.;2005;10.1088/0031-9155/50/22/N01
J;A novel approach for Jatropha curcas seed health analysis based on multispectral and resonance imaging techniques;Innovative methods have been developed in the state-of-the-art technologies based on robust spectral-spatial sensors for modern seed industry. In this study we proposed a novel approach based on multispectral imaging combined with machine learning algorithm to classify Jatropha curcas seed health. Furthermore, we present for the first time a methodology based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify anatomical changes in J. curcas seeds infected with different pathogenic fungi. First, seeds were artificially inoculated with Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Colletotrichum siamense and Colletotrichum truncatum, and multispectral images were acquired after 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 h of incubation. The MRI method was applied using incubated seeds for 168 h. Our results showed that the multispectral imaging technique combined with statistical models has the potential to distinguish different fungal species in J. curcas seeds after 48 h of incubation, with high accuracy (>80 %). The proposed MRI methodology allowed the identification of different damage patterns in the endosperm tissues infected with L. theobromae, C. siamense and C. truncatum. Therefore, multispectral imaging and MRI can be useful tools for rapid and accurate detection of different fungal species in J. curcas seeds.;2021;10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.113186
J;Nonlinear laser imaging of skin lesions;We investigated different kinds of human ex-vivo skin samples by combined two-photon intrinsic fluorescence (TPE), second-harmonic generation microscopy (SHG), fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and multispectral two-photon emission detection (MTPE). Morphological and spectroscopic differences were found between healthy and pathological skin samples, including tumors. In particular, we examined tissue samples from normal and pathological scar tissue (keloid), and skin tumors, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and malignant melanoma (MM). By using combined TPE-SHG microscopy we investigated morphological features of different skin regions. Further comparative analysis of healthy skin and neoplastic samples was performed using FLIM, and MTPE. Finally, we demonstrated the use of methyl-aminolevulinate as a contrast agent to increase the contrast in BCC border detection. The results obtained represent further support for in-vivo noninvasive imaging of diseased skin.

J;Cosine histogram analysis for spectral image data classification;Conventional multivariate strategies for making qualitative estimates of sample composition rely chiefly on identifying subtle differences in spectral shape. In some instances, such as in biological tissues, the spectra obtained from a single sample class may consist of many shapes. Likewise, two distinctly different sample classes, such as normal and abnormal tissue, may produce similar variations in spectral shape. In our work, we employ statistical analysis of the set of cosine correlation scores obtained from multispectral visible absorption images of stained cervical Papanicolaou samples. By analyzing the cosine correlation score frequency for spectra obtained from the cell nuclei, abnormal cells can be differentiated from the background of normal cells, which vary considerably in their optical properties and morphology. Our method, called cosine histogram analysis (CHA), returns the percent likelihood of abnormality for each pixel in the field of view and is presented here for the first time.;2004;10.1366/0003702042475547
J;Multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging system for intravascular diagnostics with ultrasound guidance: in vivo validation in swine arteries;Fluorescence lifetime technique has demonstrated potential for analysis of atherosclerotic lesions and for complementing existing intravascular imaging modalities such as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in identifying lesions at high risk of rupture. This study presents a multimodal catheter system integrating a 40 MHz commercial IVUS and fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) using fast helical motion scanning (400 rpm, 0.75 mm/s), able to acquire in vivo in pulsatile blood flow the autofluorescence emission of arterial vessels with high precision (5.08 +/- 0.26 ns mean average lifetime over 13 scans). Co-registered FLIm and IVUS data allowed 3D visualization of both biochemical and morphological vessel properties. Current study supports the development of clinically compatible intravascular diagnostic system integrating FLIm and demonstrates, to our knowledge, the first in vivo intravascular application of a fluorescence lifetime imaging technique.

C;Simultaneous visualization of nerves and blood vessels with multispectral photoacoustic imaging for intraoperative guidance of neurosurgeries.;Real-time intraoperative guidance during neurosurgeries are often limited to endoscopy or microscopy, which are suboptimal when locating underlying blood vessels and nerves. However, accidental damage to these hidden yet critical structures can have severe surgical complications. To overcome this challenge, we are developing a fast-tuning, multispectral photoacoustic approach to guiding neurological procedures. An ex vivo porcine sciatic nerve and ex vivo caprine carotid artery perfused with whole human blood were suspended in a water bath. A spectroscopic analysis with wavelengths 690 nm to 1260 nm was performed on each specimen with a constant optical energy of 1.5 mJ/pulse and 11 mJ/pulse utilizing a 1 mm diameter optical fiber and a 5 mm diameter fiber bundle, respectively. The contrast and signal-to-noise ratio of each target was calculated from photoacoustic images, with wavelength-dependent contrast values and signal-to-noise ratios that ranged from 0.41 to 21.8 dB and 10.12 to 25.6 dB, respectively. In particular, the blood vessel contrast (18.2 dB) was greater than the nerve contrast (0.61 dB) when excited with 750 nm light. However, the nerve contrast (10.7 dB) was greater than the blood vessel contrast (6.6 dB) when excited with 1230 nm light. These results indicate that simultaneous visualization of major vessels and nerves requires an imaging system that exploits the unique optical absorption peaks of both hemoglobin and lipids by fast-tuning between two excitation wavelengths (e.g., 750 and 1230 nm).;2019;10.1117/12.2508167
C;Minimally invasive optical biopsy for oximetry;The study of localised oxygen saturation in blood vessels can shed light on the etiology and progression of many diseases with which hypoxia is associated. For example, hypoxia in the tendon has been linked to early stages of rheumatoid arthritis, an auto-immune inflammatory disease. Vascular oximetry of deep tissue presents significant challenges as vessels are not optically accessible. In this paper, we present a novel multispectral imaging technique for vascular oximetry, and recent developments made towards its adaptation for minimally invasive imaging. We present proof-of-concept of the system and illumination scheme as well as the analysis technique. We present results of a validation study performed in vivo on mice with acutely inflamed tendons. Adaptation of the technique for minimally invasive microendoscopy is also presented, along with preliminary results of minimally invasive ex vivo vascular oximetry.;2017;10.1117/12.2253645
C;Modeling the variation in speed of sound between couplant and tissue improves the spectral accuracy of multispectral optoacoustic tomography;Even though the speed of sound (SoS) is non-homogeneous in biological tissue, most reconstruction algorithms for optoacoustic imaging neglect its variation. In addition, when heavy water is used as coupling medium to enable imaging of certain biological chromophores such as lipids and proteins, the SoS also differs significantly between couplant and tissue. While the assumption of uniform SoS is known to introduce visible deformations of features in single-wavelength optoacoustic images, the spectral error introduced by the assumption of uniform SoS is not fully understood. In this work, we provide an in-depth spectral analysis of multi-spectral optoacoustic imaging artifacts that result from the assumption of uniform SoS in situations where SoS changes substantially. We propose a dual-SoS model to incorporate the SoS variation between the couplant and the sample. Tissue-mimicking phantom experiments and in vivo measurements show that uniform SoS reconstruction causes spectral smearing, which dual-SoS modeling can largely eliminate. Due to this increased spectral accuracy, the method has the potential to improve clinical studies that rely on quantitative optoacoustic imaging of biomolecules like hemoglobin or lipids.;2019;10.1117/12.2506425
J;A Review on Advances in Intra-operative Imaging for Surgery and Therapy: Imagining the Operating Room of the Future;With the advent of Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS), intra-operative imaging has become crucial for surgery and therapy guidance, allowing to partially compensate for the lack of information typical of MIS. This paper reviews the advancements in both classical (i.e. ultrasounds, X-ray, optical coherence tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) and more recent (i.e. multispectral, photoacoustic and Raman imaging) intra-operative imaging modalities. Each imaging modality was analyzed, focusing on benefits and disadvantages in terms of compatibility with the operating room, costs, acquisition time and image characteristics. Tables are included to summarize this information. New generation of hybrid surgical room and algorithms for real time/in room image processing were also investigated. Each imaging modality has its own (site- and procedure-specific) peculiarities in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, field of view and contrasted tissues. Besides the benefits that each technique offers for guidance, considerations about operators and patient risk, costs, and extra time required for surgical procedures have to be considered. The current trend is to equip surgical rooms with multimodal imaging systems, so as to integrate multiple information for real-time data extraction and computer-assisted processing. The future of surgery is to enhance surgeons eye to minimize intra- and after-surgery adverse events and provide surgeons with all possible support to objectify and optimize the care-delivery process.;2020;10.1007/s10439-020-02553-6
C;Two-photon imaging and spectroscopy of fresh human colon biopsies;Two-photon fluorescence (TPEF) microscopy is a powerful tool to image human tissues up to 200 microns depth without any exogenously added probe. TPEF can take advantage of the autofluorescence of molecules intrinsically contained in a biological tissue, as such NADH, elastin, collagen, and flavins. Two-photon microscopy has been already successfully used to image several types of tissues, including skin, muscles, tendons, bladder. Nevertheless, its usefulness in imaging colon tissue has not been deeply investigated yet. In this work we have used combined two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF), second harmonic generation microscopy (SHG), fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and multispectral two-photon emission detection (MTPE) to investigate different kinds of human ex-vivo fresh biopsies of colon. Morphological and spectroscopic analyses allowed to characterize both healthy mucosa, polyp, and colon samples in a good agreement with common routine histology. Even if further analysis, as well as a more significant statistics on a large number of samples would be helpful to discriminate between low, mild, and high grade cancer, our method is a promising tool to be used as diagnostic confirmation of histological results, as well as a diagnostic tool in a multiphoton endoscope or colonoscope to be used in in-vivo imaging applications.;2012;10.1117/12.907822
J;Multispectral hybrid Cerenkov luminescence tomography based on the finite element SPn method;Cerenkov luminescence tomography (CLT) is a promising tool that enables three-dimensional non-invasive in vivo detection of radiopharmaceuticals. Conventionally, multispectral information and diffusion theory were introduced to achieve whole-body tomographic reconstruction. However, the diffusion theory inevitably causes systematic error in blue bands of the electromagnetic spectrum due to high-tissue absorption, and CL has a blue-weighted broad spectrum. Therefore, it is challenging to improve the accuracy of CLT. The performance of the n-order simplified spherical harmonics approximation (SPn) in different spectra is evaluated, and a multispectral hybrid CLT based on the combination of different SPn models is proposed to handle the Cerenkov photon transport problem in complex media. The in vivo xenograft experiment shows that this approach can effectively improve the quality and accuracy of the reconstructed light source. We believe that the new reconstruction method will advance the development of CLT for more in vivo imaging applications.

J;Magnetic resonance microdynamic imaging reveals distinct tissue microenvironments;"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a powerful set of tools with which to investigate biological tissues noninvasively and in vivo. Tissues are heterogeneous in nature; an imaging voxel contains an ensemble of different cells and extracellular matrix components. A long-standing challenge has been to infer the content of and interactions among these microscopic tissue components within a macroscopic imaging voxel. Spatially resolved multidimensional relaxation-diffusion correlation (REDCO) spectroscopy holds the potential to deliver such microdynamic information. However, to date, vast data requirements have mostly relegated these type of measurements to nuclear magnetic resonance applications and prevented them from being widely and successfully used in conjunction with imaging. By using a novel data acquisition and processing strategy in this study, spatially resolved REDCO could be performed in reasonable scanning times with excellent prospects for clinical applications. This new MR imaging framework-which we term magnetic resonance microdynamic imaging (MRMI)-permits the simultaneous noninvasive and model-free quantification of multiple subcellular, cellular, and interstitial tissue microenvironments within a voxel. MRMI is demonstrated with a fixed spinal cord specimen, enabling the quantification of microscopic tissue components with unprecedented specificity. Tissue components, such as axons, neuronal and glial soma, and myelin were identified on the basis of their multispectral signature within individual imaging voxels. These tissue elements could then be composed into images and be correlated with immunohistochemistry findings. MRMI provides novel image contrasts of tissue components and a new family of microdynamic biomarkers that could lead to new diagnostic imaging approaches to probe biological tissue alterations accompanied by pathological or developmental changes.";2017;10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.09.033
J;Latanoprost Stimulates Ocular Lymphatic Drainage: An In Vivo Nanotracer Study;Purpose: Ocular lymphatics have been recently shown to contribute to aqueous humor outflow. It is not yet known whether lymphatic outflow can be stimulated by pharmacological agents. Here we determine whether latanoprost, a prostaglandin F2 alpha analog commonly used to lower IOP to treat glaucoma, increases lymphatic drainage from the eye. Methods: Lymphatic drainage in mice was assessed in vivo, in 11 latanoprost-treated and 11 control animals using hyperspectral imaging at multiple times following quantum dot (QD) injection into the eye. QD signal intensity was also measured in tissue sections using hyperspectral imaging. Results: In the latanoprost-treated group, lymphatic drainage rate into the submandibular lymph node was increased compared with controls (1.23 +/- 1.06 hours(-1) vs. 0.30 +/- 0.17 hours(-1), mean +/- SD, P < 0.02). Total QD signal intensity in the submandibular lymph node was greater in the latanoprost-treated group compared with controls (10.55 +/- 1.12 vs. 9.48 +/- 1.24, log scale, P < 0.05). Conclusions: This is the first evidence that latanoprost increases lymphatic drainage from the eye. The pharmacological manipulation of this newly identified lymphatic outflow pathway may be relevant to treatments aimed at lowering intraocular pressure in glaucoma.;2013;10.1167/tvst.2.5.3
J;Seeing the Invisible: Revealing Atrial Ablation Lesions Using Hyperspectral Imaging Approach;Background Currently, there are limited means for high-resolution monitoring of tissue injury during radio-frequency ablation procedures. Objective To develop the next generation of visualization catheters that can reveal irreversible atrial muscle damage caused by ablation and identify viability gaps between the lesions. Methods Radiofrequency lesions were placed on the endocardial surfaces of excised human and bovine atria and left ventricles of blood perfused rat hearts. Tissue was illuminated with 365nm light and a series of images were acquired from individual spectral bands within 420-720nm range. By extracting spectral profiles of individual pixels and spectral unmixing, the relative contribution of ablated and unablated spectra to each pixel was then displayed. Results of spectral unmixing were compared to lesion pathology. Results RF ablation caused significant changes in the tissue autofluorescence profile. The magnitude of these spectral changes in human left atrium was relatively small (<10% of peak fluorescence value), yet highly significant. Spectral unmixing of hyperspectral datasets enabled high spatial resolution, in-situ delineation of radiofrequency lesion boundaries without the need for exogenous markers. Lesion dimensions derived from hyperspectral imaging approach strongly correlated with histological outcomes. Presence of blood within the myocardium decreased the amplitude of the autofluorescence spectra while having minimal effect on their overall shapes. As a result, the ability of hyperspectral imaging to delineate ablation lesions in vivo was not affected. Conclusions Hyperspectral imaging greatly increases the contrast between ablated and unablated tissue enabling visualization of viability gaps at clinically relevant locations. Data supports the possibility for developing percutaneous hyperspectral catheters for high-resolution ablation guidance.;2016;10.1371/journal.pone.0167760
J;Effect of tissue optics on wavelength optimization for quantum dot-based surface and subsurface fluorescence imaging;Optimization is an important but relatively unexplored aspect of contrast-enhanced fluorescence imaging, since minimizing contrast agent usage reduces the associated cost and potential toxicity. In a previous study, the authors developed a quantitative experimental approach to optimize quantum dot (QD)-based imaging using homogenized liver as a model tissue. In this follow-up study, the authors further extend and validate the approach using eight different tissues and five QDs emission wavelengths, and introduce quantitative imaging performance metrics, namely the threshold QD concentration and wavelength optimization gain. These metrics allow quantification of the improvements through spectral optimization in terms of reduced QD dose and identify the conditions that make the optimization process worthwhile. The authors show that, for most tissues, the most important parameter to optimize is the emission wavelength, yielding improvements of up to four orders of magnitude, followed by the excitation wavelength (up to 20-fold improvement) and the excitation filter bandwidth (up to 50% improvement). The authors also observe, by means of the optimization gain metric, that tissues exhibiting both high autofluorescence and strong pigmentation are generally better candidates for excitation wavelength optimization. This work contributes to the development of robust and quantitative dosimetry for QD-based fluorescence imaging near to the tissue surface.

J;Dual-Modality Surface-Enhanced Resonance Raman Scattering and Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography Nanoparticle Approach for Brain Tumor Delineation;Difficulty in visualizing glioma margins intraoperatively remains a major issue in the achievement of gross total tumor resection and, thus, better dinical outcome of glioblastoma (GBM) patients. Here, the potential of a new combined optical + optoacoustic imaging method for intraoperative brain tumor delineation is investigated. A strategy using a newly developed gold nanostar synthesis method, Raman reporter chemistry, and silication method to produce dual-modality contrast agents for combined surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) and multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging is devised. Following intravenous injection of the SERRS-MSOT-nanostars in brain tumor bearing mice, sequential MSOT imaging is performed in vivo and followed by Raman imaging. MSOT is able to accurately depict GBMs three-dimensionally with high specificity. The MSOT signal is found to correlate well with the SERRS images. Because SERRS enables uniquely sensitive high-resolution surface detection, it could represent an ideal complementary imaging modality to MSOT, which enables real-time, deep tissue imaging in 3D. This dual-modality SERRS-MSOT-nanostar contrast agent reported here is shown to enable high precision depiction of the extent of infiltrating GBMs by Raman- and MSOT imaging in a clinically relevant murine GBM model and could pave new ways for improved image-guided resection of brain tumors.;2018;10.1002/smll.201800740
J;Deep imaging of absorption and scattering features by multispectral multiple scattering low coherence interferometry;We have developed frequency domain multispectral multiple scattering low coherence interferometry (ms2/LCI) for deep imaging of absorption and scattering contrast. Using tissue-mimicking phantoms that match the full scattering phase function of human dermal tissue, we demonstrate that ms2/LCI can provide a signal/noise ratio (SNR) improvement of 15.4 dB over conventional OCT at an imaging depth of 1 mm. The enhanced SNR and penetration depth provided by ms2/LCI could be leveraged for a variety of clinical applications including the assessment of burn injuries where current clinical classification of severity only provides limited accuracy. The utility of the approach was demonstrated by imaging a tissue phantom simulating a partial-thickness burn revealing good spectroscopic contrast between healthy and injured tissue regions deep below the sample surface. Finally, healthy rat skin was imaged in vivo with both a commercial OCT instrument and our custom ms2/LCI system. The results demonstrate that ms2/LCI is capable of obtaining spectroscopic information far beyond the penetration depth provided by conventional OCT.

J;In-vivo imaging of psoriatic lesions with polarization multispectral dermoscopy and multiphoton microscopy;Psoriasis is a skin autoimmune disease characterized by hyperkeratosis, hyperproliferation of the epidermis and dilatation of dermal papillary blood vessels. Healthy skin (5 volunteers) and psoriatic lesions (3 patients) were visualized in vivo, with high contrast and resolution, with a Polarization Multispectral Dermoscope and a Multiphoton Microscope. Psoriatic features were identified and quantified. The effective diameter of the superficial blood vessels was measured at 35.2 +/- 7.2 mu m and the elongated dermal papillae had an effective diameter of 64.2 +/- 22.6 mu m. The methodologies developed could be employed for quantitative diagnostic purposes and furthermore serve as a monitoring method of the effect of personalized treatments.

J;Development of an advanced hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system with applications for cancer detection;An advanced hyper-spectral imaging (HSI) system has been developed having obvious applications for cancer detection. This HSI system is based on state-of-the-art liquid crystal tunable filter technology coupled to an endoscope. The goal of this unique HSI technology being developed is to obtain spatially resolved images of the slight differences in luminescent properties of malignant versus non-malignant tissues. In this report, the development of the instrument is discussed and the capability of the instrument is demonstrated by observing mouse carcinomas in-vivo. It is shown that the instrument successfully distinguishes between normal and malignant mouse skin. It is hoped that the results of this study will lead to advances in the optical diagnosis of cancer in humans.;2006;10.1007/s10439-006-9121-9
J;Mapping In Vivo Tumor Oxygenation within Viable Tumor by F-19-MRI and Multispectral Analysis;Quantifying oxygenation in viable tumor remains a major obstacle toward a better understanding of the tumor micro-environment and improving treatment strategies. Current techniques are often complicated by tumor heterogeneity. Herein, a novel in vivo approach that combines F-19 magnetic resonance imaging (F-19-MRI) R-1 mapping with diffusionbased multispectral (MS) analysis is introduced. This approach restricts the partial pressure of oxygen (pO(2)) measurements to viable tumor, the tissue of therapeutic interest. The technique exhibited sufficient sensitivity to detect a breathing gas challenge in a xenograft tumor model, and the hypoxic region measured by MS F-19-MRI was strongly correlated with histologic estimates of hypoxia. This approach was then applied to address the effects of antivascular agents on tumor oxygenation, which is a research question that is still under debate. The technique was used to monitor longitudinal pO(2) changes in response to an antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (B20.4.1.1) and a selective dual phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (GDC-0980). GDC-0980 reduced viable tumor pO(2) during a 3-day treatment period, and a significant reduction was also produced by B20.4.1.1. Overall, this method provides an unprecedented view of viable tumor pO(2) and contributes to a greater understanding of the effects of antivascular therapies on the tumor's microenvironment.;2013;10.1593/neo.131468
J;Real-Time Imaging Tracking of a Dual Fluorescent Drug Delivery System Based on Zinc Phthalocyanine-Incorporated Hydrogel;Real-time tracking of a drug delivery system and its therapeutic effects in vivo are crucial to designing a novel pharmaceutical system and revealing the mechanism of drug therapy. Multispectral fluorescence imaging can locate the drug and carrier simultaneously without interference. This advanced method enables the tracking of a drug delivery system. Herein, a doxorubicin (Dox) loaded zinc phthalocyanine incorporated hydrogel was developed as a dual fluorescent drug delivery system to monitor the release of the drug and the degradation of the carrier. An injectable thermosensitive hydrogel based on a four-arm poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) poly(e-Caprolactone) (PCL) copolymer was prepared and characterized with a zinc phthalocyanine core as the drug carrier. The hydrogel degradation and drug delivery in vivo were tracked by a multispectral fluorescence imaging system in nude mice bearing hepatic tumors. Moreover, the real-time tumor inhibition progress was tracked in vivo for 18 days by bioluminescence imaging. A multispectral analysis can separate the fluorescence signals from the drug and carrier in the Dox loaded hydrogel and provide their location in the tumor tissue. The drug release and hydrogel degradation can be drastically tracked respectively without mutual interference. The fluorescence imaging results reveal improved tumor inhibitory effects of the Dox loaded hydrogel. Optical imaging allows for visible tracking of the entire drug delivery process. The Dox loaded phthalocyanine incorporated thermosensitive hydrogel is a potential visible drug delivery system for tumor therapy.;2016;10.1021/acsbiomaterials.6b00403
J;An optimal finite element error estimate for an inverse problem in multispectral bioluminescence tomography;Inspired by the paper (Gong, W., Li, R., Yan, N. N. & Zhao, W. B. (2008) An improved error analysis for finite element approximation of bioluminescence tomography. J. Comput. Math., 26, 1-13), we consider an optimal finite element error estimate for an inverse problem in multispectral bioluminescence tomography. Different from achromatic or monochromatic measurements, hyperspectral or multispectral data can reduce the ill-posedness of the inverse problem and yield improved depth reconstruction. Compared with Gong et al. (2008, An improved error analysis for finite element approximation of bioluminescence tomography. J. Comput. Math., 26, 1-13), which just improved the error order of piecewise constant light source function, error order in this paper is optimal and all error estimates here are valid for a general smooth domain rather than a polyhedral/polygonal one. Moreover, under a boundedness assumption for the admissible source set, the constants in our error estimates do not depend on the regularization parameter, and therefore are bounded.;2015;10.1093/imamat/hxt031
J;TISSUE OXYGEN LEVEL IN ACUTE AND CHRONIC WOUND: A COMPARISON STUDY;Adequate oxygen supply to granulating tissue and its surroundings is considered as an elementary factor to render an optimum condition for proper wound healing. This paper focused on comparing the quantitative mean of transcutaneous oxygen saturation (StO(2)) between acute superficial wounds and chronic diabetic wounds in a randomized clinical study. A multispectral imaging system was employed for in-vivo measurement of wound StO(2) across a visible wavelength range of 530. 570 nm. Processed StO(2) maps of wounds using a reconstructed mathematical model revealed a mean StO(2) of 71.38. 7.07 % and 56.48. 6.27 %, respectively, in acute and chronic wounds. The statistical test on the difference in the values between these two groups of wounds was shown to be statistically significant (rho <= 0.05). These crucial findings contribute to the existing knowledge on the StO(2) range and its variation in different wound conditions. In conclusion, the proposed multispectral imaging system is able to produce clinical information of wound oxygenation level for a better understanding of the obligatory role of oxygen as a key determinant in healing outcomes.;2020;10.11113/jt.v82.14418
J;Intravital Molecular Imaging of Small-Diameter Tissue-Engineered Vascular Grafts in Mice: A Feasibility Study;"Objectives: Creating functional small-diameter tissue-engineered blood vessels has not been successful to date. Moreover, the processes underlying the in vivo remodeling of these grafts and the fate of cells seeded onto scaffolds remain unclear. Here we addressed these unmet scientific needs by using intravital molecular imaging to monitor the development of tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVG) implanted in mouse carotid artery. Methods and Results: Green fluorescent protein-labeled human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and cord blood-derived endothelial progenitor cells were seeded on polyglycolic acid-poly-L-lactic acid scaffolds to construct small-caliber TEVG that were subsequently implanted in the carotid artery position of nude mice (n = 9). Mice were injected with near-infrared agents and imaged using intravital fluorescence microscope at 0, 7, and 35 days to validate in vivo the TEVG remodeling capability (Prosense680; VisEn, Woburn, MA) and patency (Angiosense750; VisEn). Imaging coregistered strong proteolytic activity and blood flow through anastomoses at both 7 and 35 days postimplantation. In addition, image analyses showed green fluorescent protein signal produced from mesenchymal stem cell up to 35 days postimplantation. Comprehensive correlative histopathological analyses corroborated intravital imaging findings. Conclusions: Multispectral imaging offers simultaneous characterization of in vivo remodeling enzyme activity, functionality, and cell fate of viable small-caliber TEVG.";2010;10.1089/ten.tec.2009.0466
C;Using multispectral photoacoustic tomography for imaging scleroderma in the hand;Scleroderma (SD) is a rare autoimmune disease, which is divided into two categories: the localized SD and systemic SD. The localized SD mainly causes skin thickening of the fingers, whereas the systemic SD can further affect the blood vessels and internal organs. In this pilot study, the multispectral photoacoustic elastic tomography (PAET) imaging technique was used to recover quantitative physiological and elastic parameters of biological tissues for the diagnosis of SD. Three healthy subjects and three scleroderma patients were recruited and clinically examined by a rheumatologist, and then their hand /fingers were scanned by the both the commercial MRI and our home-made photoacoustic imaging system. Physiological parameters including oxygen saturation (STO2), deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb) and oxy-hemoglobin (HbO(2)) concentrations and mechanical properties such as bulk modulus images were reconstructed by using the developed PAET reconstruction method. Our imaging results demonstrated that the physiological and elastic parameters exhibit striking differences between the SD and healthy fingers, indicating that these indicators can serve as molecular signatures for the early detection of SD. These quantitative physiological properties and bulk modulus may also pave a new path for improved understanding the pathological mechanism of SD.;2019;10.1117/12.2508314
J;First Clinical Investigation of Near-Infrared Window IIa/IIb Fluorescence Imaging for Precise Surgical Resection of Gliomas;Objective: The near-infrared window II (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) imaging, including NIR-IIa (1300-1400 mm) and NIR-IIb (1500-1700 mm), outperforms the near-infrared window I (NIR-I, 700-900 nm) imaging in biological researches. However, the advantages of NIR-IIa/IIb imaging in human study are ambiguous. This study aims to apply the NIR-IIa/IIb imaging to glioma resection and evaluate their performance by using the developed imaging instrument and intraoperative image fusion method. Methods: A multispectral fluorescence imaging instrument that integrated NIR-I/II/IIa/IIb fluorescence imaging and an intraoperative image fusion method have been developed. Seven patients with grade III/IV glioma have been enrolled. NIR-I/II images of the tumor and NIR-I/II/IIa/IIb images of cerebral vessels were acquired with the administration of indocyanine green. Images were fused using the specialized fusion method to synchronously provide the distribution of the vessels and the surgical boundaries. Results: The NIR-IIa/IIb imaging was successfully applied to the clinic. High imaging resolution and contrast have been attained in the NIR-IIa/IIb spectra. Besides, capillaries with an apparent diameter as small as 182 mu m were acquired using NIR-IIb imaging. Tumor-feeding arteries were precisely blocked and tumors were excised to the maximum extent for all patients. The blood loss volume during surgery was significantly reduced compared with the control group. Conclusion: The multispectral fluorescence imaging showed high performance, which led to a significant reduction in blood loss volume. Significance: The novel multispectral fluorescence imaging technology can assist surgeons in other vascular surgeries in the future.;2022;10.1109/TBME.2022.3143859
J;Adding fifth dimension to optoacoustic imaging: volumetric time-resolved spectrally enriched tomography;Optoacoustics provides a unique set of capabilities for bioimaging, associated with the intrinsic combination of ultrasound-and light-related advantages, such as high spatial and temporal resolution as well as powerful spectrally enriched imaging contrast in biological tissues. We demonstrate here, for the first time, the acquisition, processing and visualization of five-dimensional optoacoustic data, thus offering unparallel imaging capacities among the current bioimaging modalities. The newly discovered performance is enabled by simultaneous volumetric detection and processing of multispectral data and is further showcased here by attaining time-resolved volumetric blood oxygenation maps in deep human vessels and real-time tracking of contrast agent distribution in a murine model in vivo.;2014;10.1038/lsa.2014.18
J;Strategies for Image-Guided Therapy, Surgery, and Drug Delivery Using Photoacoustic Imaging;Photoacoustic imaging is a rapidly maturing imaging modality in biological research and medicine. This modality uses the photoacoustic effect (light in, sound out) to combine the contrast and specificity of optical imaging with the high temporal resolution of ultrasound. The primary goal of image-guided therapy, and theranostics in general, is to transition from conventional medicine to precision strategies that combine diagnosis with therapy. Photoacoustic imaging is well-suited for noninvasive guidance of many therapies and applications currently being pursued in three broad areas. These include the image-guided resection of diseased tissue, monitoring of disease states, and drug delivery. In this review, we examine the progress and strategies for development of photoacoustics in these three key areas with an emphasis on the value photoacoustics has for image-guided therapy.;2019;10.7150/thno.32362
J;Dark-field/hyperspectral microscopy for detecting nanoscale particles in environmental nanotoxicology research;Nanoscale contaminants (induding engineered nanoparticles and nanoplastics) pose a significant threat to organisms and environment. Rapid and non-destructive detection and identification of nanosized materials in cells, tissues and organisms is still challenging, although a number of conventional methods exist. These approaches for nanoparticles imaging and characterisation both inside the cytoplasm and on the cell or tissue outer surfaces, such as electron or scanning probe microscopies, are unquestionably potent tools, having excellent resolution and supplemented with chemical analysis capabilities. However, imaging and detection of nanomaterials in situ, in wet unfixed and even live samples, such as living isolated cells, microorganisms, protozoans and miniature invertebrates using electron microscopy is practically impossible, because of the elaborate sample preparation requiring chemical fixation, contrast staining, matrix embedding and exposure into vacuum. Atomic force microscopy, in several cases, can be used for imaging and mechanical analysis of live cells and organisms under ambient conditions, however this technique allows for investigation of surfaces. Therefore, a different approach allowing for imaging and differentiation of nanoscale particles in wet samples is required. Dark-field microscopy as an optical microscopy technique has been popular among researchers, mostly for imaging relatively large specimens. In recent years, the so-called enhanced dark field microscopy based on using higher numerical aperture light condensers and variable numerical aperture objectives has emegred, which allows for imaging of nanoscale partides (starting from 5 nm nanospheres) using almost conventional optical microscopy methodology. Hyperspectral imaging can turn a dark-field optical microscope into a powerful chemical characterisation tool. As a result, this technique is becoming popular in environmental nanotoxicology studies. In this Review Article we introduce the reader into the methodology of enhanced dark-field and dark-field-based hyperspectral microscopy, covering the most important advances in this rapidly-expanding area of environmental nanotoxicology.

J;Photoacoustic imaging of lymphatic pumping;"The lymphatic system is responsible for fluid homeostasis and immune cell trafficking and has been implicated in several diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and cancer metastasis. Despite its importance, the lack of suitable in vivo imaging techniques has hampered our understanding of the lymphatic system. This is, in part, due to the limited contrast of lymphatic fluids and structures. Photoacoustic imaging, in combination with optically absorbing dyes or nanoparticles, has great potential for noninvasively visualizing the lymphatic vessels deep in tissues. Multispectral photoacoustic imaging is capable of separating the components; however, the slow wavelength switching speed of most laser systems is inadequate for imaging lymphatic pumping without motion artifacts being introduced into the processed images. We investigate two approaches for visualizing lymphatic processes in vivo. First, single-wavelength differential photoacoustic imaging is used to visualize lymphatic pumping in the hindlimb of a mouse in real time. Second, a fast-switching multiwavelength photoacoustic imaging system was used to assess the propulsion profile of dyes through the lymphatics in real time. These approaches may have profound impacts in noninvasively characterizing and investigating the lymphatic system. (C) The Authors.

J;Non-invasive in vitro and in vivo monitoring of degradation of fluorescently labeled hyaluronan hydrogels for tissue engineering applications;Tracking of degradation of hydrogels-based biomaterials in vivo is very important for rational design of tissue engineering scaffolds that act as delivery carriers for bioactive factors. During the process of tissue development, an ideal scaffold should remodel at a rate matching with scaffold degradation. To reduce amount of animals sacrificed, non-invasive in vivo imaging of biomaterials is required which relies on using of biocompatible and in situ gel forming compounds carrying suitable imaging agents. In this study we developed a method of in situ fabrication of fluorescently labeled and injectable hyaluronan (HA) hydrogel based on one pot sequential use of Michael addition and thiol-disulfide exchange reactions for the macromolecules labeling and cross-linking respectively. Hydrogels with different content of HA were prepared and their enzymatic degradation was followed in vitro and in vivo using fluorescence multispectral imaging. First, we confirmed that the absorbance of the matrix-linked near-IR fluorescent IRDye (R) 800CW agent released due to the matrix enzymatic degradation in vitro matched the amount of the degraded hydrogel measured by classical gravimetric method. Secondly, the rate of degradation was inversely proportional to the hydrogel concentration and this structure-degradation relationship was similar for both in vitro and in vivo studies. It implies that the degradation of this disulfide cross-linked hyaluronan hydrogel in vivo can be predicted basing on the results of its in vitro degradation studies. The compliance of in vitro and in vivo methods is also promising for the future development of predictive in vitro tissue engineering models. Statement of significance The need for engineered hydrogel scaffolds that deliver bioactive factors to endogenous progenitor cells in vivo via gradual matrix resorption and thus facilitate tissue regeneration is increasing with the aging population. Importantly, scaffold should degrade at a modest rate that will not be too fast to support tissue growth nor too slow to provide space for tissue development. The present work is devoted to longitudinal tracking of a hydrogel material in vivo from the time of its implantation to the time of complete resorption without sacrificing animals. The method demonstrates correlation of resorption rates in vivo and in vitro for hydrogels with varied structural parameters. It opens the possibility to develop predictive in vitro models for tissue engineered scaffolds and reduce animal studies. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J;Robust surface tracking combining features, intensity and illumination compensation;Recovering tissue deformation during robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery procedures is important for providing intra-operative guidance, enabling in vivo imaging modalities and enhanced robotic control. The tissue motion can also be used to apply motion stabilization and to prescribe dynamic constraints for avoiding critical anatomical structures. Image-based methods based independently on salient features or on image intensity have limitations when dealing with homogeneous soft tissues or complex reflectance. In this paper, we use a triangular geometric mesh model in order to combine the advantages of both feature and intensity information and track the tissue surface reliably and robustly. Synthetic and in vivo experiments are performed to provide quantitative analysis of the tracking accuracy of our method, and we also show exemplar results for registering multispectral images where there is only a weak image signal. Compared to traditional methods, our hybrid tracking method is more robust and has improved convergence in the presence of larger displacements, tissue dynamics and illumination changes.;2015;10.1007/s11548-015-1243-9
C;Real-time multispectral diffuse optical tomography system for imaging epileptic activity and connectivity;We describe a multispectral continuous-wave diffuse optical tomography (DOT) system that can be used for in vivo three-dimensional (3-D) imaging of seizure dynamics. Fast 3-D data acquisition is realized through a time multiplexing approach based on a parallel lighting configuration - our system can achieve 0.12ms per source per wavelength and up to 14Hz sampling rate for a full set of data for 3-D DOT image reconstruction. The system is validated using both static and dynamic tissue-like phantoms. In vivo rat experiments using both focal and generalized models of seizure are also demonstrated. In the focal seizure experiment, hemodynamic seizure focus was clearly detected and tracked. In the generalized seizure experiment, early hemodynamic responses with heterogeneous patterns were detected several minutes preceding the EEG onset of seizures and widespread hemodynamic changes were found evolving from local regions. Connectivity changes were also found during the development of seizures. This study demonstrates that DOT represents a powerful tool for investigating seizure generation and propagation, elucidating the causes and mechanism of seizures.;2013;10.1117/12.2009595
J;Hyperspectral data processing improves PpIX contrast during fluorescence guided surgery of human brain tumors;Fluorescence guided surgery (FGS) using aminolevulinic-acid (ALA) induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) provides intraoperative visual contrast between normal and malignant tissue during resection of high grade gliomas. However, maps of the PpIX biodistribution within the surgical field based on either visual perception or the raw fluorescence emissions can be masked by background signals or distorted by variations in tissue optical properties. This study evaluates the impact of algorithmic processing of hyperspectral imaging acquisitions on the sensitivity and contrast of PpIX maps. Measurements in tissue-simulating phantoms showed that (I) spectral fitting enhanced PpIX sensitivity compared with visible or integrated fluorescence, (II) confidence-filtering automatically determined the lower limit of detection based on the strength of the PpIX spectral signature in the collected emission spectrum (0.014-0.041 mu g/ml in phantoms), and (III) optical-property corrected PpIX estimates were more highly correlated with independent probe measurements (r = 0.98) than with spectral fitting alone (r = 0.91) or integrated fluorescence (r = 0.82). Application to in vivo case examples from clinical neurosurgeries revealed changes to the localization and contrast of PpIX maps, making concentrations accessible that were not visually apparent. Adoption of these methods has the potential to maintain sensitive and accurate visualization of PpIX contrast over the course of surgery.;2017;10.1038/s41598-017-09727-8
J;Real-time detection of breast cancer at the cellular level;Novel optoelectronic instrumentation has been developed for the multispectral imaging of autofluorescence emitted by metabolic fluorophores. The images resolve individual cells while spectra are collected for each pixel in the images. These datacubes are generated at a rate of 10 per second-fast enough for surgical guidance. The data is processed in real time to provide a single color-coded image to the surgeon. To date, the system has been applied to fresh, ex vivo, human surgical specimens and has distinguished breast cancer from benign tissue. The approach is applicable to in vivo measurements of surgical margins and needle-based optical biopsies. Ongoing work demonstrates that the system has great potential for translation to a hand-held probe with high sensitivity and specificity.;2019;10.1002/jcp.27451
C;Characterizing intraocular tumors with photoacoustic imaging;Intraocular tumors are life-threatening conditions. Long-term mortality from uveal melanoma, which accounts for 80% of primary intraocular tumors, could be as high as 25% depending on the size, ciliary body involvement and extraocular extension. The treatments of intraocular tumors include eye-sparing approaches such as radiotherapy and thermotherapy, and the more aggressive enucleation. The accurate diagnosis of intraocular tumors is thereby critical in the management and follow-up of the patients. The diagnosis of intraocular tumors is usually based on clinical examination with acoustic backscattering based ultrasonography. By analyzing the high frequency fluctuations within the ultrasound (US) signals, microarchitecture information inside the tumor can be characterized. However, US cannot interrogate the histochemical components formulating the microarchitecture. One representative example is the inability of US imaging (and other contemporary imaging modalities as well) in differentiating nevoid and melanoma cells as the two types of cells possesses similar acoustic backscattering properties. Combining optical and US imaging, photoacoustic (PA) measurements encode both the microarchitecture and histochemical component information in biological tissue. This study attempts to characterize ocular tumors by analyzing the high frequency signal components in the multispectral PA images. Ex vivo human eye globes with melanoma and retinoblastoma tumors were scanned using less than 6 mJ per square centimeters laser energy with tunable range of 600-1700 nm. A PA-US parallel imaging system with US probes CL15-7 and L22-14 were used to acquire the high frequency PA signals in real time. Preliminary results show that the proposed method can identify uveal melanoma against retinoblastoma tumors.;2016;10.1117/12.2212959
J;Hyperspectral multiphoton microscopy for in vivo visualization of multiple, spectrally overlapped fluorescent labels;The insensitivity of multiphoton microscopy to optical scattering enables high-resolution, high-contrast imaging deep into tissue, including in live animals. Scattering does, however, severely limit the use of spectral dispersion techniques to improve spectral resolution. In practice, this limited spectral resolution together with the need for multiple excitation wavelengths to excite different fluorophores limits multiphoton microscopy to imaging a few, spectrally distinct fluorescent labels at a time, restricting the complexity of biological processes that can be studied. Here, we demonstrate a hyperspectral multiphoton microscope that utilizes three different wavelength excitation sources together with multiplexed fluorescence emission detection using angle-tuned bandpass filters. This microscope maintains scattering insensitivity, while providing high enough spectral resolution on the emitted fluorescence and capitalizing on the wavelength-dependent nonlinear excitation of fluorescent dyes to enable clean separation of multiple, spectrally overlapping labels, in vivo. We demonstrated the utility of this instrument for spectral separation of closely overlapped fluorophores in samples containing 10 different colors of fluorescent beads, live cells expressing up to seven different fluorescent protein fusion constructs, and in multiple in vivo preparations in mouse cortex and inflamed skin, with up to eight different cell types or tissue structures distinguished.

C;Hyperspectral Imaging Method for Noninvasive Quantitative Detection of Vulvar Lichen Sclerosis: A Pilot Study;Vulvar lichen sclerosis (VLS) is a chronic mucocutaneous disorder, the pathogenesis of which is poorly understood. Few methods are available for noninvasive quantitative detection of VLS. Here, we proposed a hyper-spectral imaging method for in-vivo quantitative detection of VLS. An IRB approved clinical trial was carried out on three VLS patients and one patient with normal vulva as a control group. We acquired a hyper-spectral data cube of each patient with wavelengths ranging from 450 to 650 nm at an internal of 2 nm, followed by quantitative analysis of the spectral contribution of three known ingredients in skin tissues: Oxy-hemoglobin( HbO(2)), deoxy-hemoglobin(Hb) and melanin using an Independent Component Correlation Algorithm (ICA) method. Our analysis results suggested that the proportion of melanin and the total hemoglobin in VLS subjects were different from normal subjects. The segmentation of VLS regions based on the index of melanin and total hemoglobin are close to the VLS regions marked by a clinician. Our pilot study has firstly found the absorption spectra difference between normal vulva and VLS and demonstrated the technical potential of using this hyper-spectral imaging method for in-vivo quantitative detection of VLS.;2021;10.1117/12.2587670
J;Multi-Drug/Gene NASH Therapy Delivery and Selective Hyperspectral NIR Imaging Using Chirality-Sorted Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes;Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) can serve as drug delivery/biological imaging agents, as they exhibit intrinsic fluorescence in the near-infrared, allowing for deeper tissue imaging while providing therapeutic transport. In this work, CoMoCAT (Cobalt Molybdenum Catalyst) SWCNTs, chirality-sorted by aqueous two-phase extraction, are utilized for the first time to deliver a drug/gene combination therapy and image each therapeutic component separately via chirality-specific SWCNT fluorescence. Each of (7,5) and (7,6) sorted SWCNTs were non-covalently loaded with their specific payload: the PI3 kinase inhibitor targeting liver fibrosis or CCR5 siRNA targeting inflammatory pathways with the goal of addressing these processes in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), ultimately to prevent its progression to hepatocellular carcinoma. PX-866-(7,5) SWCNTs and siRNA-(7,6) SWCNTs were each imaged via characteristic SWCNT emission at 1024/1120 nm in HepG2 and HeLa cells by hyperspectral fluorescence microscopy. Wavelength-resolved imaging verified the intracellular transport of each SWCNT chirality and drug release. The therapeutic efficacy of each formulation was further demonstrated by the dose-dependent cytotoxicity of SWCNT-bound PX-866 and >90% knockdown of CCR5 expression with SWCNT/siRNA transfection. This study verifies the feasibility of utilizing chirality-sorted SWCNTs for the delivery and component-specific imaging of combination therapies, also suggesting a novel nanotherapeutic approach for addressing the progressions of NASH to hepatocellular carcinoma.;2019;10.3390/cancers11081175
J;In vivo tracking of orally-administered particles within the gastrointestinal tract of murine models using multispectral optoacoustic tomography;While particle carriers have potential to revolutionize disease treatment, using these carriers requires knowledge of spatial and temporal biodistribution. The goal of this study was to track orally administered particle uptake and trafficking through the murine gastrointestinal (GI) tract using multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT). Polylactic acid (PLA) particles encapsulating AlexaFluor 680 (AF680) dye conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) were orally gavaged into mice. Particle uptake and trafficking were observed using MSOT imaging with subsequent confirmation of particle uptake via fluorescent microscopy. Mice treated with PLA-AF680-BSA particles exhibited MSOT signal within the small bowel wall at 1 and 6 h, colon wall at 6, 12, and 24 h, and mesenteric lymph node 24 and 48 h. Particle localization identified using MSOT correlated with fluorescence microscopy. Despite the potential of GI tract motion artifacts, MSOT allowed for teal-time tracking of particles within the GI tract in a non-invasive and real-time manner. Future use of MSOT in conjunction with particles containing both protein-conjugated fluorophores as well as therapeutic agents could allow for non-invasive, real time tracking of particle uptake and drug delivery;2019;10.1016/j.pacs.2018.11.003
J;Monitoring wound healing in a 3D wound model by hyperspectral imaging and efficient clustering;Wound healing is a complex and dynamic process with different distinct and overlapping phases from homeostasis, inflammation and proliferation to remodelling. Monitoring the healing response of injured tissue is of high importance for basic research and clinical practice. In traditional application, biological markers characterize normal and abnormal wound healing. Understanding functional relationships of these biological processes is essential for developing new treatment strategies. However, most of the present techniques (in vitro or in vivo) include invasive microscopic or analytical tissue sampling. In the present study, a non-invasive alternative for monitoring processes during wound healing is introduced. Within this context, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an emerging and innovative non-invasive imaging technique with different opportunities in medical applications. HSI acquires the spectral reflectance of an object, depending on its biochemical and structural characteristics. An in-vitro 3-dimensional (3-D) wound model was established and incubated without and with acute and chronic wound fluid (AWF, CWF), respectively. Hyperspectral images of each individual specimen of this 3-D wound model were assessed at day 0/5/10 in vitro, and reflectance spectra were evaluated. For analysing the complex hyperspectral data, an efficient unsupervised approach for clustering massive hyperspectral data was designed, based on efficient hierarchical decomposition of spectral information according to archetypal data points. It represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of an advanced Data Mining approach in context of non-invasive analysis of wounds using hyperspectral imagery. By this, temporal and spatial pattern of hyperspectral clusters were determined within the tissue discs and among the different treatments. Results from non-invasive imaging were compared to the number of cells in the various clusters, assessed by Hematoxylin/Eosin (H/E) staining. It was possible to correlate cell quantity and spectral reflectance during wound closure in a 3-D wound model in vitro.;2017;10.1371/journal.pone.0186425
J;Noninvasive evaluation of hemodynamics and light scattering property during two-stage mouse cutaneous carcinogenesis based on multispectral diffuse reflectance images at isosbestic wavelengths of hemoglobin;We investigate a multispectral imaging method to evaluate spatiotemporal changes in both cutaneous hemoglobin concentration and light scattering parameter in mouse skin through diffuse reflectance spectroscopy using the reflectance images acquired at isosbestic wavelengths of hemoglobin (420, 450, 500, and 585 nm). In the proposed approach, Monte Carlo simulation-based empirical formulas are introduced to extract the scattering power b representing the wavelength dependence of light scattering spectrum of skin tissue, as well as the total hemoglobin concentration C-th in dermal vasculatures. The use of isosbestic wavelengths of hemoglobin enables the values of C-th and b to be estimated independently of the oxygenation of hemoglobin. Experiments using in vivo mice two-stage chemical carcinogenesis model are performed to confirm the feasibility of the proposed method for evaluating the changes in cutaneous vasculatures and tissue morphology during tumor initiation, promotion, and progression processes. The experimental results reveal that the changes in scattering power b of back skin are significantly reduced and followed by the increase in total hemoglobin concentration C-th in the carcinogenesis mice group, which indicates morphological changes in skin tissue such as edema and cell swelling caused by tumor promotion and successive angiogenesis along with tumor progression. The results suggest that the potential of the present method to detect cutaneous carcinogenesis in an early stage and monitor physiological changes during promotion and progression process of nonmelanoma tumors.

J;Tracers for Fluorescence-Guided Surgery: How Elongation of the Polymethine Chain in Cyanine Dyes Alters the Pharmacokinetics of a Dual-Modality c[RGDyK] Tracer;The potential of receptor-mediated fluorescence-based imageguided surgery tracers is generally linked to the near-infrared emission profile and good-manufacturing-production availability of fluorescent dyes. Surprisingly, little is known about the critical interaction between the structural composition of the dyes and the pharmacokinetics of the tracers. In this study, a dual-modality tracer design was used to systematically and quantitatively evaluate the influence of elongation of the polymethine chain in a fluorescent cyanine dye on the imaging potential of a targeted tracer. Methods: As a model system, the integrin marker alpha(nu)beta(3) was targeted using arginylglycylaspartisc acid [RGD]-based vectors functionalized with a In-111-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) chelate and a fluorescent dye: (Cy3-(SO3) methyl-COOH [emission wavelength (lambda(em)), 580 nm], Cy5-(SO3) methyl-COOH [lambda(em), 680 nm], or Cy7-(SO3) methyl-COOH [lambda(em), 780 nm]). Tracers were analyzed for differences in photophysical properties, serum protein binding, chemical or optical stability, and signal penetration through tissue. Receptor affinities were evaluated using saturation and competition experiments. In vivo biodistribution (SPECT imaging and percentage injected dose per gram of tissue) was assessed in tumor-bearing mice and complemented with in vivo and ex vivo fluorescence images obtained using a clinical-grade multispectral fluorescence laparoscope. Results: Two carbon-atom-step variations in the polymethine chain of the fluorescent cyanine dyes were shown to significantly influence the chemical and photophysical characteristics (e. g., stability, brightness, and tissue penetration) of the hybrid RGD tracers. DTPA-Cy5-(SO3) methyl-COOH-c[RGDyK] structurally outperformed its Cy3 and Cy7 derivatives. Radioactivity-based evaluation of in vivo tracer pharmacokinetics yielded the lowest nonspecific uptake and highest tumor-to-background ratio for DTPA-Cy5-(SO3) methyl-COOH-c[RGDyK] (13.2 +/- 1.7), with the Cy3 and Cy7 analogs trailing at respective tumor-to-background ratios of 5.7 +/- 0.7 and 4.7 +/- 0.7. Fluorescence-based assessment of tumor visibility revealed a similar trend. Conclusion: These findings underline that variations in the polymethine chain lengths of cyanine dyes have a profound influence on the photophysical properties, stability, and in vivo targeting capabilities of fluorescent imaging tracers. In a direct comparison, the intermediate-length dye (Cy5) yielded a superior c[RGDyK] tracer, compared with the shorter (Cy3) and longer (Cy7) analogs.;2018;10.2967/jnumed.117.205575
J;Sparse sampling for fast hyperspectral coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering imaging;We demonstrate a method to increase the acquisition speed in coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) hyperspectral imaging while retaining the relevant spectral information. The method first determines the important spectral components of a sample from a hyperspectral image over a small number of spatial points but a large number of spectral points covering the accessible spectral range and sampling the instrument spectral resolution at the Nyquist limit. From these components we determine a small set of frequencies needed to retrieve the weights of the components with minimum error for a given measurement noise. Hyperspectral images with a large number of spatial points, for example covering a large spatial region, are then measured at this small set of frequencies, and a reconstruction algorithm is applied to generate the full spectral range and resolution. The resulting spectra are suited to retrieve from the CARS intensity the CARS susceptibility which is linear in the concentration, and apply unsupervised quantitative analysis methods such as FSC3 [1]. We demonstrate the method on CARS hyperspectral images of human osteosarcoma U2OS cell, with a reduction in the acquisition time by a factor of 25. This method is suited also for other coherent vibrational microscopy techniques such as stimulated Raman scattering, and in general for hyperspectral imaging techniques with sequential spectral acquisition.

J;Polarization enhanced wide-field imaging for evaluating dermal changes caused by non-ablative fractional laser treatment;Background and ObjectiveLaser non-ablative fractional treatment (NAFT) is an important part of armamentarium of modern dermatology. Recently, such treatments have become available in at-home setting due to advent of self-application NAFT devices. Safety and clinical efficacy of NAFT are well established in multiple studies. Less information is available on morphological and functional changes in tissue occurring as a result of NAFT. Polarization-enhanced multispectral wide-field imaging device allows for in vivo real time visualization of dermal structures. The objective of this study is to use this imaging modality to monitor early effects of the home-use NAFT on collagen networks. Materials and MethodsEight subjects (skin types I-III) used a commercially available NAFT device (wavelength 1410nm, energy per pulse up to 15mJ) to treat peri-orbital wrinkles in standard recommended mode, that is daily, for a period of two weeks. In each session, subjects applied a pre-treatment gel to the peri-orbital areas and then used the device, delivering 8-10 applications to each side of the face without overlap. Subjects were asked to use the highest device setting. Cross-polarized 440nm wide-field images were acquired from peri-orbital areas before and two weeks after the onset of the treatment regimen. Wide-field images were normalized and thresholded to a level of 40% brightness to emphasize collagen structure. Collagen content was quantitatively determined from thresholded collagen images. Improvement in collagen content at two weeks of daily treatments was assessed. ResultsEight subjects (age 24-53 years) completed the study. Cross-polarized 440nm wide-field images clearly delineated collagen networks. Quantitative assessment of collagen images revealed statistically significant (P<0.05) improvement of collagen content at a time point of two weeks. Seven out of eight subjects showed varying degree of improvement. The increase of collagen content in responders ranged from 1-26%, with the mean improvement of 11%. Subjects in their early 40s showed the best improvement in comparison to younger and older age groups. ConclusionsPolarization-enhanced multispectral wide-field reflectance imaging method is a suitable technique for noninvasive in vivo assessment of dermal structures. Post-treatment images, taken three days after the last treatment session, demonstrate that non-ablative fractional treatment resulted in increased dermal collagen content as measured by the polarization-enhanced technique as early as two weeks post onset of the treatments. However, further studies with a larger number of subjects and longer treatment period are required to determine the optimal regimen and how long the results will last.

J;Wavelength optimization for rapid chromophore mapping using spatial frequency domain imaging;Spatial frequency-domain imaging (SFDI) utilizes multiple-frequency structured illumination and model-based computation to generate two-dimensional maps of tissue absorption and scattering properties. SFDI absorption data are measured at multiple wavelengths and used to fit for the tissue concentration of intrinsic chromophores in each pixel. This is done with a priori knowledge of the basis spectra of common tissue chromophores, such as oxyhemoglobin (ctO(2)Hb), deoxyhemoglobin (ctHHb), water (ctH(2)O), and bulk lipid. The quality of in vivo SFDI fits for the hemoglobin parameters ctO(2)Hb and ctHHb is dependent on wavelength selection, fitting parameters, and acquisition rate. The latter is critical because SFDI acquisition time is up to six times longer than planar two-wavelength multispectral imaging due to projection of multiple-frequency spatial patterns. Thus, motion artifact during in vivo measurements compromises the quality of the reconstruction. Optimal wavelength selection is examined through matrix decomposition of basis spectra, simulation of data, and dynamic in vivo measurements of a human forearm during cuff occlusion. Fitting parameters that minimize cross-talk from additional tissue chromophores, such as water and lipid, are determined. On the basis of this work, a wavelength pair of 670 nm/850 nm is determined to be the optimal two-wavelength combination for in vivo hemodynamic tissue measurements provided that assumptions for water and lipid fractions are made in the fitting process. In our SFDI case study, wavelength optimization reduces acquisition time over 30-fold to 1.5s compared to 50s for a full 34-wavelength acquisition. The wavelength optimization enables dynamic imaging of arterial occlusions with improved spatial resolution due to reduction of motion artifacts.

J;Spectral morphological analysis of skin lesions with a polarization multispectral dermoscope;Dermoscopy is the conventional technique used for the clinical inspection of human skin lesions. However, the identification of diagnostically relevant morphologies can become a complex task. We report on the development of a polarization multispectral dermoscope for the in vivo imaging of skin lesions. Linearly polarized illumination at three distinct spectral regions (470, 530 and 625 nm), is performed by high luminance LEDs. Processing of the acquired images, by means of spectral and polarization filtering, produces new contrast images, each one specific for melanin absorption, hemoglobin absorption, and single scattering. Analysis of such images could facilitate the identification of pathological morphologies. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America;2013;10.1364/OE.21.004826
J;ULTRASHORT PULSE MULTISPECTRAL NON-LINEAR OPTICAL MICROSCOPY;Ultrashort pulse, multispectral non-linear optical microscopy (NLOM) is developed and used to image, simultaneously, a mixed population of cells expressing different fluorescent protein mutants in a 3D tissue model of angiogenesis. Broadband, sub-10-fs pulses are used to excite multiple fluorescent proteins and generate second harmonic in collagen. A 16-channel multispectral detector is used to delineate the multiple non-linear optical signals, pixel by pixel, in NLOM. The ability to image multiple fluorescent protein mutants and collagen, enables serial measurements of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in our 3D tissue model and characterization of fundamental processes in angiogenic morphogenesis.;2009;10.1142/S1793545809000292
J;Wavelength optimization in the multispectral photoacoustic tomography of the lymphatic drainage in mice;Multispectral photoacoustic tomography provides mapping of the tissue chromophore distributions using sets of tunable laser wavelengths. With the overall goal of studying the dynamics of cerebrospinal fluid in mice in vivo, our work aims to minimize the number of wavelengths to reduce scanning time, improve the temporal resolution, reduce the energy deposition and avoid the tracer photobleaching while maintaining high image quality. To select small sets of wavelengths we directly searched for the combinations of wavelengths providing the best and worst image quality in comparison with a reference image obtained using 131 closely spaced wavelengths between 680 and 940 nm in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). We have shown that using the PSNR optimization method, additional improvements could be achieved over the wavelength set selected using the method of the minimization of the extinction matrix condition number.;2018;10.1016/j.pacs.2018.10.002
J;Prostate Cancer Localization With Multispectral MRI Using Cost-Sensitive Support Vector Machines and Conditional Random Fields;"Prostate cancer is a leading cause of cancer death for men in the United States. Fortunately, the survival rate for early diagnosed patients is relatively high. Therefore, in vivo imaging plays an important role for the detection and treatment of the disease. Accurate prostate cancer localization with noninvasive imaging can be used to guide biopsy, radiotheraphy, and surgery as well as to monitor disease progression. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed with an endorectal coil provides higher prostate cancer localization accuracy, when compared to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). However, in general, a single type of MRI is not sufficient for reliable tumor localization. As an alternative, multispectral MRI, i.e., the use of multiple MRI-derived datasets, has emerged as a promising noninvasive imaging technique for the localization of prostate cancer; however almost all studies are with human readers. There is a significant inter and intraobserver variability for human readers, and it is substantially difficult for humans to analyze the large dataset of multispectral MRI. To solve these problems, this study presents an automated localization method using cost-sensitive support vector machines (SVMs) and shows that this method results in improved localization accuracy than classical SVM. Additionally, we develop a new segmentation method by combining conditional random fields (CRF) with a cost-sensitive framework and show that our method further improves cost-sensitive SVM results by incorporating spatial information. We test SVM, cost-sensitive SVM, and the proposed cost-sensitive CRF on multispectral MRI datasets acquired from 21 biopsy-confirmed cancer patients. Our results show that multispectral MRI helps to increase the accuracy of prostate cancer localization when compared to single MR images; and that using advanced methods such as cost-sensitive SVM as well as the proposed cost-sensitive CRF can boost the performance significantly when compared to SVM.";2010;10.1109/TIP.2010.2048612
J;Relative quantitation of metal oxide nanoparticles in a cutaneous exposure model using enhanced darkfield microscopy and hyperspectral mapping;The biological effects associated with the unique properties of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) remain largely unknown. Animal models of exposure are valuable for assessing potential toxicity and adverse health effects. This study presents a method to determine relative quantitation of nanoparticle (NP) abundance in histological samples in an ex vivo model of cutaneous exposure to metal oxide NPs using enhanced darkfield microscopy (EDFM) with hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and mapping. Porcine skin tissue was topically exposed to alumina, ceria, and silica NPs using a modified Franz diffusion chamber and histologically prepared for imaging. EDFM allowed for rapid direct visualization of NPs, while hyperspectral mapping confirmed the composition of NPs throughout the tissue, based on positive matching of pixels to reference spectral libraries (RSLs). Relative quantitation of NPs was achieved based on calculating the percentage of mapped pixels per field of view (FOV). The greatest abundance of mapped NPs was found in the ceria-exposed group regardless of tissue layer, relative to the other groups. Fewer NPs were found in the dermis compared to the stratum corneum in both the aluminaand ceria-exposed groups. This study demonstrated EDFM-HSI as a valuable method to determine relative quantitation of NPs in histological samples. The methods put forth in this study could be adapted for application to other NP types as well as other biological or environmental matrices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

C;Non-linear optical imaging and fibre-based spectroscopy of fresh colon biopsies;Two-photon fluorescence (TPEF) microscopy is a powerful tool to image human tissues up to 200 microns depth without any exogenously added probe. TPEF can take advantage of the autofluorescence of molecules intrinsically contained in a biological tissue, as such NADH, elastin, collagen, and flavins. Two-photon microscopy has been already successfully used to image several types of tissues, including skin, muscles, tendons, bladder. Nevertheless, its usefulness in imaging colon tissue has not been deeply investigated yet. In this work we have used combined two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF), second harmonic generation microscopy (SHG), fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and multispectral two-photon emission detection (MTPE) to investigate different kinds of human ex-vivo fresh biopsies of colon. Morphological and spectroscopic analyses allowed to characterize both healthy mucosa, polyp, and colon samples in a good agreement with common routine histology. Even if further analysis, as well as a more significant statistics on a large number of samples would be helpful to discriminate between low, mild, and high grade cancer, our method is a promising tool to be used as diagnostic confirmation of histological results, as well as a diagnostic tool in a multiphoton endoscope or colonoscope to be used in in-vivo imaging applications.;2012;10.1117/12.922388
J;Rapid multispectral endoscopic imaging system for near real-time mapping of the mucosa blood supply in the lung;We have developed a fast multispectral endoscopic imaging system that is capable of acquiring images in 18 optimized spectral bands spanning 400-760 nm by combining a customized light source with six triple-band filters and a standard color CCD camera. A method is developed to calibrate the spectral response of the CCD camera. Imaging speed of 15 spectral image cubes/second is achieved. A spectral analysis algorithm based on a linear matrix inversion approach is developed and implemented in a graphics processing unit (GPU) to map the mucosa blood supply in the lung in vivo. Clinical measurements on human lung patients are demonstrated. (C)2015 Optical Society of America;2015;10.1364/BOE.6.002980
J;Novel approaches to imaging basal cell carcinoma;The gold standard of diagnosis for nonmelanoma and melanoma skin cancer has been skin biopsy with routine paraffin embedded hematoxylin and eosin histopathology. This practice is frequently carried out on suspicious lesions to rule out a malignant process. Therefore, as a result, many biopsies are done on benign lesions. Unlike other fields of medicine that rely on noninvasive imaging modalities, the use of imaging devices in dermatology has not been as robust. This has been mainly due to the limited resolution offered by imaging devices that is needed to detect malignant changes in the cutaneous layers. However, the demand for more efficient in vivo and ex vivo imaging tools to reduce the amount of biopsies have led to new areas of investigation using noninvasive modalities to augment the clinical diagnosis of skin cancer. The use of noninvasive imaging both in vivo and ex vivo has the potential to increase efficiency of diagnosis and management, decrease healthcare cost, improve clinical care and enhance patient satisfaction.;2015;10.2217/fon.15.231
J;First-in-human pilot study of snapshot multispectral endoscopy for early detection of Barrett's-related neoplasia;". Significance: The early detection of dysplasia in patients with Barrett's esophagus could improve outcomes by enabling curative intervention; however, dysplasia is often inconspicuous using conventional white-light endoscopy. Aim: We sought to determine whether multispectral imaging (MSI) could be applied in endoscopy to improve detection of dysplasia in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Approach: We used a commercial fiberscope to relay imaging data from within the upper GI tract to a snapshot MSI camera capable of collecting data from nine spectral bands. The system was deployed in a pilot clinical study of 20 patients (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03388047) to capture 727 in vivo image cubes matched with gold-standard diagnosis from histopathology. We compared the performance of seven learning-based methods for data classification, including linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbor classification, and a neural network. Results: Validation of our approach using a Macbeth color chart achieved an image-based classification accuracy of 96.5%. Although our patient cohort showed significant intra- and interpatient variance, we were able to resolve disease-specific contributions to the recorded MSI data. In classification, a combined principal component analysis and k-nearest-neighbor approach performed best, achieving accuracies of 95.8%, 90.7%, and 76.1%, respectively, for squamous, non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus and neoplasia based on majority decisions per-image. Conclusions: MSI shows promise for disease classification in Barrett's esophagus and merits further investigation as a tool in high-definition chip-on-tip endoscopes.";2021;10.1117/1.JBO.26.10.106002
J;Dual-Modality Imaging of the Human Finger Joint Systems by Using Combined Multispectral Photoacoustic Computed Tomography and Ultrasound Computed Tomography;We developed a homemade dual-modality imaging system that combines multispectral photoacoustic computed tomography and ultrasound computed tomography for reconstructing the structural and functional information of human finger joint systems. The fused multispectral photoacoustic-ultrasound computed tomography (MPAUCT) system was examined by the phantom and in vivo experimental tests. The imaging results indicate that the hard tissues such as the bones and the soft tissues including the blood vessels, the tendon, the skins, and the subcutaneous tissues in the finger joints systems can be effectively recovered by using our multimodality MPAUCT system. The developed MPAUCT system is able to provide us with more comprehensive information of the human finger joints, which shows its potential for characterization and diagnosis of bone or joint diseases.;2016;10.1155/2016/1453272
J;Human tissue cultures of lung cancer predict patient susceptibility to immune-checkpoint inhibition;Despite novel immunotherapies being approved and established for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ex vivo models predicting individual patients' responses to immunotherapies are missing. Especially immune modulating therapies with moderate response rates urge for biomarkers and/or assays to determine individual prediction of treatment response and investigate resistance mechanisms. Here, we describe a standardized ex vivo tissue culture model to investigate individual tumor responses. NSCLC tissue cultures preserve morphological characteristics of the baseline tumor specimen for up to 12 days ex vivo and also maintain T-cell function for up to 10 days ex vivo. A semi-automated analysis of proliferating and apoptotic tumor cells was used to evaluate tissue responses to the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (n = 12), from which two cases could be successfully correlated to the clinical outcome. T-cell responses upon nivolumab treatment were investigated by flow cytometry and multispectral imaging. Alterations in the frequency of the Treg population and reorganization of tumor tissues could be correlated to nivolumab responsiveness ex vivo. Thus, our findings not only demonstrate the functionality of T cells in NSCLC slice cultures up to 10 days ex vivo, but also suggests this model for stratifying patients for treatment selection and to investigate in depth the tumor-associated T-cell regulation.;2021;10.1038/s41420-021-00651-5
J;Band-Selection of a Portal LED-Induced Autofluorescence Multispectral Imager to Improve Oral Cancer Detection;This aim of this study was to find effective spectral bands for the early detection of oral cancer. The spectral images in different bands were acquired using a self-made portable light-emitting diode (LED)-induced autofluorescence multispectral imager equipped with 365 and 405 nm excitation LEDs, emission filters with center wavelengths of 470, 505, 525, 532, 550, 595, 632, 635, and 695 nm, and a color image sensor. The spectral images of 218 healthy points in 62 healthy participants and 218 tumor points in 62 patients were collected in the ex vivo trials at China Medical University Hospital. These ex vivo trials were similar to in vivo because the spectral images of anatomical specimens were immediately acquired after the on-site tumor resection. The spectral images associated with red, blue, and green filters correlated with and without nine emission filters were quantized by four computing method, including summated intensity, the highest number of the intensity level, entropy, and fractional dimension. The combination of four computing methods, two excitation light sources with two intensities, and 30 spectral bands in three experiments formed 264 classifiers. The quantized data in each classifier was divided into two groups: one was the training group optimizing the threshold of the quantized data, and the other was validating group tested under this optimized threshold. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of each classifier were derived from these tests. To identify the influential spectral bands based on the area under the region and the testing results, a single-layer network learning process was used. This was compared to conventional rules-based approaches to show its superior and faster performance. Consequently, four emission filters with the center wavelengths of 470, 505, 532, and 550 nm were selected by an AI-based method and verified using a rule-based approach. The sensitivities of six classifiers using these emission filters were more significant than 90%. The average sensitivity of these was about 96.15%, the average specificity was approximately 69.55%, and the average accuracy was about 82.85%.;2021;10.3390/s21093219
J;Combined non-linear laser imaging (two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, multispectral multiphoton microscopy) in cutaneous tumours: first experiences;Two-photon excitation (TPE) fluorescence microscopy is a high-resolution laser-scanning imaging technique enabling deep imaging inside biological tissues. TPE microscopy has the triple advantage of offering high spatial resolution (250 nm radially, 800 nm axially), high penetration depth inside skin (200mm ), and low photodamage effects. Further, cells and extracellular matrix intrinsically contain a variety of fluorescent molecules (NADH, tryptophan, keratins, melanin, elastin, cholecalciferol and others), so that biological tissues can be imaged by TPE microscopy without any exogenous probe. The time-resolved analysis of the fluorescence signal, known as fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), is an additional non-invasive microscopy technique useful to characterize endogenous fluorescence species and their surrounding medium by measuring the mean lifetime of fluorescent emission. Finally, multispectral (MTPE) tissue imaging can also be used to identify different endogenous fluorescent species by measuring their two photon emission spectra. Those techniques offer functional information about the relative quantities of fluorescent molecules, which are correlated with tissue structure in physiological and pathological states. We have decided to apply these three methods at the same time for cutaneous tumors in order to evaluate their possible future use. We have analyzed a melanoma and a basal cell carcinoma, with their surrounding healthy skin, to evaluate any difference in healthy skin and neoplasia. The samples were excised during dermatological surgery, then cut, saving some healthy skin in both, to obtain a regular shape, allowing its positioning either with the skin surface parallel to the optical axis (horizontal optical sectioning), or perpendicular (vertical optical sectioning). This first result demonstrates that FLIM is effective in discriminating healthy skin from MM, while MTPE is effective in discriminating healthy skin from BCC.

J;Targeted Noninvasive Imaging of EGFR-Expressing Orthotopic Pancreatic Cancer Using Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography;Detection of orthotopic xenograft tumors is difficult due to poor spatial resolution and reduced image fidelity with traditional optical imaging modalities. In particular, light scattering and attenuation in tissue at depths beyond subcutaneous implantation hinder adequate visualization. We evaluate the use of multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) to detect upregulated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor in orthotopic pancreatic xenografts using a near-infrared EGF-conjugated CF-750 fluorescent probe. MSOT is based on the photoacoustic effect and thus not limited by photon scattering, resulting in high-resolution tomographic images. Pancreatic tumor-bearing mice with luciferase-transduced S2VP10L tumors were intravenously injected with EGF-750 probe before MSOT imaging. We characterized probe specificity and bioactivity via immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometric analysis. In vitro data along with optical bioluminescence/fluorescence imaging were used to validate acquired MSOT in vivo images of probe biodistribution. Indocyanine green dye was used as a nonspecific control to define specificity of EGF-probe accumulation. Maximum accumulation occurred at 6 hours postinjection, demonstrating specific intratumoral probe uptake and minimal liver and kidney off-target accumulation. Optical bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging confirmed tumor-specific probe accumulation consistent with MSOT images. These studies demonstrate the utility of MSOT to obtain volumetric images of ligand probe biodistribution in vivo to detect orthotopic pancreatic tumor lesions through active targeting of the EGF receptor.

J;Novel automated non invasive detection of ocular surface squamous neoplasia using multispectral autofluorescence imaging;Purpose: Diagnosing Ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) using newly designed multispectral imaging technique. Methods: Eighteen patients with histopathological diagnosis of Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia (OSSN) were recruited. Their previously collected biopsy specimens of OSSN were reprocessed without staining to obtain auto fluorescence multispectral microscopy images. This technique involved a custom-built spectral imaging system with 38 spectral channels. Inter and intra-patient frameworks were deployed to automatically detect and delineate OSSN using machine learning methods. Different machine learning methods were evaluated, with K nearest neighbor and Support Vector Machine chosen as preferred classifiers for intra- and inter-patient frameworks, respectively. The performance of the technique was evaluated against a pathological assessment. Results: Quantitative analysis of the spectral images provided a strong multispectral signature of a relative difference between neoplastic and normal tissue both within each patient (at p < 0.0005) and between patients (at p < 0.001). Our fully automated diagnostic method based on machine learning produces maps of the relatively well circumscribed neoplastic-non neoplastic interface. Such maps can be rapidly generated in quasi-real time and used for intraoperative assessment. Generally, OSSN could be detected using multispectral analysis in all patients investigated here. The cancer margins detected by multispectral analysis were in close and reasonable agreement with the margins observed in the H&E sections in intra- and inter-patient classification, respectively. Conclusions: This study shows the feasibility of using multispectral auto-fluorescence imaging to detect and find the boundary of human OSSN. Fully automated analysis of multispectral images based on machine learning methods provides a promising diagnostic tool for OSSN which can be translated to future clinical applications.;2019;10.1016/j.jtos.2019.03.003
C;OPTICAL IMAGING AND SPECTROSCOPY OF SUPERFICIAL TISSUE;Three techniques used for imaging superficial tissue are described. Firstly a novel polarized light capillaroscope has been developed for imaging the microcirculation. The capillaroscope has been used to make in vivo measurements of sickle cell disorder sufferers. Secondly hyperspectral imaging for measuring oxygen saturation is described. The accuracy of such measurements is affected by the non-linear relationship between scattering and absorption and it is demonstrated that polarization techniques can be used to make the relationship more linear, thus improving accuracy. Finally the use of smart CMOS optical sensors, for laser Doppler blood flowmetry is described. Through the design of a 4x4 pixel imaging array with on-chip processing the potential for full field laser Doppler blood flow imaging is demonstrated.;2008;10.1142/9789812832344_0003
J;Quantitative gene analysis of methylation and expression (Q-GAME) in fresh or fixed cells and tissues;Epigenetic regulation of gene expression by DNA methylation is a central mechanism governing the silencing of tumor suppressor genes in many forms of cancer. Current methods have not proven optimal for the quantitative analysis of DNA methylation and corresponding in situ protein expression within cells in small specimens like skin biopsies. We have overcome this limitation by combining and modifying several techniques: target cell enrichment, DNA micro-isolation, one-step denaturation/bisulphite conversion/in-column desulphonation, specially designed PCR amplification, pyrosequencing and multispectral image analysis. Using this approach optimized for small samples, we can quantify minor alterations in gene methylation and protein expression using minimal amounts of tissue. Comparative studies of fresh and processed cells showed that our method is valid for DNA in both fresh and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens. We can measure the effects of DNA methylation inhibitors, administered in vitro or in vivo, on the promoter methylation and protein expression of selected genes in specific cells. This novel approach should prove useful for a wide variety of investigative and clinical applications in dermatology and other specialties where the collection of small, routinely processed biopsy specimens is common. We refer to this method as Q-GAME (quantitative gene analysis of methylation and expression).;2014;10.1111/exd.12374
C;Sensitivity Analysis-Based Time Gate Selection Procedure for Biexponential Fluorescence Imaging;Fluorescence lifetime imaging is an essential analytical tool in studies of cells and tissues. Recently, translation of the technique from microscopy to in vivo or with augmented data (hyperspectral) is being developed. One major concern for these new implementations reside in the lengthy acquisition times required. Data reduction techniques are one approach to significantly reduce the imaging protocol times. Herein, a sensitivity analysis framework is developed for the multifaceted, high-dimensional problems of current and future applications of fluorescence imaging. This framework is applied to the temporal dimension of lifetime-based Frster resonance energy transfer imaging. Synthetic data is used to show acquisition time can be reduced by an order of magnitude with almost no decrease in parameter estimation accuracy.;2015;
J;Intraoperative In Vivo Imaging Modalities in Head and Neck Cancer Surgical Margin Delineation: A Systematic Review;Simple Summary The complete removal of cancerous tissue is an important predictor of patient outcomes after surgery, in particular for head and neck cancer surgery. Normally, surgical tissues are examined by a pathologist to determine whether a full removal of the cancer was performed. However, these analyses are often imperfect due to time constraints, limitations in frozen sections, and tissue orientation challenges. Newer intraoperative imaging techniques have shown great promise for increasing both the accuracy and efficiency of this process while in the operating room. This review summarizes and analyzes the current state of the literature on intraoperative imaging in determining cancer margins in head and neck cancers. Surgical margin status is one of the strongest prognosticators in predicting patient outcomes in head and neck cancer, yet head and neck surgeons continue to face challenges in the accurate detection of these margins with the current standard of care. Novel intraoperative imaging modalities have demonstrated great promise for potentially increasing the accuracy and efficiency in surgical margin delineation. In this current study, we collated and analyzed various intraoperative imaging modalities utilized in head and neck cancer to evaluate their use in discriminating malignant from healthy tissues. The authors conducted a systematic database search through PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and EBSCOhost (CINAHL). Study screening and data extraction were performed and verified by the authors, and more studies were added through handsearching. Here, intraoperative imaging modalities are described, including optical coherence tomography, narrow band imaging, autofluorescence, and fluorescent-tagged probe techniques. Available sensitivities and specificities in delineating cancerous from healthy tissues ranged from 83.0% to 100.0% and 79.2% to 100.0%, respectively, across the different imaging modalities. Many of these initial studies are in small sample sizes, with methodological differences that preclude more extensive quantitative comparison. Thus, there is impetus for future larger studies examining and comparing the efficacy of these intraoperative imaging technologies.;2022;10.3390/cancers14143416
J;Hyperspectral imaging with in-line interferometric femtosecond stimulated Raman scattering spectroscopy;We present the hyperspectral imaging capabilities of in-line interferometric femtosecond stimulated Raman scattering. The beneficial features of this method, namely, the improved signal-to-background ratio compared to other applicable broadband stimulated Raman scattering methods and the simple experimental implementation, allow for a rather fast acquisition of three-dimensional raster-scanned hyperspectral data-sets, which is shown for PMMA beads and a lipid droplet in water as a demonstration. A subsequent application of a principle component analysis displays the chemical selectivity of the method. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.;2014;10.1063/1.4865939
J;Retinal Organoids Long-Term Functional Characterization Using Two-Photon Fluorescence Lifetime and Hyperspectral Microscopy;Pluripotent stem cell-derived organoid technologies have opened avenues to preclinical basic science research, drug discovery, and transplantation therapy in organ systems. Stem cell-derived organoids follow a time course similar to species-specific organ gestation in vivo. However, heterogeneous tissue yields, and subjective tissue selection reduce the repeatability of organoid-based scientific experiments and clinical studies. To improve the quality control of organoids, we introduced a live imaging technique based on two-photon microscopy to non-invasively monitor and characterize retinal organoids' (RtOgs') long-term development. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) was used to monitor the metabolic trajectory, and hyperspectral imaging was applied to characterize structural and molecular changes. We further validated the live imaging experimental results with endpoint biological tests, including quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), single-cell RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemistry. With FLIM results, we analyzed the free/bound nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (f/b NADH) ratio of the imaged regions and found that there was a metabolic shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation. This shift occurred between the second and third months of differentiation. The total metabolic activity shifted slightly back toward glycolysis between the third and fourth months and stayed relatively stable between the fourth and sixth months. Consistency in organoid development among cell lines and production lots was examined. Molecular analysis showed that retinal progenitor genes were expressed in all groups between days 51 and 159. Photoreceptor gene expression emerged around the second month of differentiation, which corresponded to the shift in the f/b NADH ratio. RtOgs between 3 and 6 months of differentiation exhibited photoreceptor gene expression levels that were between the native human fetal and adult retina gene expression levels. The occurrence of cone opsin expression (OPN1 SW and OPN1 LW) indicated the maturation of photoreceptors in the fourth month of differentiation, which was consistent with the stabilized level of f/b NADH ratio starting from 4 months. Endpoint single-cell RNA and immunohistology data showed that the cellular compositions and lamination of RtOgs at different developmental stages followed those in vivo.;2021;10.3389/fncel.2021.796903
J;Hyperspectral Imaging with Stimulated Raman Scattering by Chirped Femtosecond Lasers;Raman microscopy is a quantitative, label-free, and noninvasive optical imaging technique for studying inhomogeneous systems. However, the feebleness of Raman scattering significantly limits the use of Raman microscopy to low time resolutions and primarily static samples. Recent developments in narrowband stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy have significantly increased the acquisition speed of Raman based label-free imaging by a,few orders of magnitude, at the expense of reduced spectroscopic information. On the basis of a spectral focusing approach, we present a fast SRS hyperspectral imaging system using chirped femtosecond lasers to achieve rapid Raman spectra acquisition while retaining the full speed and image quality of narrowband SRS imaging. We demonstrate that quantitative concentration determination of cholesterol in the presence of interfering chemical species can be achieved with sensitivity down to 4 mM. For imaging purposes, hyperspectral imaging data in the C-H stretching region is obtained within a minute. We show that mammalian cell SRS hyperspectral imaging reveals the spatially inhomogeneous distribution of saturated lipids, unsaturated lipids, cholesterol, and protein. The combination of fast spectroscopy and label free chemical imaging will enable new applications in studying biological systems and material systems.;2013;10.1021/jp308938t
C;Multimode optical dermoscopy (SkinSpect (TM)) analysis for skin with melanocytic nevus;We have developed a multimode dermoscope (SkinSpect (TM)) capable of illuminating human skin samples in-vivo with spectrally-programmable linearly-polarized light at 33 wavelengths between 468nm and 857 nm. Diffusely reflected photons are separated into collinear and cross-polarized image paths and images captured for each illumination wavelength. In vivo human skin nevi (N = 20) were evaluated with the multimode dermoscope and melanin and hemoglobin concentrations were compared with Spatially Modulated Quantitative Spectroscopy (SMoQS) measurements. Both systems show low correlation between their melanin and hemoglobin concentrations, demonstrating the ability of the SkinSpect (TM) to separate these molecular signatures and thus act as a biologically plausible device capable of early onset melanoma detection.;2016;10.1117/12.2214288
C;Small Animal Optical Multispectral Cerenkov Tomography;A novel pre-clinical imaging modality called Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) has been recently introduced for small animals in vivo imaging. CLI is based on the detection of optical Cerenkov radiation generated by beta particles as they travel into the animal tissues with energy greater than Cerenkov threshold. The main goal of this work is the development of a novel optical image reconstruction method called multi spectral Cerenkov luminescence tomography (msCLT). The starting point of the msCLT reconstruction scheme is a set of 2D planar images acquired using several narrow bandpass filters. Because of the different tissues absorption at different wavelengths this provide distinctive information content that can be used for image reconstruction. More precisely the msCLT algorithm is based on a regularized iterative non-negative scheme in order to find the unknown source intensity solution, the theoretical Cerenkov emission spectrum was also included in the algorithm. In order to investigate the performances of the msCLT approach in vitro and in vivo imaging using (32)p-ATP were performed by using the IVIS 200 (Caliper, a PerkinElmer company). A set of spatial resolution measurements were performed using a small capillary source placed between several slices of chicken breast at different depths. The spatial resolution obtained from the msCLT reconstructed images of the capillary showed that the FWHM is 1.5 mm for a source placed at 6 mm depth. In order to investigate the in vivo performances of the msCLT reconstruction method, a control nude mice injected with 10 MBq of 32P-ATP were imaged. Whole body MRI was acquired to provide an anatomical localization of the Cerenkov emission. msCLT reconstructed images co-registered with MRI images showed that the Cerenkov emission regions matches well with anatomical regions, such as the brain, heart and abdomen. These results were also confirmed by ex vivo imaging of organs such as intestine, brain, heart and ribs.;2011;
J;Enhanced hyperspectral tomography for bioimaging by spatiospectral reconstruction;Here we apply hyperspectral bright field imaging to collect computed tomographic images with excellent energy resolution (similar to 1 keV), applying it for the first time to map the distribution of stain in a fixed biological sample through its characteristic K-edge. Conventionally, because the photons detected at each pixel are distributed across as many as 200 energy channels, energy-selective images are characterised by low count-rates and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This means high X-ray exposures, long scan times and high doses are required to image unique spectral markers. Here, we achieve high quality energy-dispersive tomograms from low dose, noisy datasets using a dedicated iterative reconstruction algorithm. This exploits the spatial smoothness and inter-channel structural correlation in the spectral domain using two carefully chosen regularisation terms. For a multi-phase phantom, a reduction in scan time of 36 times is demonstrated. Spectral analysis methods including K-edge subtraction and absorption step-size fitting are evaluated for an ex vivo, single (iodine)-stained biological sample, where low chemical concentration and inhomogeneous distribution can affect soft tissue segmentation and visualisation. The reconstruction algorithms are available through the open-source Core Imaging Library. Taken together, these tools offer new capabilities for visualisation and elemental mapping, with promising applications for multiply-stained biological specimens.;2021;10.1038/s41598-021-00146-4
J;A Molecular Imaging Paradigm to Rapidly Profile Response to Angiogenesis-directed Therapy in Small Animals;The development of novel angiogenesis-directed therapeutics is hampered by the lack of non-invasive imaging metrics capable of assessing treatment response. We report the development and validation of a novel molecular imaging paradigm to rapidly assess response to angiogenesis-directed therapeutics in preclinical animal models. A monoclonal antibody-based optical imaging probe targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) expression was synthesized and evaluated in vitro and in vivo via multispectral fluorescence imaging. The optical imaging agent demonstrated specificity for the target receptor in cultured endothelial cells and in vivo. The agent exhibited significant accumulation within 4T1 xenograft tumors. Mice bearing 4T1 xenografts and treated with sunitinib exhibited both tumor growth arrest and decreased accumulation of NIR800-alpha VEGFR2ab compared to untreated cohorts (p = 0.0021). Molecular imaging of VEGFR2 expression is a promising non-invasive biomarker for assessing angiogenesis and evaluating the efficacy of angiogenesis-directed therapies.;2009;10.1007/s11307-008-0193-9
J;In vivo validation of tissue segmentation based on a 3D feature map using both a hamster brain tumor model and stereotactically guided biopsy of brain tumors in man;The purpose of this study was to validate our MR tissue segmentation technique using a hamster brain tumor model and malignant brain tumors in man. We used a multispectral tissue segmentation analysis. Three sets of MRI data were included: proton density, T2-weighted fast spin echo, and T1-weighted spin echo, as inputs. Three image preprocessing steps included correcting image nonuniformity, application of an anisotropic diffusion type filter, and data point selection by a qualified observer. We used the Er-Nearest Neighbor segmentation algorithm, which does not require prior knowledge of the sample distribution. This choice allowed us to optimize the different tissue clusters present in three-dimensional (3D) feature space. In vivo validation of the technique was performed in hamsters harboring tumors induced with JC virus-transformed HJC-15 cells, as compared to three control animals. Human brain tumors obtained by stereotactically guided biopsy in six patients were also included in the study. Finally, brain tumors were removed from two patients who underwent conventional craniotomy using segmentation-derived images as a guide. In the hamsters, 10 tissues were correctly identified by segmentation and were confirmed histologically (P <.02). In the patients, there was also a strong correlation between our segmentation results and the tissue obtained by stereotactic biopsy (P <.01). In one of the two patients who underwent open craniotomy, segmentation images were useful in revealing tumor spread into vital areas of the brain (motor area). In conclusion, the results of segmentation correlate well with the tissues in vivo and thus warrant further clinical utilization and evaluation.;1998;10.1002/jmri.1880080410
J;Protoporphyrin incorporated alginate hydrogel: preparation, characterization and fluorescence imaging in vivo;Fluorescence imaging provides a non-invasive tool for locating, monitoring and tracking implanted biomaterials in situ. Since alginate hydrogels have been widely applied as scaffolds for tissue engineering, delivery carriers or extracellular matrices, the in vivo status of alginate hydrogels is necessary and important to their applications. Herein, a protoporphyrin incorporated alginate hydrogel was prepared using PEG as a linker. The structure and properties were investigated with rheological analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, and UV-visible and fluorescence spectrophotometry. Hydrogel erosion and drug delivery in vivo were monitored and tracked using a multispectral fluorescence imaging system with nude mice as models. The results show that the protoporphyrin incorporated alginate hydrogel exhibits fluorescence ability in vivo with good biocompatibility. With the guidance of fluorescence imaging, the in vivo status of hydrogels can be reflected in situ. Protoporphyrin based biomaterials have potential for application in in vivo monitoring and tracking using fluorescence imaging.;2015;10.1039/c5ra19285d
J;Current and Emerging Clinical Applications of Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) in Oncology;"Accurate detection and characterization of cancers are key for providing timely intervention and effective treatments. Current imaging technologies are particularly limited when it comes to detecting very small tumors in vivo, i.e., very early cancers or metastases, differentiating viable tumor from surrounding dead tumor tissue, and evaluating tumor metabolism within tissue. Optoacoustic imaging offers potential solutions to these imaging problems because of its ability to image optical absorption properties of both intrinsic tissue chromophores and exogenous contrast agents without the involvement of ionizing radiation. Optoacoustic imaging uses pulsed laser to induce localized thermoelastic expansion that generates acoustic waves detectable by an ultrasound transducer. To date, multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) has primarily been used in preclinical research; however, its use in translational and clinical research is expanding. This review focuses on current and emerging applications of optoacoustic imaging for molecular imaging of cancer using both exogenous and endogenous contrast agents and sheds light on potential future clinical applications.

J;A polarized multispectral imaging system for quantitative assessment of hypertrophic scars;Hypertrophic scars (HTS) are a pathologic reaction of the skin and soft tissue to burn or other traumatic injury. Scar tissue can cause patients serious functional and cosmetic issues. Scar management strategies, specifically scar assessment techniques, are vital to improve clinical outcome. To date, no entirely objective method for scar assessment has been embraced by the medical community. In this study, we introduce for the first time, a novel polarized multispectral imaging system combining out-of-plane Stokes polarimetry and Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging (SFDI). This imaging system enables us to assess the pathophysiology (hemoglobin, blood oxygenation, water, and melanin) and structural features (cellularity and roughness) of HTS. To apply the proposed technique in an in vivo experiment, dermal wounds were created in a porcine model and allowed to form into scars. The developed scars were then measured at various time points using the imaging system. Results showed a good agreement with clinical Vancouver Scar Scale assessment and histological examinations.

J;Spectrally programmable light engine for in vitro or in vivo molecular imaging and spectroscopy;A spectrally and temporally programmable light engine can create any spectral profile for hyperspectral, fluorescence, or principal-component imaging or with medical photonics devices employing spectroscopy, microscopy, and endoscopy. Multispectral imaging feasibility was demonstrated by capturing nine images at wavelengths from 450 to 650 mm (25-nm FWHM) with a CCD-camera-equipped bronchoscope coupled to the light engine. Selected wavelength regions were combined to produce a color endoscopy image. (c) 2005 Optical Society of America.;2005;10.1364/AO.44.002033
J;Relaxo-volumetric multispectral quantitative magnetic resonance imaging of the brain over the human lifespan: global and regional aging patterns;"The objective of this study-was to determine the T1, T2 and secular-T2 relaxo-volumetric brain aging patterns using multispectral quantitative magnetic resonance imaging, both globally and regionally, and covering an age range approaching the full human lifespan. Fifty-one subjects (28 males, 23 females; age range: 0.5-87 years) were studied consisting of 18 healthy volunteers and 33 patients. Patients were selected after carefully reviewing their radiology reports to have either normal-by-MRI findings (25 patient subjects) or small focal pathology less than 6 mm in size (eight patient subjects). All subjects were MR imaged at 1.5 T with the mixed turbo spin echo pulse sequence. The soft tissues inside the cranial vault, termed intracranial matter (ICM), were segmented using a dual-clustering segmentation algorithm. ICM segments were further divided into six subsegments: bilateral anterior cerebral, posterior cerebral and cerebellar subsegments. T1, T2 and secular-T2 relaxation time histograms of all segments were generated and modeled with Gaussian functions. For each segment, the volumes of white matter, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid were calculated from the T1 histograms. The age-related tendencies of three quantitative MRI parameters (T1, T2 and secular-T2) and the fractional tissue volumes showed four distinct periods of life, specifically a maturation period (0-2 years), a development period (2-20 years), an adulthood period (20-60 years) and a senescence period (60 years and older). For all ages, the anterior cerebral subsegment exhibited consistently longer gray matter T1s and shorter white matter T1s than the posterior cerebral and cerebellar subsegments. Volumetric age-related changes of the cerebellar subsegment were more gradual than in the cerebral subsegments. This study shows that relaxometric and volumetric age-related changes are synchronized and define the same four periods of brain evolution both globally and regionally. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

C;New imaging technique using Degree Of Polarization for the study of polarimetric properties for non-invasive biomedical diagnostic;This research proposes a new imaging technique for near real time multispectral acquisition using CCD RGB cameras of the so called Degree Of Polarization (DOP) in polarimetry for future clinical investigation. The aim of exploiting the DOP as the contrast element is to demonstrate that the elliptical DOP provides more information characterizing complex medium than the more traditional linear and circular ones. The system considers an incoherent input white light beam and opportunely calibrated nematic crystals (LCVR), so no mechanical tools are necessary. The particular features of the system indicate it to be the perfect candidate for a new imaging system considering in-vivo (as well as ex-vivo) non invasive superficial diagnostic for medical application as dermatologic diagnostics, since no type of sample preparation is necessary, i.e. tissue biopsy, radiation or contrast agent injection. Thus the biomedical application of this method suggests a simple, direct, fast and also easily exploitable future employment, as a desirable mean for clinical investigation but also for digital recognition in biometrics. Further new elements to improve the model of light scattering and matter-light interaction will be acquired, in particular considering a very complete characterization of the system response using latex microspheres suspension to simulate turbid media with different concentration.;2012;10.1117/12.922676
J;Automated image analysis of digital colposcopy for the detection of cervical neoplasia;Digital colposcopy is a promising technology for the detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Automated analysis of colposcopic images could provide an inexpensive alternative to existing screening tools. Our goal is to develop a diagnostic tool that can automatically identify neoplastic tissue from digital images. A multispectral digital colposcope (MDC) is used to acquire reflectance images of the cervix with white light before and after acetic-acid application in 29 patients. A diagnostic image analysis tool is developed to identify neoplasia in the digital images. The digital image analysis is performed in two steps. First, similar optical patterns are clustered together. Second, classification algorithms are used to determine the probability that these regions contain neoplastic tissue. The classification results of each patient's images are assessed relative to the gold standard of histopathology. Acetic acid induces changes in the intensity of reflected light as well as the ratio of green to red reflected light. These changes are used to differentiate high-grade squamous intraepithelial (HGSIL) and cancerous lesions from normal or low-grade squamous intraepithelial (LGSIL) tissue. We report diagnostic performance with a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 88%. We show that diagnostically useful digital images of the cervix can be obtained using a simple and inexpensive device, and that automated image analysis algorithms show a potential to identify histologically neoplastic tissue areas.

J;Hyperspectral data influenced by sample matrix: the importance of building relevant reference spectral libraries to map materials of interest;"Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and mapping are increasingly used for visualization and identification of nanoparticles (NPs) in a variety of matrices, including aqueous suspensions and biological samples. Reference spectral libraries (RSLs) contain hyperspectral data collected from materials of known composition and are used to detect the known materials in experimental samples through a one-to-one pixel mapping process. In some HSI studies, RSLs created from raw NPs were used to map NPs in experimental samples in a different matrix; for example, RSLs created from NPs in suspension to map NPs in biological tissue. Others have utilized RSLs created from NPs in the same matrix. However, few studies have systematically compared hyperspectral data as a function of the matrix in which the NPs are found and its impact on mapping results. The objective of this study is to compare RSLs created from metal oxide NPs in aqueous suspensions to RSLs created from the same NPs in rat tissues following in vivo inhalation exposure, and to investigate the differences in mapping that result from the use of each RSL. Results demonstrate that the spectral profiles of these NPs are matrix dependent: RSLs created from NPs in positive control tissues mapped to experimental tissues more appropriately than RSLs created from NPs in suspension. Aqueous suspension RSLs mapped 0-602 out of 500,424 pixels per tissue image while tissue RSLs mapped 689-18,435 pixels for the same images. This study underscores the need for appropriate positive controls for the creation of RSLs for mapping NPs in experimental samples.";2017;10.1002/jemt.22816
J;Use of tissue water as a concentration reference for proton spectroscopic imaging;"A strategy for using tissue water as a concentration standard in H-1 magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging studies on the brain is presented, and the potential errors that may arise when the method is used are examined. The sensitivity of the method to errors in estimates of the different water compartment relaxation times is shown to be small at short echo times (TEs). Using data from healthy human subjects, it is shown that different image segmentation approaches that are commonly used to account for partial volume effects (SIPM2, FSL's FAST, and K-means) lead to different estimates of metabolite levels, particularly in gray matter (GM), owing primarily to variability in the estimates of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fraction. While consistency does not necessarily validate a method, a multi-spectral segmentation approach using FAST yielded the lowest intersubject variability in the estimates of GM metabolites. The mean GM and white matter (WM) levels of N-acetyl groups (NAc, primarily N-acetylaspartate), choline (Ch), and creatine (Cr) obtained in these subjects using the described method with FAST multispectral segmentation are reported: GM [NAc] = 17.16 +/- 1.19 mM; WM [NAc] = 14.26 +/- 1.38 mM; GM [Ch] = 3.27 +/- 0.47 mM; WM [Ch] = 2.65 +/- 0.25 mM; GM [Cr] = 13.98 +/- 1.20 mM; and WM [Cr] = 7.10 +/- 0.67 mM.";2006;10.1002/mrm.20901
J;Review of spectral imaging technology in biomedical engineering: achievements and challenges;Spectral imaging is a technology that integrates conventional imaging and spectroscopy to get both spatial and spectral information from an object.

C;Preclinical and clinical validation of a novel oxygenation imaging system;Introduction: Two major disadvantages of currently available oxygenation probes are the need for contact with the skin and long measurement stabilization times. A novel oxygenation imaging device based on spatial frequency domain and spectral principles has been designed, validated preclinically on pigs, and validated clinically on humans. Importantly, this imaging system has been designed to operate under the rigorous conditions of an operating room. Materials and Methods: Optical properties reconstruction and wavelength selection have been optimized to allow fast and reliable oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin imaging under realistic conditions. In vivo preclinical validation against commercially available contact oxygenation probes was performed on pigs undergoing arterial and venous occlusions. Finally, the device was used clinically to image skin flap oxygenation during a pilot study on women undergoing breast reconstruction after mastectomy. Results: A novel illumination head containing a spatial light modulator (SLM) and a novel fiber-coupled high power light source were constructed. Preclinical experiments showed similar values between local probes and the oxygenation imaging system, with measurement times of the new system being < 500 msec. During pilot clinical studies, the imaging system was able to provide near real-time oxyHb, deoxyHb, and saturation measurements over large fields of view (> 300 cm(2)). Conclusion: A novel optical-based oxygenation imaging system has the potential to replace contact probes during human surgery and to provide quantitative, wide-field measurements in near real-time.;2011;10.1117/12.875603

J;Surgical Vision;The emergence of Minimal Access Surgery (MAS) as a paradigm in modern healthcare treatment has created new challenges and opportunities for automated image understanding and computer vision. In MAS, images recovered from inside the body using specialized devices are used to visualize and operate on the surgical site but they can also be used to computationally infer in vivo 3D tissue surface shape, soft-tissue morphology, and surgical instrument motion. This information is important for facilitating in vivo biophotonic imaging modalities where the interaction between light and tissue is used to infer the structural and functional properties of the tissue. This article provides a review of the literature for computer vision and image understanding techniques applied to MAS images. The focus of this article is to elucidate a perspective on how computer vision techniques can be used to support and enhance the capabilities of biophotonic imaging modalities during surgery. Note that while MAS encompasses a variety of surgical specializations this review does not involve procedures performed in the interventional suite. The review has been carried out based on searches in the PubMed and IEEE databases using the article's keywords.;2012;10.1007/s10439-011-0441-z
J;Diffuse near-infrared imaging of tissue with picosecond time resolution;Optical imaging of biological tissue in vivo at multiple wavelengths in the near-infrared (NIR) spectral range can be achieved with picosecond time resolution at high sensitivity by time-correlated single photon counting. Measuring and analyzing the distribution of times of flight of photons randomly propagated through the tissue has been applied for diffuse optical imaging and spectroscopy, e.g. of human breast tissue and of the brain. In this article, we review the main features and the potential of NIR multispectral imaging with picosecond time resolution and illustrate them by exemplar applications in these fields. In particular, we discuss the experimental methods developed at the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) to record optical mammograms and to quantify the absorption and scattering properties from which hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation of healthy and diseased breast tissue have been derived by combining picosecond time-domain and spectral information. Furthermore, optical images of functional brain activation were obtained by a non-contact scanning device exploiting the null source-detector separation approach which takes advantage of the picosecond time resolution as well. The recorded time traces of changes in the oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin concentrations during a motor stimulation investigation show a localized response from the brain.;2018;10.1515/bmt-2017-0067
J;Hyperspectral in vivo two-photon microscopy of intrinsic contrast;In vivo two-photon imaging of intrinsic contrast can provide valuable information about structural tissue elements such as collagen and elastin and fluorescent metabolites such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Yet low signal and overlapping emission spectra can make it difficult to identify and delineate these species in vivo. We present a novel approach that combines excitation scanning with spectrally resolved emission two-photon microscopy, allowing distinct structures to be delineated based on their characteristic spectral fingerprints. The amounts of intrinsic fluorophores present in each voxel can also be evaluated. We demonstrate our method using in vivo imaging of nude mouse skin.

J;Computational macroscopic lifetime imaging and concentration unmixing of autofluorescence;Single-pixel computational imaging can leverage highly sensitive detectors that concurrently acquire data across spectral and temporal domains. For molecular imaging, such methodology enables to collect rich intensity and lifetime multiplexed fluorescence datasets. Herein we report on the application of a single-pixel structured light-based platform for macroscopic imaging of tissue autofluorescence. The super-continuum visible excitation and hyperspectral single-pixel detection allow for parallel characterization of autofluorescence intensity and lifetime. Furthermore, we exploit a deep learning based data processing pipeline, to perform autofluorescence unmixing while yielding the autofluorophores' concentrations. The full scheme (setup and processing) is validated in silico and in vitro with clinically relevant autofluorophores flavin adenine dinucleotide, riboflavin, and protoporphyrin. The presented results demonstrate the potential of the methodology for macroscopically quantifying the intensity and lifetime of autofluorophores, with higher specificity for cases of mixed emissions, which are ubiquitous in autofluorescence and multiplexed in vivo imaging.;2022;10.1002/jbio.202200133
C;Optimization of the incident wavelength for Mueller matrix imaging of cervical collagen;Mueller matrix polarimetry (MMP) can be utilized to determine optical anisotropy in birefringent materials. Many factors must be optimized to improve the quality of information collected from MMP of biological samples. As part of a study on pre-term birth (PTB) that relied on measurement of the orientation and distribution of collagen in the cervix, an optimal wavelength for MMP to allow more accurate characterization of collagen in cervical tissue was sought. To this end, we developed a multispectral Mueller matrix polarimeter and conducted experiments on ex-vivo porcine cervix samples preserved in paraffin. The Mueller matrices obtained with this system were decomposed to generate orientation and retardation images. Initial findings indicate that wavelengths below 560 nm offer a more accurate characterization of collagen anisotropy in the porcine cervix.;2018;10.1117/12.2290766
J;Improved detection of metastases on magnetic resonance images by digital tissue recognition: Validation using VX-2 tumor in the rabbit;Purpose: To evaluate the ability of a prototype digital tissue recognition (DTR) system to improve the accuracy of detection of metastases on magnetic resonance (MR) images in the rabbit VX-2 tumor model. Materials and Methods: Multiple MR imaging (MRI) sequences, including pre-contrast and post-contrast enhanced T1-weighted, T2-weighted, proton-density, and fast short inversion time inversion recovery (FSTIR), were acquired for six rabbits implanted with VX-2 adenocarcinoma. For each rabbit, DTR used the MR intensity characteristics of a known tumor site to highlight other areas suspicious for tumor. Three independent veterinary radiologists with extensive experience in animal MRI interpreted the images for tumor both without and with the results of DTR. The conventional and DTR-assisted interpretations were compared to pathology. Results: Using DTR, the radiologists found an average of 13.2% more true positive sites with a 10.3% reduction in false positives compared to unassisted interpretation. The improvement for the radiologists was statistically significant (McNemar's test, P = 0.0004). The agreement between radiologists using DTR was consistently higher than for their conventional interpretations (kappa statistic). Conclusion: Compared with conventional interpretation of MR images, the use of DTR provided a statistically significant improvement in the accuracy of locating more and smaller sites of tumor. This improvement was achieved without the benefit of post-contrast images.;2003;10.1002/jmri.10342
C;Advancing biological imaging with multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT);Multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is an imaging method that can resolve fluorochromes and other reporter molecules with high sensitivity and specificity deep inside live animals and tissues. The method can penetrate for several millimeters to centimeters in tissues and offers resolutions in the 30 - 100 micron range. We discuss advances with technical implementation and in-vivo imaging applications ranging from mesoscopic imaging of drosophila and adult zebrafish to imaging various cellular functions in mice. MSOT comes with significant potential to shift the paradigm of biological imaging and become a method of choice in basic and drug discovery and in several clinical applications.;2009;10.1109/ISBI.2009.5193276
J;Multiparametric Photoacoustic Analysis of Human Thyroid Cancers In Vivo;Thyroid cancer is one of the most common cancers, with a global increase in incidence rate for both genders. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration is the current gold standard to diagnose thyroid cancers, but the results are inaccurate, leading to repeated biopsies and unnecessary surgeries. To reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies, we explored the use of multiparametric photoacoustic (PA) analysis in combination with the American Thyroid Association (ATA) Guideline (ATAP). In this study, we performed in vivo multispectral PA imaging on thyroid nodules from 52 patients, comprising 23 papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and 29 benign cases. From the multispectral PA data, we calculated hemoglobin oxygen saturation level in the nodule area, then classified the PTC and benign nodules with multiparametric analysis. Statistical analyses showed that this multiparametric analysis of multispectral PA responses could classify PTC nodules. Combining the photoacoustically indicated probability of PTC and the ATAP led to a new scoring method that achieved a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 93%. This study is the first multiparametric analysis of multispectral PA data of thyroid nodules with statistical significance. As a proof of concept, the results show that the proposed new ATAP scoring can help physicians examine thyroid nodules for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, thus reducing unnecessary biopsies. Significance: This report highlights a novel photoacoustic scoring method for risk stratification of thyroid nodules, where malignancy of the nodules can be diagnosed with 83% sensitivity and 93% specificity.;2021;10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-20-3334
J;Hyperspectral Coherent Raman Scattering and Its Applications;There is abundant material information in biological samples, and each material has its unique properties and functions. Research on the production, transportation, and distribution of these materials in organisms can give us a deep understanding of biological systems. Optical microscopes with chemical specificity are powerful and reliable tools for these studies. Raman scattering technology has greatly promoted the development of biomedicine because it solves the problems caused by the fluorescence microscope. Especially, hyperspectral coherent Raman scattering (HS-CRS) microscope can perform label-free chemical imaging of substances with different components. By providing image and spectral information at the same time, the properties, content and distribution of substances in the sample can be determined. It provides scientific researchers with more dimensional material information. In recent decades, HS-CRS has been continuously updated and applied in the biomedical field. This paper introduces the main HS-CRS implementation and schemes and summarizes its application in the biomedical field.;2022;10.3788/LOP202259.0617003
J;Dark-fieldhyperspectral imaging for label free detection ofnano-bio-materials;Nanomaterials are playing an increasingly important role in cancer diagnosis and treatment. Nanoparticle (NP)-based technologies have been utilized for targeted drug delivery during chemotherapies, photodynamic therapy, and immunotherapy. Another active area of research is the toxicity studies of these nanomaterials to understand the cellular uptake and transport of these materials in cells, tissues, and environment. Traditional techniques such as transmission electron microscopy, and mass spectrometry to analyze NP-based cellular transport or toxicity effect are expensive, require extensive sample preparation, and are low-throughput. Dark-field hyperspectral imaging (DF-HSI), an integration of spectroscopy and microscopy/imaging, provides the ability to investigate cellular transport of these NPs and to quantify the distribution of them within bio-materials. DF-HSI also offers versatility in non-invasively monitoring microorganisms, single cell, and proteins. DF-HSI is a low-cost, label-free technique that is minimally invasive and is a viable choice for obtaining high-throughput quantitative molecular analyses. Multimodal imaging modalities such as Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy are also being integrated with HSI systems to enable chemical imaging of the samples. HSI technology is being applied in surgeries to obtain molecular information about the tissues in real-time. This article provides brief overview of fundamental principles of DF-HSI and its application for nanomaterials, protein-detection, single-cell analysis, microbiology, surgical procedures along with technical challenges and future integrative approach with other imaging and measurement modalities.

J;Optimal Spectral Combination of a Hyperspectral Camera for Intraoperative Hemodynamic and Metabolic Brain Mapping;Intraoperative optical imaging is a localization technique for the functional areas of the human brain cortex during neurosurgical procedures. These areas are assessed by monitoring the oxygenated (HbO(2)) and deoxygenated hemoglobin (Hb) concentration changes occurring in the brain. Sometimes, the functional status of the brain is assessed using metabolic biomarkers: the oxidative state of cytochrome-c-oxidase (oxCCO). A setup composed of a white light source and a hyperspectral or a standard RGB camera could be used to identify the functional areas. The choice of the best spectral configuration is still based on an empirical approach. We propose in this study a method to define the optimal spectral combinations of a commercial hyperspectral camera for the computation of hemodynamic and metabolic brain maps. The method is based on a Monte Carlo framework that simulates the acquisition of the intrinsic optical signal following a neuronal activation. The results indicate that the optimal spectral combination of a hyperspectral camera aims to accurately quantify the HbO(2)(0.5%error), Hb (4.4%error), and oxCCO (15%error) responses in the brain following neuronal activation. We also show that RGB imaging is a low cost and accurate solution to compute Hb maps (4%error), but not accurate to compute HbO(2)(48%error) or oxCCO (1036%error) maps.;2020;10.3390/app10155158
J;Combined magnetic resonance and bioluminescence imaging of live mice;We perform combined magnetic resonance and bioluminescence imaging of live mice for the purpose of improving the accuracy of bioluminescence tomography. The imaging is performed on three live nude mice in which tritium-powered light sources are surgically implanted. High-resolution magnetic resonance images and multispectral, multiview bioluminescence images are acquired in the same session. An anatomical model is constructed by segmenting the magnetic resonance images for all major tissues. The model is subsequently registered with nonlinear transformations to the 3-D light exittance (exiting intensity) surface map generated from the luminescence images. A Monte Carlo algorithm, along with a set of tissue optical properties obtained from in vivo measurements, is used to solve the forward problem. The measured and simulated light exittance images are found to differ by a factor of up to 2. The greatest cause of this moderate discrepancy is traced to the small errors in source positioning, and to a lesser extent to the optical properties used for the tissues. Discarding the anatomy and using a homogeneous model leads to a marginally worse agreement between the simulated and measured data.

J;Advanced multispectral image-processing endoscopy system for visualizing two-dimensional hemoglobin saturation and relative hemoglobin concentration;Background and study aims The association of tumor hypoxia and vascularization with malignant progression is recognized, and detection by measuring tissue hemoglobin (Hb) saturation and concentration has attracted attention. In this study, we designed a simple algorithm and multispectral image-processing endoscopy system to map relative Hb concentration and Hb saturation for detection of tumors in small animal viscera in vivo. Materials and methods We designed and validated an optical filter-equipped endoscope system for two-dimensional visualization of Hb concentration and saturation maps and used it in a real-time video examination. A simplified method based on spectral data capture and analysis of defuse reflection of mucosa, including image capture and data processing of the spectral features of Hb oxygenation, was developed. Results An Hb saturation calibration curve was obtained. Then, differences in oxygenation levels between normal mucosa and in vivo tumors in a small animal model were determined by using the new method and endoscope system. Conclusions A multispectral image-processing endoscopic system with a mapping frame rate comparable to that of white light imaging systems (7.5 frames/second) was developed.;2019;10.1055/a-0990-9189
J;Hyperspectral coherent Raman imaging - principle, theory, instrumentation, and applications to life sciences;Coherent Raman scattering microscopy such as coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering and stimulated Raman scattering microscopy boosts the weak Raman signal and enables us to perform label-free visualization of the molecular distribution and its dynamical behavior in living cells and tissues with high speed. In comparison with fluorescence imaging, cells and tissues can be visualized without specifying the target molecule. In this review, we describe the characteristics of a hyperspectral coherent Raman imaging method, which is capable of acquiring both spectra and images simultaneously, and review applications to life sciences.

J;Estimating relative chromophore concentrations from multiwavelength photoacoustic images using independent component analysis;Independent component analysis (ICA) is an unmixing method based on a linear model. It has previously been applied in in vivo multiwavelength photoacoustic imaging studies to unmix the components representing individual chromophores by assuming that they are statistically independent. Numerically simulated and experimentally acquired two-dimensional images of tissue-mimicking phantoms are used to investigate the conditions required for ICA to give accurate estimates of the relative chromophore concentrations. A simple approximate fluence correction was applied to reduce but not completely remove the nonlinear fluence distortion, as might be possible in practice. The results show that ICA is robust against the residual effect of the partially corrected fluence distortion. ICA is shown to provide accurate unmixing of the chromophores when the absorption coefficient is within a certain range of values, where the upper absorption threshold is comparable to the absorption of blood. When the absorption is increased beyond these thresholds, ICA abruptly fails to unmix the chromophores accurately. The ICA approach was compared to a linear spectroscopic inversion (SI) with known absorption spectra. In cases where the mixing matrix with the specific absorption spectra is ill-conditioned, ICA is able to provide accurate unmixing when SI results in large errors. (C) The Authors.

J;Volumetric chemical imaging by clearing-enhanced stimulated Raman scattering microscopy;Three-dimensional visualization of tissue structures using optical microscopy facilitates the understanding of biological functions. However, optical microscopy is limited in tissue penetration due to severe light scattering. Recently, a series of tissue-clearing techniques have emerged to allow significant depth-extension for fluorescence imaging. Inspired by these advances, we develop a volumetric chemical imaging technique that couples Raman-tailored tissue-clearing with stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy. Compared with the standard SRS, the clearing-enhanced SRS achieves greater than 10-times depth increase. Based on the extracted spatial distribution of proteins and lipids, our method reveals intricate 3D organizations of tumor spheroids, mouse brain tissues, and tumor xenografts. We further develop volumetric phasor analysis of multispectral SRS images for chemically specific clustering and segmentation in 3D. Moreover, going beyond the conventional label-free paradigm, we demonstrate metabolic volumetric chemical imaging, which allows us to simultaneously map out metabolic activities of protein and lipid synthesis in glioblastoma. Together, these results support volumetric chemical imaging as a valuable tool for elucidating comprehensive 3D structures, compositions, and functions in diverse biological contexts, complementing the prevailing volumetric fluorescence microscopy.;2019;10.1073/pnas.1813044116
J;High-speed molecular spectral imaging of tissue with stimulated Raman scattering;To date, medical imaging of tissues has largely relied on time-consuming staining processes, and there is a need for rapid, label-free imaging techniques. Stimulated Raman scattering microscopy offers a three-dimensional, real-time imaging capability with chemical specificity. However, it can be difficult to differentiate between several constituents in tissues because their spectral characteristics can overlap. Furthermore, imaging speeds in previous multispectral stimulated Raman scattering imaging techniques were limited. Here, we demonstrate label-free imaging of tissues by 30 frames/s stimulated Raman scattering microscopy with frame-by-frame wavelength tunability. To produce multicolour images showing different constituents, spectral images were processed by modified independent component analysis, which can extract small differences in spectral features. We present various imaging modalities such as two-dimensional spectral imaging of rat liver, two-colour three-dimensional imaging of a vessel in rat liver, spectral imaging of several sections of intestinal villi in mouse, and in vivo spectral imaging of mouse ear skin.;2012;10.1038/NPHOTON.2012.263
J;Noninvasive Measurement of Oxygen Saturation in Human Retinal Blood Vessels and Tissues With Multispectral Confocal Imaging;BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Proof of concept for the first system of noninvasive human retinal vessel and tissue oxygenation measurement in axial and radial directions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A confocal imaging system capable of calculating and mapping relative retinal blood oxygenation in radial and axial directions from three eyes of two healthy subjects was built. The relationship between oxygenation and retinal depth in vivo was analyzed to illustrate application of this novel system. RESULTS: The system shows capacity for measuring oxygenation along retinal depth for the first time. (1) Arteriovenous oxygenation difference decreases with blood vessel diameter. (2) Artery-tissue oxygenation difference is greater than vein-tissue oxygenation difference in the same region. (3) Intravascular-extravascular oxygenation difference decreases with blood vessel diameter. (4) Oxygenation data reported with a 95% CI are as follows: A1 91.5% +/- 18.2%, V1 32.8% +/- 18.6%, A2 97.3% +/- 17.8%, V2 64.4% +/- 11.2%, A3 73.2% +/- 19.1%, V3 52.9% +/- 15.3%, and Tissue 56.6% +/- 00.4%. CONCLUSION: This article demonstrates proof of concept for retinal oxygenation calculation in radial and axial dimensions for the first time. Initial results provide biological validity to this method. Future aims include further characterization of this system's results in healthy subjects and subsequent comparison of oxygenation between diseased and healthy retinae.;2022;10.3928/23258160-20220420-01
J;Hyperspectral imaging of human skin aided by artificial neural networks;We developed a compact, hand-held hyperspectral imaging system for 2D neural network-based visualization of skin chromophores and blood oxygenation. State-of-the-art micro-optic multichannel matrix sensor combined with the tunable Fabry-Perot micro interferometer enables a portable diagnostic device sensitive to the changes of the oxygen saturation as well as the variations of blood volume fraction of human skin. Generalized object-oriented Monte Carlo model is used extensively for the training of an artificial neural network utilized for the hyperspectral image processing. In addition, the results are verified and validated via actual experiments with tissue phantoms and human skin in vivo. The proposed approach enables a tool combining both the speed of an artificial neural network processing and the accuracy and flexibility of advanced Monte Carlo modeling. Finally, the results of the feasibility studies and the experimental tests on biotissue phantoms and healthy volunteers are presented.

J;Frontiers in bronchoscopic imaging;Bronchoscopy is a minimally invasive method for diagnosis of diseases of the airways and the lung parenchyma. Standard bronchoscopy uses the reflectance/scattering properties of white light from tissue to examine the macroscopic appearance of airways. It does not exploit the full spectrum of the optical properties of bronchial tissues. Advances in optical imaging such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), confocal endomicroscopy, autofluorescence imaging and laser Raman spectroscopy are at the forefront to allow in vivo high-resolution probing of the microscopic structure, biochemical compositions and even molecular alterations in disease states. OCT can visualize cellular and extracellular structures at and below the tissue surface with near histological resolution, as well as to provide three-dimensional imaging of the airways. Cellular and subcellular imaging can be achieved using confocal endomicroscopy or endocytoscopy. Contrast associated with light absorption by haemoglobin can be used to highlight changes in microvascular structures in the subepithelium using narrow-band imaging. Blood vessels in the peribronchial space can be displayed using Doppler OCT. Biochemical compositions can be analysed with laser Raman spectroscopy, autofluorescence or multispectral imaging. Clinically, autofluorescence and narrow-band imaging have been found to be useful for localization of preneoplastic and neoplastic bronchial lesions. OCT can differentiate carcinoma in situ versus microinvasive cancer. Endoscopic optical imaging is a promising technology that can expand the horizon for studying the pathogenesis and progression of airway diseases such as COPD and asthma, as well as to evaluate the effect of novel therapy.;2012;10.1111/j.1440-1843.2011.02108.x
J;Optoacoustic Imaging and Tomography: Reconstruction Approaches and Outstanding Challenges in Image Performance and Quantification;This paper comprehensively reviews the emerging topic of optoacoustic imaging from the image reconstruction and quantification perspective. Optoacoustic imaging combines highly attractive features, including rich contrast and high versatility in sensing diverse biological targets, excellent spatial resolution not compromised by light scattering, and relatively low cost of implementation. Yet, living objects present a complex target for optoacoustic imaging due to the presence of a highly heterogeneous tissue background in the form of strong spatial variations of scattering and absorption. Extracting quantified information on the actual distribution of tissue chromophores and other biomarkers constitutes therefore a challenging problem. Image quantification is further compromised by some frequently-used approximated inversion formulae. In this review, the currently available optoacoustic image reconstruction and quantification approaches are assessed, including back-projection and model-based inversion algorithms, sparse signal representation, wavelet-based approaches, methods for reduction of acoustic artifacts as well as multi-spectral methods for visualization of tissue bio-markers. Applicability of the different methodologies is further analyzed in the context of real-life performance in small animal and clinical in-vivo imaging scenarios.;2013;10.3390/s130607345
C;Multidimensional two-photon imaging and spectroscopy of fresh human bladder biopsies;Two-photon microscopy has been successfully used to image several types of tissues, including skin, muscles, tendons. Nevertheless, its usefulness in imaging bladder tissue has not been investigated yet. In this work we used combined twophoton excited fluorescence, second-harmonic generation microscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, and multispectral two-photon emission detection to investigate different kinds of human ex-vivo fresh biopsies of bladder. Morphological and spectroscopic analyses allowed to characterize both healthy mucosa and carcinoma in-situ samples in a good agreement with common routine histology. Cancer cells showed different morphology with respect to the corresponding healthy cells: they appeared more elongated and with a larger nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. From the spectroscopic point of view, differences between the two tissue types in both spectral emission and fluorescence lifetime distribution were found. Even if further analysis, as well as a more significant statistics on a larger number of samples would be helpful to discriminate between low, mild, and high grade cancer, our method is a promising tool to be used as diagnostic confirmation of histological results, as well to be implemented in a multi-photon endoscope or in a spectroscopic for in in-vivo imaging applications.;2010;10.1117/12.841694
J;Enhancing Surgical Vision by Using Real-Time Imaging of alpha(v)beta(3)-Integrin Targeted Near-Infrared Fluorescent Agent;This study was designed to improve the surgical procedure and outcome of cancer surgery by means of real-time molecular imaging feedback of tumor spread and margin delineation using targeted near-infrared fluorescent probes with specificity to tumor biomarkers. Surgical excision of cancer often is confronted with difficulties in the identification of cancer spread and the accurate delineation of tumor margins. Currently, the assessment of tumor borders is afforded by postoperative pathology or, less reliably, intraoperative frozen sectioning. Fluorescence imaging is a natural modality for intraoperative use by directly relating to the surgeon's vision and offers highly attractive characteristics, such as high-resolution, sensitivity, and portability. Via the use of targeted probes it also becomes highly tumor-specific and can lead to significant improvements in surgical procedures and outcome. Mice bearing xenograft human tumors were injected with alpha(v)beta(3)-integrin receptor-targeted fluorescent probe and in vivo visualized by using a novel, real-time, multispectral fluorescence imaging system. Confirmatory ex vivo imaging, bioluminescence imaging, and histopathology were used to validate the in vivo findings. Fluorescence images were all in good correspondence with the confirming bioluminescence images in respect to signal colocalization. Fluorescence imaging detected all tumors and successfully guided total tumor excision by effectively detecting small tumor residuals, which occasionally were missed by the surgeon. Tumor tissue exhibited target-to-background ratio of similar to 4.0, which was significantly higher compared with white-light images representing the visual contrast. Histopathology confirmed the capability of the method to identify tumor negative margins with high specificity and better prediction rate compared with visual inspection. Real-time multispectral fluorescence imaging using tumor specific molecular probes is a promising modality for tumor excision by offering real time feedback to the surgeon in the operating room.;2011;10.1245/s10434-011-1664-9
J;Multispectral breast imaging using a ten-wavelength, 64X64 source/detector channels silicon photodiode-based diffuse optical tomography system;We describe a compact diffuse optical tomography system specifically designed for breast imaging. The system consists of 64 silicon photodiode detectors, 64 excitation points, and 10 diode lasers in the near-infrared region, allowing multispectral, three-dimensional optical imaging of breast tissue. We also detail the system performance and optimization through a calibration procedure. The system is evaluated using tissue-like phantom experiments and an in vivo clinic experiment. Quantitative two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) images of absorption and reduced scattering coefficients are obtained from these experiments. The ten-wavelength spectra of the extracted reduced scattering coefficient enable quantitative morphological images to be reconstructed with this system. From the in vivo clinic experiment, functional images including deoxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, and water concentration are recovered and tumors are detected with correct size and position compared with the mammography.

J;Remote non-invasive stereoscopic imaging of blood vessels: First in-vivo results of a new multispectral contrast enhancement technology;"We describe a contactless optical technique selectively enhancing superficial blood vessels below variously pigmented intact human skin by combining images in different spectral bands. Two CMOS-cameras, with apochromatic lenses and dual-band LED-arrays, simultaneously streamed Left (L) and Right (R) image data to a dualprocessor PC. Both cameras captured color images within the visible range (VIS, 400-780 nm) and grey-scale images within the near infrared range (NIR, 910-920 nm) by sequentially switching between LED-array emission bands. Image-size-settings of 1280 x 1024 for VIS & 640 x 512 for NIR produced 12 cycles/s (1 cycle = 1 VIS L&R-pair + I NIR L&R-pair). Decreasing image-size-settings (640 x 512 for VIS and 320 x 256 for NIR) increased camera-speed to 25 cycles/s. Contrasts from below the tissue surface were algorithmically distinguished from surface shadows, reflections, etc. Thus blood vessels were selectively enhanced and back-projected into the stereoscopic VIS-color-image using either a 3D-display or conventional shutter glasses. As a first usability reconnaissance we applied this custom-built mobile stereoscopic camera for several clinical settings: blood withdrawal; vein inspection in dark skin; vein detection through iodide: varicose vein and nevi pigmentosum inspection. Our technique improves blood vessel visualization compared to the naked eye, and supports depth perception.";2006;10.1007/s10439-006-9198-1
J;Targeting Apoptosis for Optical Imaging of Infection;Infection is ubiquitous and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The most reliable method for localizing infection requires radiolabeling autologous white blood cells ex vivo. A compound that can be injected directly into a patient and can selectively image infectious foci will eliminate the drawbacks. The resolution of infection is associated with neutrophil apoptosis and necrosis presenting phosphatidylserine (PS) on the neutrophil outer leaflet. Targeting PS with intravenous administration of a PS-specific, near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore will permit localization of infectious foci by optical imaging. Bacterial infection and sterile inflammation were induced in separate groups (n = 5) of mice. PS was targeted with a NIR fluorophore, PSVue(A (R))794 (2.7 pmol). Imaging was performed (ex = 730 nm, em = 830 nm) using Kodak Multispectral FX-Pro system. The contralateral normal thigh served as an individualized control. Confocal microscopy of normal and apoptotic neutrophils and bacteria confirmed PS specificity. Lesions, with a 10-s image acquisition, were unequivocally visible at 5 min post-injection. At 3 h post-injection, the lesion to background intensity ratios in the foci of infection (6.6 +/- 0.2) were greater than those in inflammation (3.2 +/- 0.5). Image fusions confirmed anatomical locations of the lesions. Confocal microscopy determined the fluorophore specificity for PS. Targeting PS presented on the outer leaflet of apoptotic or necrotic neutrophils as well as gram-positive microorganism with PS-specific NIR fluorophore provides a sensitive means of imaging infection. Literature indicates that NIR fluorophores can be detected 7-14 cm deep in tissue. This observation together with the excellent results and the continued development of versatile imaging devices could make optical imaging a simple, specific, and rapid modality for imaging infection.;2012;10.1007/s11307-011-0490-6
J;WST11 Vascular Targeted Photodynamic Therapy Effect Monitoring by Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) in Mice;Objective: Monitoring emerging vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (VTP) and understanding the time-dynamics of treatment effects remains challenging. We interrogated whether handheld multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) could noninvasively monitor the effect of VTP using WST11, a vascular-acting photosensitizer, on tumor tissues over time using a renal cell cancer mouse model. We also investigated whether MSOT illumination can induce VTP, to implement a single-modality theranostic approach. Materials and Methods: Eight BalB/c mice were subcutaneously implanted with murine renal adenocarcinoma cells (RENCA) on the flank. Three weeks later VTP was performed (10 min continuous illumination at 753 nm following intravenous infusion) using WST11 or saline as control. Handheld MSOT images were collected prior to VTP administration and subsequently thereafter over the course of the first hour, at 24 and 48 h. Data collected were unmixed for blood oxygen saturation in tissue (SO2) based on the spectral signatures of deoxy-and oxygenated hemoglobin. Changes in oxygen saturation over time, relative to baseline, were examined by paired t-test for statistical significance (p < 0.05). In-vivo findings were corroborated by histological analyses of the tumor tissue. Results: MSOT is shown to prominently resolve changes in oxygen saturation in tumors within the first 20 min post WST11-VTP treatment. Within the first hour post-treatment, SO2 decreased by more than 60% over baseline (p < 0.05), whereas it remained unchanged (p > 0.1) in the sham-treated group. Moreover, unlike in the control group, SO2 in treated tumors further decreased over the course of 24 to 48 h post-treatment, concomitant with the propagation of profound central tumor necrosis present in histological analysis. We further show that pulsed MSOT illumination can activate WST11 as efficiently as the continuous wave irradiation employed for treatment. Conclusion: Handheld MSOT non-invasively monitored WST11-VTP effects based on the SO2 signal and detected blood saturation changes within the first 20 min post-treatment. MSOT may potentially serve as a means for both VTP induction and real-time VTP monitoring in a theranostic approach.;2018;10.7150/thno.20386
J;Automated melanoma detection: Multispectral imaging and neural network approach for classification;Our aim in the present research is to investigate the diagnostic performance of artificial neural networks (ANNs) applied to multispectral images of cutaneous pigmented skin lesions as well as to compare this approach to a standard traditional linear classification method, such as discriminant function analysis. This study involves a series of 534 patients with 573 cutaneous pigmented lesions (132 melanomas and 441 nonmelanoma lesions). Each lesion was analyzed by a telespectrophotometric system (TS) in vivo, before surgery. The system is able to acquire a set of 17 images at selected wavelengths from 400 to 1040 nm. For each wavelength, five lesion descriptors were extracted, related to the criteria of the ABCD (for asymmetry, border, color, and dimension) clinical guide for melanoma diagnosis. These variables were first reduced in dimension by the use of factor analysis techniques and then used as input data in an ANN. Multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA) was also performed on the same dataset. The whole dataset was split into two independent groups: i.e., train (the first 400 cases, 95 melanomas) and verification set (last 173 cases, 37 melanomas). Factor analysis was able to summarize the data structure into ten variables, accounting for at least 90% of the original parameters variance. After proper training, the ANN was able to classify the population with 80% sensitivity, 72% specificity, and 78% sensitivity, 76% specificity for the train and validation set, respectively. Following ROC analysis, area under curve (AUC) was 0.852 (train) and 0.847 (verify). Sensitivity and specificity values obtained by the standard discriminant analysis classifier resulted in a figure of 80% sensitivity, 60% specificity and 76% sensitivity, 57% specificity for the train and validation set, respectively. AUC for MDA was 0.810 and 0.764 for the train and verify set, respectively. Classification results were significantly different between the two methods both for diagnostic scores and model stability, which was worse for MDA.

J;Towards Quantitative Evaluation of Tissue Absorption Coefficients Using Light Fluence Correction in Optoacoustic Tomography;"Optoacoustic tomography is a fast developing imaging modality, combining the high contrast available from optical excitation of tissue with the high resolution and penetration depth of ultrasound detection. Light is subject to both absorption and scattering when traveling through tissue; adequate knowledge of tissue optical properties and hence the spatial fluence distribution is required to create an optoacoustic image that is directly proportional to chromophore concentrations at all depths. Using data from a commercial multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) system, we implemented an iterative optimization for fluence correction based on a finite-element implementation of the delta-Eddington approximation to the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE). We demonstrate a linear relationship between the image intensity and absorption coefficients across multiple wavelengths and depths in phantoms. We also demonstrate improved feature visibility and spectral recovery at depth in phantoms and with in vivo measurements, suggesting our approach could in the future enable quantitative extraction of tissue absorption coefficients in biological tissue.";2017;10.1109/TMI.2016.2607199
J;Optical imaging of tumor hypoxia dynamics;The influence of the tumor microenvironment and hypoxia plays a significant role in determining cancer progression, treatment response, and treatment resistance. That the tumor microenvironment is highly heterogeneous with significant intratumor and intertumor variability presents a significant challenge in developing effective cancer therapies. Critical to understanding the role of the tumor microenvironment is the ability to dynamically quantify oxygen levels in the vasculature and tissue in order to elucidate the roles of oxygen supply and consumption, spatially and temporally. To this end, we describe the use of hyperspectral imaging to characterize hemoglobin absorption to quantify hemoglobin content and oxygen saturation, as well as dual emissive fluorescent/phosphorescent boron nanoparticles, which serve as ratiometric indicators of tissue oxygen tension. Applying these techniques to a window-chamber tumor model illustrates the role of fluctuations in hemoglobin saturation in driving changes in tissue oxygenation, the two being significantly correlated (r = 0.77). Finally, a green-fluorescence-protein reporter for hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) provides an endpoint for hypoxic stress in the tumor, which is used to demonstrate a significant association between tumor hypoxia dynamics and HIF-1 activity in an in vivo demonstration of the technique.

C;In-vivo validation of fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) of coronary arteries in swine;We report a scanning imaging system that enables high speed multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) of coronary arteries. This system combines a custom low profile (3 Fr) imaging catheter using a 200 mu m core side viewing UV-grade silica fiber optic, an acquisition system able to measure fluorescence decays over four spectral bands at 20 kHz and a fast data analysis and display module. In vivo use of the system has been optimized, with particular emphasis on clearing blood from the optical pathway. A short acquisition time (5 seconds for a 20 mm long coronary segment) enabled data acquisition during a bolus saline solution injection through the 7 Fr catheter guide. The injection parameters were precisely controlled using a power injector and optimized to provide good image quality while limiting the bolus injection duration and volume (12 cc/s, 80 cc total volume). The ability of the system to acquire data in vivo was validated in healthy swine by imaging different sections of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary. A stent coated with fluorescent markers was placed in the LAD and imaged, demonstrating the ability of the system to discriminate in vivo different fluorescent features and structures from the vessel background fluorescence using spectral and lifetime information. Intensity en face images over the four bands of the instrument were available within seconds whereas lifetime images were computed in 2 minutes, providing efficient feedback during the procedure. This successful demonstration of FLIm in coronaries enables future study of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.;2015;10.1117/12.2079833
J;In Vivo Metabolic Fingerprinting of Neutral Lipids with Hyperspectral Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy;Metabolic fingerprinting provides valuable information on the physiopathological states of cells and tissues. Traditional imaging mass spectrometry and magnetic resonance imaging are unable to probe the spatial-temporal dynamics of metabolites at the subcellular level due to either lack of spatial resolution or inability to perform live cell imaging. Here we report a complementary metabolic imaging technique that is based on hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (hsSRS). We demonstrated the use of hsSRS imaging in quantifying two major neutral lipids: cholesteryl ester and triacylglycerol in cells and tissues. Our imaging results revealed previously unknown changes of lipid composition associated with obesity and steatohepatitis. We further used stable-isotope labeling to trace the metabolic dynamics of fatty acids in live cells and live Caenorhabditis elegans with hsSRS imaging. We found that unsaturated fatty acid has preferential uptake into lipid storage while saturated fatty acid exhibits toxicity in hepatic cells. Simultaneous metabolic fingerprinting of deuterium-labeled saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in living C. elegans revealed that there is a lack of interaction between the two, unlike previously hypothesized. Our findings provide new approaches for metabolic tracing of neutral lipids and their precursors in living cells and organisms, and could potentially serve as a general approach for metabolic fingerprinting of other metabolites.;2014;10.1021/ja504199s
C;An Assessment of Photoacoustic and Photon Counting Multispectral x-Ray Imaging Techniques for Imaging Gold Nanorods in vivo as Part of Predicting Dose Enhancing Effects;Radiotherapy, whilst useful in the treatment of many cancers, suffers from the drawback of unavoidably delivering radiation doses to healthy tissue. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been the subject of much interest as they are able to generate a local dose enhancing effect (DEE), allowing lower intensity beams to achieve a given effect, sparing healthy tissue. It is important that GNP distributions can be ascertained before radiotherapy begins so that accurate treatment plans can be made. Two imaging modalities that show great promise in being able to identify these GNPs in vivo without delivering excessive DEEs are photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photon counting multi-spectral x-ray imaging (x-CSI). This work forms part of a larger project to assess the feasibility of using x-CSI and PAI to predict DEEs during radiotherapy planning. This work assessed the degradation of gold nanorods (GNRs) in a photoacoustic system sold by iThera, specifically comparing the protective effects against degradation afforded by a silica coating as opposed to GNR PEGylation. This coating is also hoped to prevent spectral broadening when the GNRs are endocytosed, allowing PAI to confirm uptake of GNRs by cells. With regards x-CSI, this work uses a combination of Monte Carlo and Finite Element modelling techniques to realistically model cylindrical phantoms of high-Z materials in order to demonstrate the potential improvements in imaging contrast that x-CSI can produce over traditional energy integrated x-ray imaging techniques. Results on the assessment of both techniques are discussed.;2016;

C;Hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering imaging of cholesteryl ester accumulation: new avenue to diagnosis of human prostate cancer;Most prostate cancers (PCa) are slowly growing, and only the aggressive ones require early diagnosis and effective treatment. The current standard for PCa diagnosis remains histopathology. Nonetheless, for the differentiation between Gleason score 6 (low-risk PCa), which can be left without treatment, and Gleason score 7 (high-risk PCa), which requires active treatment, the inter-observer discordance can be up to 40%. Our previous study reveals that cholesteryl ester (CE) accumulation induced by PI3K/AKT activation underlies human PCa aggressiveness. However, Raman spectromicroscopy used in this study could only provide compositional information of certain lipid droplets (LDs) selected by the observer, which overlooked cell-to-cell variation and hindered translation to accurate automated diagnosis. Here, we demonstrated quantitative mapping of CE level in human prostate tissues using hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy that renders compositional information for every pixel in the image. Specifically, hundreds of SRS images at Raman shift between 1620-1800 cm-1 were taken, and multivariate curve resolution algorism was used to retrieve concentration images of acyl C=C bond, sterol C=C bond, and ester C=O bond. Given that the ratio between images of sterol C=C and ester C=O (sterol C=C/C=O) is nonlinearly proportional to CE percentage out of total lipid, we were able to quantitatively map CE level. Our data showed that CE level was significantly greater in high Gleason grade compared to low Gleason grade, and could be a factor that significantly contributed to cancer recurrence. Our study provides an opportunity towards more accurate PCa diagnosis and prediction of aggressiveness.;2017;10.1117/12.2246098
J;Use of biomedical photonics in gynecological surgery: a uterine transplantation model;Aim: Uterine transplantation (UTx) has been proposed as a treatment for permanent absolute uterine factor infertility. The study aims were to compare pulse oximetry and multispectral imaging (MSI), for intraoperative tracking of uterine oxygen saturation in animal UTx models (rabbit and sheep). Results/methodology: Imaging results confirmed the re-establishment of adequate perfusion in the transplanted organ after surgery. Comparison of oxygen saturation values between the pre-UTx donor and post-UTx recipient, and pre-UTx and post-UTx recipient reveals a statistically significant decrease in saturation levels post-UTx. Conclusion: The use of MSI is the first case in gynecology and has demonstrated promise of possible future human use. MSI technique has advantages over pulse oximetry - it provides spatial information in a real-time, noncontact manner.;2018;10.4155/fsoa-2017-0129
J;Multispectral oximetry of murine tendon microvasculature with inflammation;We report a novel multispectral imaging technique for localised measurement of vascular oxygen saturation (SO2) in vivo. Annular back-illumination is generated using a Schwarzchild-design reflective objective. Analysis of multispectral data is performed using a calibration-free oximetry algorithm. This technique is applied to oximetry in mice to measure SO2 in microvasculature supplying inflamed tendon tissue in the hind leg. Average SO2 for controls was 94.8 +/- 7.0 % (N= 6), and 84.0 +/- 13.5 % for mice with inflamed tendon tissue (N = 6). We believe this to be the first localised measurement of hypoxia in tendon microvasculature due to inflammation. Quantification of localised SO2 is important for the study of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, where hypoxia is thought to play a role in pathogenesis.

J;Simultaneous Dual-Modal Multispectral Photoacoustic and Ultrasound Macroscopy for Three-Dimensional Whole-Body Imaging of Small Animals;Photoacoustic imaging is a promising medical imaging technique that provides excellent function imaging of an underlying biological tissue or organ. However, it is limited in providing structural information compared to other imaging modalities, such as ultrasound imaging. Thus, to offer complete morphological details of biological tissues, photoacoustic imaging is typically integrated with ultrasound imaging. This dual-modal imaging technique is already implemented on commercial clinical ultrasound imaging platforms. However, commercial platforms suffer from limited elevation resolution compared to the lateral and axial resolution. We have successfully developed a dual-modal photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging to address these limitations, specifically targeting animal studies. The system can acquire whole-body images of mice in vivo and provide complementary structural and functional information of biological tissue information simultaneously. The color-coded depth information can be readily obtained in photoacoustic images using complementary information from ultrasound images. The system can be used for several biomedical applications, including drug delivery, biodistribution assessment, and agent testing.;2021;10.3390/photonics8010013
J;Single-side access, isotropic resolution, and multispectral three-dimensional photoacoustic imaging with rotate-translate scanning of ultrasonic detector array;Photoacoustic imaging can achieve high-resolution three-dimensional (3-D) visualization of optical absorbers at penetration depths of similar to 1 cm in biological tissues by detecting optically induced high ultrasound frequencies. Tomographic acquisition with ultrasound linear arrays offers an easy implementation of single-side access, parallelized, and high-frequency detection, but usually comes with an image quality impaired by the directionality of the detectors. Indeed, a simple translation of the array perpendicular to its median imaging plane is often used, but results both in a poor resolution in the translation direction and strong limited-view artifacts. To improve the spatial resolution and the visibility of complex structures while retaining a planar detection geometry, we introduce, in this paper, a rotate-translate scanning scheme and investigate the performance of a scanner implemented at 15 MHz center frequency. The developed system achieved a quasi-isotropic uniform 3-D resolution of similar to 170 mu m over a cubic volume of side length 8.5 mm, i.e., an improvement in the resolution in the translation direction by almost one order of magnitude. Dual-wavelength imaging was also demonstrated with ultrafast wavelength shifting. The validity of our approach was shown in vitro. We discuss the ability to enable in vivo imaging for preclinical and clinical studies. (C) 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE);2015;10.1117/1.JBO.20.5.056004
J;Imaging technologies for monitoring the safety, efficacy and mechanisms of action of cell-based regenerative medicine therapies in models of kidney disease;The incidence of end stage kidney disease is rising annually and it is now a global public health problem. Current treatment options are dialysis or renal transplantation, which apart from their significant drawbacks in terms of increased morbidity and mortality, are placing an increasing economic burden on society. Cell-based Regenerative Medicine Therapies (RMTs) have shown great promise in rodent models of kidney disease, but clinical translation is hampered due to the lack of adequate safety and efficacy data. Furthermore, the mechanisms whereby the cell-based RMTs ameliorate injury are ill-defined. For instance, it is not always clear if the cells directly replace damaged renal tissue, or whether paracrine effects are more important. Knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of cell therapies is crucial because it could lead to the development of safer and more effective RMTs in the future. To address these questions, novel in vivo imaging strategies are needed to monitor the biodistribution of cell-based RMTs and evaluate their beneficial effects on host tissues and organs, as well as any potential adverse effects. In this review we will discuss how state-of-the-art imaging modalities, including bioluminescence, magnetic resonance, nuclear imaging, ultrasound and an emerging imaging technology called multispectral optoacoustic tomography, can be used in combination with various imaging probes to track the fate and biodistribution of cell-based RMTs in rodent models of kidney disease, and evaluate their effect on renal function.

J;Measurement of the optical properties of fruits and vegetables using spatially resolved hyperspectral diffuse reflectance imaging technique;"This paper reports on the measurement of the optical properties of fresh fruits and vegetables over the visible and short-wave near-infrared region (500-1000 nm) using a spatially resolved steady state diffuse reflectance technique. A hyperspectral imaging system in line scan mode was used to acquire spatially resolved diffuse reflectance images from the samples of apple (three varieties), peach, pear, kiwifruit, plum, Cucumber, zucchini squash, and tomato (at three ripeness stages) over the spectral range of 500-1000 nm. The absorption and reduced scattering coefficients of the samples were determined from the spatially resolved scattering profiles usinginverse algorithms for a diffusion theory model. Spectra of the absorption coefficient were featured by major pigments (chlorophyll, anthocyanin, and carotenoid) and water in the samples, whereas spectra of the reduced scattering coefficient generally decreased with the increase of wavelength. Values of the absorption and reduced scattering coefficients varied greatly among the test samples. Large differences in the absorption spectra were observed for the tomatoes of three ripeness stages (green, pink, and red), and their ripeness was correctly classified using the ratio of the absorption coefficient at 675 nm (for chlorophyll) to that at 535 nm (for anthocyanin). Values of the reduced scattering coefficient positively correlated with the firmness of tomatoes at individual wavelengths of 500-1000 nm, with the maximum correlation of 0.66 being obtained at 790 nm. Light penetration depths, defined as the depths at which the incident light was reduced by 99%, were estimated to be between 0.97 and 6.52 cm for the fruit and vegetable samples over the wavelength range of 500-1000 nm; they were influenced by major pigments in the plant tissue. The spatially resolved steady-state diffuse reflectance technique provides a convenient and efficient means for measuring the optical properties of turbid food and agricultural products.

J;Listening to tissues with new light: recent technological advances in photoacoustic imaging;Photoacoustic tomography (PAT), or optoacoustic tomography, has achieved remarkable progress in the past decade, benefiting from the joint developments in optics, acoustics, chemistry, computing and mathematics. Unlike pure optical or ultrasound imaging, PAT can provide unique optical absorption contrast as well as widely scalable spatial resolution, penetration depth and imaging speed. Moreover, PAT has inherent sensitivity to tissue's functional, molecular, and metabolic state. With these merits, PAT has been applied in a wide range of life science disciplines, and has enabled biomedical research unattainable by other imaging methods. This review article aims at introducing state-of-the-art PAT technologies and their representative applications. The focus is on recent technological breakthroughs in structural, functional, molecular PAT, including super-resolution imaging, real-time small-animal whole-body imaging, and high-sensitivity functional/molecular imaging. We also discuss the remaining challenges in PAT and envisioned opportunities.;2019;10.1088/2040-8986/ab3b1a
J;Cousins at work: How combining medical with optical imaging enhances in vivo cell tracking;Microscopy and medical imaging are related in their exploitation of electromagnetic waves, but were developed to satisfy differing needs, namely to observe small objects or to look inside subjects/objects, respectively. Together, these techniques can help elucidate complex biological processes and better understand health and disease. A current major challenge is to delineate mechanisms governing cell migration and tissue invasion in organismal development, the immune system and in human diseases such as cancer where the spatiotemporal tracking of small cell numbers in live animal models is extremely challenging. Multi-modal multi-scale in vivo cell tracking integrates medical and optical imaging. Fuelled by basic research in cancer biology and cell-based therapeutics, it has been enabled by technological advances providing enhanced resolution, sensitivity and multiplexing capabilities. Here, we review which imaging modalities have been successfully used for in vivo cell tracking and how this challenging task has benefitted from combining macroscopic with microscopic techniques.;2018;10.1016/j.biocel.2018.06.008
J;Detection of Phosphatidylcholine-Coated Gold Nanoparticles in Orthotopic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma using Hyperspectral Imaging;Nanoparticle uptake and distribution to solid tumors are limited by reticuloendothelial system systemic filtering and transport limitations induced by irregular intra-tumoral vascularization. Although vascular enhanced permeability and retention can aid targeting, high interstitial fluid pressure and dense extracellular matrix may hinder local penetration. Extravascular diffusivity depends upon nanoparticle size, surface modifications, and tissue vascularization. Gold nanoparticles functionalized with biologically-compatible layers may achieve improved uptake and distribution while enabling cytotoxicity through synergistic combination of chemotherapy and thermal ablation. Evaluation of nanoparticle uptake in vivo remains difficult, as detection methods are limited. We employ hyperspectral imaging of histology sections to analyze uptake and distribution of phosphatidylcholine-coated citrate gold nanoparticles (CGN) and silica-gold nanoshells (SGN) after tail-vein injection in mice bearing orthotopic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. For CGN, the liver and tumor showed 26.5 +/- 8.2 and 23.3 +/- 4.1 particles/100 mu m(2) within 10 mu m from the nearest source and few nanoparticles beyond 50 mu m, respectively. The spleen had 35.5 +/- 9.3 particles/100 mu m(2) within 10 mu m with penetration also limited to 50 mu m. For SGN, the liver showed 31.1 +/- 4.1 particles/100 mu m(2) within 10 mu m of the nearest source with penetration hindered beyond 30 mu m. The spleen and tumor showed uptake of 22.1 +/- 6.2 and 15.8 +/- 6.1 particles/100 mu m(2) within 10 mu m, respectively, with penetration similarly hindered. CGH average concentration (nanoparticles/mu m(2)) was 1.09 +/- 0.14 in the liver, 0.74 +/- 0.12 in the spleen, and 0.43 +/- 0.07 in the tumor. SGN average concentration (nanoparticles/mu m(2)) was 0.43 +/- 0.07 in the liver, 0.30 +/- 0.06 in the spleen, and 0.20 +/- 0.04 in the tumor. Hyperspectral imaging of histology sections enables analysis of phosphatidylcholine-coated gold-based nanoparticles in pancreatic tumors with the goal to improve nanotherapeutic efficacy.;2015;10.1371/journal.pone.0129172
J;Applying dynamic contrast enhanced MSOT imaging to intratumoral pharmacokinetic modeling;Examining the dynamics of an agent in the tumor microenvironment can offer critical insights to the influx rate and accumulation of the agent. Intratumoral kinetic characterization in the in vivo setting can further elicudate distribution patterns and tumor microenvironment. Dynamic contrast-enhanced Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomographic imaging (DCE-MSOT) acquires serial MSOT images with the administration of an exogenous contrast agent over time. We tracked the dynamics of a tumor-targeted contrast agent, HypoxiSense 680 (HS680), in breast xenograft mouse models using MSOT. Arterial input function (AIF) approach with MSOT imaging allowed for tracking HS680 dynamics within the mouse. The optoacoustic signal for HS680 was quantified using the ROI function in the ViewMSOT software. A two-compartment pharmacokinetics (PK) model constructed in MATLAB to fit rate parameters. The contrast influx (k(in)) and outflux (k(out)) rate constants predicted are k(in) = 1.96 x 10(-2) s(-1) and k(out) = 9.5 x 10(-3) s(-1) (R = 0.9945).;2018;10.1016/j.pacs.2018.07.003
J;Hyperspectral image reconstruction for diffuse optical tomography;We explore the development and performance of algorithms for hyperspectral diffuse optical tomography (DOT) for which data from hundreds of wavelengths are collected and used to determine the concentration distribution of chromophores in the medium under investigation. An efficient method is detailed for forming the images using iterative algorithms applied to a linearized Born approximation model assuming the scattering coefficient is spatially constant and known. The L-surface framework is employed to select optimal regularization parameters for the inverse problem. We report image reconstructions using 126 wavelengths with estimation error in simulations as low as 0.05 and mean square error of experimental data of 0.18 and 0.29 for ink and dye concentrations, respectively, an improvement over reconstructions using fewer specifically chosen wavelengths.

J;Translational Optical Imaging;OBJECTIVE. Optical imaging is experiencing significant technologic advances. Simultaneously, an array of specific optical imaging agents has brought new capabilities to biomedical research and is edging toward clinical use. We review progress in the translation of macroscopic optical imaging-including fluorescence-guided surgery and endoscopy, intravascular fluorescence imaging, diffuse fluorescence and optical tomography, and multispectral optoacoustics (photoacoustics)-for applications ranging from tumor resection and assessment of atherosclerotic plaques to dermatologic and breast examinations. CONCLUSION. Optical imaging could play a major role in the move from imaging of structure and morphology to the visualization of the individual biologic processes underlying disease and could, therefore, contribute to more accurate diagnostics and improved treatment efficacy.;2012;10.2214/AJR.11.8431
C;Evaluating intensity normalization for multispectral classification of carotid atherosclerotic plaque;"Intensity normalization is an important preprocessing step for automatic plaque analysis in MR images as most segmentation algorithms require the images to have a standardized intensity range. In this study, we derived several intensity normalization approaches with inspiration from expert manual analysis protocols, for classification of carotid vessel wall plaque from in vivo multispectral MRI. We investigated intensity normalization based on a circular region centered at lumen (nCircle); based on sternocleidomastoid muscle (nSCM); based on intensity scaling (nScaling); based on manually classified fibrous tissue (nManuFibrous) and based on automatic classified fibrous tissue (nAutoFibrous). The proposed normalization methods were evaluated using three metrics: (1) Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) between manual and automatic segmentation obtained by classifiers using different normalizations; (2) correlation between proposed normalizations and normalization used by expert; (3) Mahalanobis Distance between pairs of components. In the performed classification experiments, features of normalized image, smoothed, gradient magnitude and Laplacian images at multi-scales, distance to lumen, distance to outer wall, wall thickness were calculated for each vessel wall (VW) pixel. A supervised pattern recognition system, based on a linear discriminate classifier, was trained using the manual segmentation result to classify each VW pixel to be one of the four classes: fibrous tissue, lipid, calcification, and loose matrix according to the highest posterior probability. We evaluated our method on image data of 23 patients. Compared to the result of conventional square region based intensity normalization, nScaling resulted in significant increase in DSC for lipid (p = 0.006) and nAutoFibrous resulted in significant increase in DSC for calcification (p = 0.004). In conclusion, it was demonstrated that the conventional region based normalization approach is not optimal and nAutoFibrous and nScaling are promising approaches deserving further studies.";2015;10.1117/12.2080961
J;Imaging of laser-excited tissue autofluorescence bleaching rates;Experimental methodology for imaging of laser-excited tissue autofluoreseence bleaching rates has been developed and clinically tested. The fluorescence images were periodically captured from the same tissue area over a certain time, with subsequent detection of the fluorescence intensity decrease rate at each image pixel and further imaging the planar distribution of those values. Spectral features at each image pixel were analyzed with a hyperspectral imaging camera. Details of the equipment and image processing are described as well as some measurement results that confirm the feasibility of the proposed technology.

J;Multidimensional non-linear laser imaging of Basal Cell Carcinoma;We have used a multidimensional non-linear laser imaging approach to visualize ex-vivo samples of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). A combination of several non-linear laser imaging techniques involving fluorescence lifetime, multispectral two-photon and second-harmonic generation imaging has been used to image different skin layers. This approach has elucidated some morphological (supported by histopathological images), biochemical, and physiochemical differences of the healthy samples with respect to BCC ones. In particular, in comparison with normal skin, BCC showed a blue-shifted fluorescence emission, a higher fluorescence response at 800 nm excitation wavelength and a slightly longer mean fluorescence lifetime. Finally, the use of aminolevulinic acid as a contrast agent has been demonstrated to increase the constrast in tumor border detection.

J;GeTe Nanosheets as Theranostic Agents for Multimodal Imaging and Therapy of Inflammatory Bowel Disease;Recently, 2D nanomaterials have received considerable attention in nanomedicine due to their intrinsic optical properties, biocompatibility, and therapeutic effect. Here, 2D germanium telluride (GeTe) nanosheets coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (GeTe-PVP NSs) developed as theranostic agents are reported that can be used for multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) and fluorescence imaging and therapy of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). GeTe-PVP NSs, fabricated by simple sonication in ethanol and PVP, show broad optical absorption in visible and near-infrared (NIR) ranges (400-1200 nm) and have intrinsic fluorescence properties. Thus, they provide deeper ex vivo and in vivo MSOT tissue images than gold nanorods or indocyanine green with strong optical absorption in the first NIR window (700-900 nm). In addition, when orally administered to IBD mice, GeTe-PVP NSs exhibit therapeutic efficacy similar to or higher than sulfasalazine, with strong accumulation at inflammatory colon sites. This demonstrates that oral administration of GeTe-PVP NSs may be used to treat inflammatory diseases in the gastrointestinal tract.;2022;10.1002/adfm.202107433
J;Multicolor Raman Beads for Multiplexed Tumor Cell and Tissue Imaging and in Vivo Tumor Spectral Detection;Developing new nanomaterials with strong and distinctive Raman vibrations in the biological Raman-silent region (1800-2800 cm(-1)) were highly desirable for Raman hyperspectral detection and imaging in living cells and animals. Herein, polymeric nanoparticles with monomers containing alkyne, cyanide, azide, and carbon-deuterate were prepared as Raman-active nanomaterials (Raman beads) for bioimaging applications. Intense Raman signals were obtained due to the high density of alkyne, cyanide, azide, and carbon-deuterate in single nanoparticles, in absence of metal (such as Au or Ag) as Raman enhancers. We have developed a library of Raman beads for frequency multiplexing through the end capping substitutions of monomers and demonstrated five color SRS imaging of mixed nanoparticles with distinct Raman frequencies. In addition, with further surface functionalization of targeting moieties (such as nucleic acid aptamers and targeting peptides), targetable Raman beads were successfully used as probes for tumor targeting and Raman spectroscopic detection, including multicolor SRS imaging in living tumor cells and tissues with high specificity. Further in vivo studies indicated that Raman beads anchored with targeting moieties were successfully employed to target tumors in living mice after tail intravenous injection, and Raman spectral detection of tumor in live mice was achieved only through spontaneous Raman signal at the biological Raman-silent region without any signal enhancement due to a high density of Raman reporters in Raman beads. With further copolymerization of these monomers, Raman beads with supermultiplex barcoding could be readily achieved.;2019;10.1021/acs.analchem.9b00028
J;A large, switchable optical clearing skull window for cerebrovascular imaging;Rationale: Intravital optical imaging is a significant method for investigating cerebrovascular structure and function. However, its imaging contrast and depth are limited by the turbid skull. Tissue optical clearing has a great potential for solving this problem. Our goal was to develop a transparent skull window, without performing a craniotomy, for use in assessing cerebrovascular structure and function. Methods: Skull optical clearing agents were topically applied to the skulls of mice to create a transparent window within 15 min. The clearing efficacy, repeatability, and safety of the skull window were then investigated. Results: Imaging through the optical clearing skull window enhanced both the contrast and the depth of intravital imaging. The skull window could be used on 2-8-month-old mice and could be expanded from regional to bi-hemispheric. In addition, the window could be repeatedly established without inducing observable inflammation and metabolic toxicity. Conclusion: We successfully developed an easy-to-handle, large, switchable, and safe optical clearing skull window. Combined with various optical imaging techniques, cerebrovascular structure and function can be observed through this optical clearing skull window. Thus, it has the potential for use in basic research on the physiopathologic processes of cortical vessels.;2018;10.7150/thno.23686
J;Synthesis and Testing of Modular Dual-Modality Nanoparticles for Magnetic Resonance and Multispectral Photoacoustic Imaging;Magnetic resonance (MR) and photoacoustic (PA) imaging are currently being investigated as complementing strategies for applications requiring sensitive detection of cells in vivo. While combined MR/PAI detection of cells requires biocompatible cell labeling probes, water-based synthesis of dual-modality MR/PAI probes presents significant technical challenges. Here we describe facile synthesis and characterization of hybrid modular dextran-stabilized gold/iron oxide (Au-IO) multimetallic nanoparticles (NP) enabling multimodal imaging of cells. The stable association between the JO and gold NP was achieved by priming the surface of dextran-coated IO with silver NP resulting from silver(I) reduction by aldehyde groups, which are naturally present within the dextran coating of JO at the level of 19-23 groups/particle. The Au-IO NP formed in the presence of silver-primed Au-IO were stabilized by using partially thiolated MPEG5-gPLL graft copolymer carrying residual amino groups. This stabilizer served as a carrier of near-infrared fluorophores (e.g., IRDye 800RS) for multispectral PA imaging. Dual modality imaging experiments performed in capillary phantoms of purified Au-IO-800RS NPs showed that these NPs were detectible using 3T MRI at a concentration of 25 mu M iron. PA imaging achieved approximately 2.5-times higher detection sensitivity due to strong PA signal emissions at 530 and 770 nm, corresponding to gold plasmons and IRDye integrated into the coating of the hybrid NPs, respectively, with no bleaching of PA signal. MDA-MB-231 cells prelabeled with Au-IO-800RS retained plasma membrane integrity and were detectable by using both MR and dual-wavelength PA at 49 +/- 3 cells/imaging voxel. We believe that modular assembly of multimetallic NPs shows promise for imaging analysis of engineered cells and tissues with high resolution and sensitivity.;2016;10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.5b00633
J;Detection of collagens by multispectral optoacoustic tomography as an imaging biomarker for Duchenne muscular dystrophy;Biomarkers for monitoring of disease progression and response to therapy are lacking for muscle diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Noninvasive in vivo molecular imaging with multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) uses pulsed laser light to induce acoustic pressure waves, enabling the visualization of endogenous chromophores. Here we describe an application of MSOT, in which illumination in the near- and extended near-infrared ranges from 680-1,100 nm enables the visualization and quantification of collagen content. We first demonstrated the feasibility of this approach to noninvasive quantification of tissue fibrosis in longitudinal studies in a large-animal Duchenne muscular dystrophy model in pigs, and then applied this approach to pediatric patients. MSOT-derived collagen content measurements in skeletal muscle were highly correlated to the functional status of the patients and provided additional information on molecular features as compared to magnetic resonance imaging. This study highlights the potential of MSOT imaging as a noninvasive, age-independent biomarker for the implementation and monitoring of newly developed therapies in muscular diseases.;2019;10.1038/s41591-019-0669-y
J;Application of photoacoustic computed tomography in biomedical imaging: A literature review;"Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a hybrid imaging modality that combines optical excitation and acoustic detection techniques. It obtains high-resolution deep-tissue images based on the deep penetration of light, the anisotropy of light absorption in objects, and the photoacoustic effect. Hence, PACT shows great potential in biomedical sample imaging. Recently, due to its advantages of high sensitivity to optical absorption and wide scalability of spatial resolution with the desired imaging depth, PACT has received increasing attention in preclinical and clinical practice. To date, there has been a proliferation of PACT systems designed for specific biomedical imaging applications, from small animals to human organs, from ex vivo to in vivo real-time imaging, and from simple structural imaging to functional and molecular imaging with external contrast agents. Therefore, it is of great importance to summarize the previous applications of PACT systems in biomedical imaging and clinical practice. In this review, we searched for studies related to PACT imaging of biomedical tissues and samples over the past two decades; divided the studies into two categories, PACT imaging of preclinical animals and PACT imaging of human organs and body parts; and discussed the significance of the studies. Finally, we pointed out the future directions of PACT in biomedical applications. With the development of exogenous contrast agents and advances of imaging technique, in the future, PACT will enable biomedical imaging from organs to whole bodies, from superficial vasculature to internal organs, from anatomy to functions, and will play an increasingly important role in biomedical research and clinical practice.";;10.1002/btm2.10419
J;Handheld Diffuse Reflectance Spectral Imaging (DRSi) for in-vivo characterization of skin;Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy provides a noninvasive means to measure optical and physiological properties of tissues. To expand on these measurements, we have developed a handheld diffuse reflectance spectral imaging (DRSi) system capable of acquiring wide field hyperspectral images of tissue. The image acquisition time was approximately 50 seconds for a 50x50 pixel image. A transport model was used to fit each spectra for reduced scattering coefficient, hemoglobin concentration and melanin concentration resulting in optical property maps. The system was validated across biologically relevant levels of reduced scattering (5.14% error) and absorption (8.34% error) using tissue simulating phantoms. DRSi optical property maps of a pigmented skin lesion were acquired in vivo. These trends in optical properties were consistent with previous observations using point probe devices.

J;Epi-Detected Hyperspectral Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy for Label-Free Molecular Subtyping of Glioblastomas;We report the development and implementation of an epi-detected spectral-focusing hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) imaging technique for label-free biomolecular subtyping of glioblastomas (GBMs). The hyper spectral SRS imaging technique developed generates SRS image stacks (from 2800 to 3020 cm(-1) at 7 cm(-1) intervals) within 30 s through controlling the time delay between the chirped pump and Stokes beams. SRS images at representative Raman shifts (e.g., 2845, 2885, and 2935 cm(-1)) delineate the biochemical variations and morphological differences between proneural and mesenchymal subtypes of GBMs. Multivariate curve resolution (MCR) analysis on hyperspectral SRS images enables the quantification of major biomolecule distributions in mesenchymal and proneural GBMs. Further principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) together with leave-one SRS spectrum-out, cross-validation (LOOCV) yields a diagnostic sensitivity of 96.7% (29/30) and specificity of 88.9% (28/36) for differentiation between mesenchymal and proneural subtypes of GBMs. This study shows great potential of applying hyperspectral SRS imaging technique developed for rapid, label-free molecular subtyping of GBMs in neurosurgery.;2018;10.1021/acs.analchem.8b01677
J;Image processing improvements afford second-generation handheld optoacoustic imaging of breast cancer patients;Background: Since the initial breast transillumination almost a century ago, breast cancer imaging using light has been considered in different implementations aiming to improve diagnostics, minimize the number of available biopsies, or monitor treatment. However, due to strong photon scattering, conventional optical imaging yields low resolution images, challenging quantification and interpretation. Optoacoustic imaging addresses the scattering limitation and yields high-resolution visualization of optical contrast, offering great potential value for breast cancer imaging. Nevertheless, the image quality of experimental systems remains limited due to a number of factors, including signal attenuation with depth and partial view angle and motion effects, particularly in multi-wavelength measurements.Methods: We developed data analytics methods to improve the accuracy of handheld optoacoustic breast cancer imaging, yielding second-generation optoacoustic imaging performance operating in tandem with ultrasonography. Results: We produced the most advanced images yet with handheld optoacoustic examinations of the human breast and breast cancer, in terms of resolution and contrast. Using these advances, we examined optoacoustic markers of malignancy, including vasculature abnormalities, hypoxia, and inflammation, on images obtained from breast cancer patients.Conclusions: We achieved a new level of quality for optoacoustic images from a handheld examination of the human breast, advancing the diagnostic and theranostic potential of the hybrid optoacoustic-ultrasound (OPUS) examination over routine ultrasonography.;2022;10.1016/j.pacs.2022.100343
J;Functional optoacoustic imaging of moving objects using microsecond-delay acquisition of multispectral three-dimensional tomographic data;The breakthrough capacity of optoacoustics for three-dimensional visualization of dynamic events in real time has been recently showcased. Yet, efficient spectral unmixing for functional imaging of entire volumetric regions is significantly challenged by motion artifacts in concurrent acquisitions at multiple wavelengths. Here, we introduce a method for simultaneous acquisition of multispectral volumetric datasets by introducing a microsecond-level delay between excitation laser pulses at different wavelengths. Robust performance is demonstrated by real-time volumetric visualization of functional blood parametrers in human vasculature with a handheld matrix array optoacoustic probe. This approach can avert image artifacts imposed by velocities greater than 2 m/s, thus, does not only facilitate imaging influenced by respiratory, cardiac or other intrinsic fast movements in living tissues, but can achieve artifact-free imaging in the presence of more significant motion, e.g. abrupt displacements during handheld-mode operation in a clinical environment.;2014;10.1038/srep05878
J;In Vivo Multispectral Photoacoustic and Photothermal Flow Cytometry with Multicolor Dyes: A Potential for Real-Time Assessment of Circulation, Dye-Cell Interaction, and Blood Volume;Recently, photoacoustic (PA) flow cytometry (PAFC) has been developed for in vivo detection of circulating tumor cells and bacteria targeted by nanoparticles. Here, we propose multispectral PAFC with multiple dyes having distinctive absorption spectra as multicolor PA contrast agents. As a first step of our proof-of-concept, we characterized high-speed PAFC capability to monitor the clearance of three dyes (Indocyanine Green [ICG], Methylene Blue [MB], and Trypan Blue [TB]) in an animal model in vivo and in real time. We observed strong dynamic PA signal fluctuations, which can be associated with interactions of dyes with circulating blood cells and plasma proteins. PAFC demonstrated enumeration of circulating red and white blood cells labeled with ICG and MB, respectively, and detection of rare dead cells uptaking TB directly in bloodstream. The possibility for accurate measurements of various dye concentrations including Crystal Violet and Brilliant Green were verified in vitro using complementary to PAFC photothermal (PT) technique and spectrophotometry under batch and flow conditions. We further analyze the potential of integrated PAFC/PT spectroscopy with multiple dyes for rapid and accurate measurements of circulating blood volume without a priori information on hemoglobin content, which is impossible with existing optical techniques. This is important in many medical conditions including surgery and trauma with extensive blood loss, rapid fluid administration, and transfusion of red blood cells. The potential for developing a robust clinical PAFC prototype that is safe for human, and its applications for studying the liver function are further highlighted.

J;Eigenspectra optoacoustic tomography achieves quantitative blood oxygenation imaging deep in tissues;"Light propagating in tissue attains a spectrum that varies with location due to wavelength-dependent fluence attenuation, an effect that causes spectral corruption. Spectral corruption has limited the quantification accuracy of optical and optoacoustic spectroscopic methods, and impeded the goal of imaging blood oxygen saturation (sO(2)) deep in tissues; a critical goal for the assessment of oxygenation in physiological processes and disease. Here we describe light fluence in the spectral domain and introduce eigenspectra multispectral optoacoustic tomography (eMSOT) to account for wavelength-dependent light attenuation, and estimate blood sO(2) within deep tissue. We validate eMSOT in simulations, phantoms and animal measurements and spatially resolve sO(2) in muscle and tumours, validating our measurements with histology data. eMSOT shows substantial sO(2) accuracy enhancement over previous optoacoustic methods, potentially serving as a valuable tool for imaging tissue pathophysiology.";2016;10.1038/ncomms12121
J;Spatial heterogeneity of oxygenation and haemodynamics in breast cancer resolved in vivo by conical multispectral optoacoustic mesoscopy;Optoacoustic imaging: Revealing the details of tumour patterns A technique that can image the entire tumour volume with high resolution may help oncologists optimize specific treatments for breast cancer. Jiao Li (Tianjin University, China), Vasilis Ntziachristos (Technical University of Munich, Germany), and colleagues have designed a multispectral optoacoustic mesoscope (MSOM) that illuminates millimetre-sized tumours with laser light of various wavelengths, and detects the ultrasound waves generated by internal absorbers, such as haemoglobin, or external nanoparticle probes. By reconstructing the ultrasound signals over multiple frequencies, the team produced 3D images of features that included the vascular network of a tumour with micrometre-scale detail. Experiments with live mice demonstrated that specific tumours could be identified through differences in spatial patterns, such as altered oxygen levels between tumour cores and peripheries. The study highlights the power of MSOM as a tool for preclinical cancer studies. The characteristics of tumour development and metastasis relate not only to genomic heterogeneity but also to spatial heterogeneity, associated with variations in the intratumoural arrangement of cell populations, vascular morphology and oxygen and nutrient supply. While optical (photonic) microscopy is commonly employed to visualize the tumour microenvironment, it assesses only a few hundred cubic microns of tissue. Therefore, it is not suitable for investigating biological processes at the level of the entire tumour, which can be at least four orders of magnitude larger. In this study, we aimed to extend optical visualization and resolve spatial heterogeneity throughout the entire tumour volume. We developed an optoacoustic (photoacoustic) mesoscope adapted to solid tumour imaging and, in a pilot study, offer the first insights into cancer optical contrast heterogeneity in vivo at an unprecedented resolution of <50 mu m throughout the entire tumour mass. Using spectral methods, we resolve unknown patterns of oxygenation, vasculature and perfusion in three types of breast cancer and showcase different levels of structural and functional organization. To our knowledge, these results are the most detailed insights of optical signatures reported throughout entire tumours in vivo, and they position optoacoustic mesoscopy as a unique investigational tool linking microscopic and macroscopic observations.;2020;10.1038/s41377-020-0295-y
C;Multispectral photoacoustic remote sensing microscopy using 532nm and 266nm excitation wavelengths;Photoacoustic remote sensing (PARS) is a non-contact imaging modality that is based on the optical absorption contrast of endogenous molecules. PARS has shown promise in vascular imaging, blood oxygenation estimation, and virtual biopsy without the need for exogenous labels. Here we demonstrate simultaneous imaging of cell nuclei and blood using UV and visible excitation wavelengths. This is important for decoupling blood signals from cell nuclei signals in removed tissue and resection beds. A 532nm fiber laser is split with one light path frequency doubled using a CLBO crystal to 266nm. These two wavelength lasers are co-aligned and co-focused with a 1310nm interrogation beam and using a reflective objective to image microvasculature and cell nuclei with intrinsic optical absorptions at 532nm and 266nm, respectively. These images are taken serially and co-registered with lateral resolutions of 1.2 mu m and 0.44 mu m respectively. Co-alignment using multiple wavelengths is demonstrated using carbon fiber phantoms. We imaged both paraffin embedded tissue and in vivo mouse ear. Cell nuclei in sectioned tissues were clearly visualized with a SNR of 42dB while hemoglobin demonstrated an SNR of 39dB. In vivo cell nuclei and vasculature images produced an SNR up to 40dB and 35dB, respectively.;2020;10.1117/12.2546410
J;Ratio images and ultraviolet C excitation in autofluorescence imaging of neoplasms of the human colon;The accepted screening technique for colon cancer is white light endoscopy. While most abnormal growths (lesions) are detected by this method, a significant number are missed during colonoscopy, potentially resulting in advanced disease. Missed lesions are often flat and inconspicuous in color. A prototype ultraviolet spectral imager measuring autofluorescence (AF) and reflectance has been developed and applied in a study of 21 fresh human colon surgical specimens. Six excitation wavelengths from 280 to 440 nm and formulaic ratio imaging were utilized to increase lesion contrast and cause neoplasms to appear bright compared to normal tissue. It was found that in the subset of lesions which were most difficult to visualize in standard color photographs [low contrast lesions, (LCLs)] a ratio image (F340/F440) of AF images excited at 340 and 440 nm produced extraordinary images and was effective in about 70% of these difficult cases. Contrast may be due to increased levels of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, increased hemoglobin absorption, and reduced signal from submucosal collagen. A second successful ratio image (R480/R555) combined two reflectance images to produce exceptional images especially in particular LCLs where F340/F440 was ineffective. The newly discovered ratio images can potentially improve detection rate in screening with a novel AF colonoscope. (C) 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

J;Towards clinical application of non-invasive imaging to detect bacterial infections;In vivo imaging technologies offer a great potential for the diagnosis of difficult-to-treat bacterial infections. A major limitation of conventional imaging modalities is the lack of specificity to distinguish the site of bacterial infection from sterile inflammation. Targeted approaches like antibiotics linked to imaging tracers for detection of various bacterial pathogens or species-specific antibodies combined with anatomical imaging modalities are currently being evaluated to overcome this problem. Considering the recent progress in optical and targeted imaging that may accelerate preclinical development programs, clinical implementation of in vivo imaging modalities to detect bacterial infection foci becomes realistic in the future.;2018;10.1080/21505594.2018.1425072
J;Measuring Tumor Microenvironment pH During Radiotherapy Using a Novel Cerenkov Emission Multispectral Optical Probe Based on Silicon Photomultipliers;Cerenkov Emission (CE) multispectral analysis with silicon photomultiplier (SiPM)-based optical probes is a promising tool for online tumor microenvironment interrogation and targeting during radiotherapy delivery. With the extreme sensitivity of SiPMs, deep tissue multispectral CE measurements can be realized in a clinical setting. In this work, we utilize our Cerenkov Emission Multi-spectral Imaging (CMSI) prototype probe to interrogate the spectral components of the CE signal generated during external beam radiotherapy. Our results demonstrated that CMSI enables effective probing of in vitro quantitative changes in the pH of cell media to monitor cancer cell proliferation after various treatment pathways and differentiate between varying treatment resistance cell lines. In addition, the feasibility of using the CMSI probe in vivo was also successfully demonstrated by measuring tumor pH during a pilot mouse study.;2021;10.3389/fphy.2021.636001
J;A tissue factor-cascade-targeted strategy to tumor vasculature: a combination of EGFP-EGF1 conjugation nanoparticles with photodynamic therapy;Tumor requires tumor vasculature to supply oxygen and nutrients so as to support its continued growth, as well as provide a main route for metastatic spread. In this study, a TF-cascade-targeted strategy aiming to disrupt tumor blood vessels was developed by combination of TF-targeted HMME-loaded drug delivery system and PDT. PDT is a promising new modality in the treatment of cancers, which employs the interaction between a tumor-localizing photosensitizer and light of an appropriate wavelength to bring about ROS-induced cell death. In vitro results showed that protein EGFP-EGF1modification could significantly contribute to the uptake of nanoparticles by TF over-expressed BCECs. In vivo multispectral fluorescent imaging, the EGFP-EGF1 conjugated nanoparticles showed significantly higher accumulation in tumor tissues than non-conjugated ones. Tumor tissue slides further presented that EGFP-EGF1 conjugated nanoparticles showed significantly higher accumulation in tumor vasculature than non-conjugated ones. In vitro study demonstrated that PDT increased TF expression of BCECs. In vivo imaging, ex vivo imaging and tumor tissue slides showed that PDT further contribute EGFP-EGF1-NP accumulation in tumor. These promising results indicated that PDT enhanced EGFP-EGF1modified PEG-PLGA nanoparticle accumulation in tumor vaculature. Considering that EGFPEGF1 conjugation enhanced nanoparticles uptake by TF over-expressed endothelium and PDT increased endothelium TF expression. We conclude that PDT triggered a TF cascade targeted effect. A combination of both EGFP-EGF1 modification and PDT provided a positive feed-back target effect to tumor vessels and might have a great potential for tumor therapy.;2017;10.18632/oncotarget.12922
J;Deep learning applied to hyperspectral endoscopy for online spectral classification;Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is being explored in endoscopy as a tool to extract biochemical information that may improve contrast for early cancer detection in the gastrointestinal tract. Motion artefacts during medical endoscopy have traditionally limited HSI application, however, recent developments in the field have led to real-time HSI deployments. Unfortunately, traditional HSI analysis methods remain unable to rapidly process the volume of hyperspectral data in order to provide real-time feedback to the operator. Here, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to enable online classification of data obtained during HSI endoscopy. A five-layered CNN was trained and fine-tuned on a dataset of 300 hyperspectral endoscopy images acquired from a planar Macbeth ColorChecker chart and was able to distinguish between its 18 constituent colors with an average accuracy of 94.3% achieved at 8.8 fps. Performance was then tested on a set of images simulating an endoscopy environment, consisting of color charts warped inside a rigid tube mimicking a lumen. The algorithm proved robust to such variations, with classification accuracies over 90% being obtained despite the variations, with an average drop in accuracy of 2.4% being registered at the points of longest working distance and most inclination. For further validation of the color-based classification system, ex vivo videos of a methylene blue dyed pig esophagus and images of different disease stages in the human esophagus were analyzed, showing spatially distinct color classifications. These results suggest that the CNN has potential to provide color-based classification during real-time HSI in endoscopy.;2020;10.1038/s41598-020-60574-6
J;HYBRID PHOTOACOUSTIC/ULTRASOUND TOMOGRAPH FOR REAL-TIME FINGER IMAGING;We report a target-enclosing, hybrid tomograph with a total of 768 elements based on capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducer technology and providing fast, high-resolution 2-D/3-D photoacoustic and ultrasound tomography tailored to finger imaging. A freely programmable ultrasound beamforming platform sampling data at 80 MHz was developed to realize plane wave transmission under multiple angles. A multiplexing unit enables the connection and control of a large number of elements. Fast image reconstruction is provided by GPU processing. The tomograph is composed of four independent and fully automated movable arc-shaped transducers, allowing imaging of all three finger joints. The system benefits from photoacoustics, yielding high optical contrast and enabling visualization of finger vascularization, and ultrasound provides morphologic information on joints and surrounding tissue. A diode-pumped, Q-switched Nd: YAG laser and an optical parametric oscillator are used to broaden the spectrum of emitted wavelengths to provide multispectral imaging. Custom-made optical fiber bundles enable illumination of the region of interest in the plane of acoustic detection. Precision in positioning of the probe in motion is ensured by use of a motor-driven guide slide. The current position of the probe is encoded by the stage and used to relate ultrasound and photoacoustic signals to the corresponding region of interest of the suspicious finger joint. The system is characterized in phantoms and a healthy human finger in vivo. The results obtained promise to provide new opportunities in finger diagnostics and establish photoacoustic/ultrasoundtomography in medical routine.

C;In-vivo Measurements of Oxy- and Deoxyhemoglobin Levels in Breast Cancer Xenografts in a Mammary Window Chamber Model;Cancer cells are characterized by adaptive features that allow them to evade apoptosis and proliferate in an unchecked manner in the host tissue. Therapeutic strategies often involve targeting those adaptive molecular pathways leading to downstream effects such as changes in perfusion, metabolic rate, and/or oxygen utilization in the malignant tissue. Such surrogate biomarkers can be used to monitor therapeutic response, optimize treatment protocols, or assist in development of new therapeutic approaches. In this study, we present an optical methodology to make in vivo measurements of oxygen saturation as a surrogate biomarker in breast cancer xenografts within a mouse mammary window chamber (MWC) model. By using multi-spectral measurements of the reflectance off the tissue under the coverslip of the window chamber, we are able to obtain high resolution maps of the variation of oxygenation levels of the tissue, which allow continuous tracking of the level of tissue oxygenation during tumor growth and following treatment. The MWC, which was designed and fabricated in-house, is compatible with multiple imaging modalities such as MRI and high resolution intravital microscopy, providing the capability for cross validation of oxygenation measurements on multiple imaging platforms.;2014;10.1117/12.2037835
C;Limited-memory-BFGS-based Iterative Algorithm for Multispectral Bioluminescence Tomography with Huber Regularization;Multispectral bioluminescence tomography is becoming a promising tool because it can resolve the biodistibution of bioluminescent reporters associated with cellular and subcellular function through several millimeters with to centimeters of tissues in vivo. Generally, to recover the bioluminescent sources, the source reconstruction problem is formulated as a nonlinear least-squares-type bounds constrained optimization problem. However, bioluminescence tomography (BLT) is an ill-posed problem. For the sake of stability and uniqueness of BLT, many algorithms have been proposed to regularize the problem, such as L-2 norm and L-1 norm. Here, we proposed a new regularization method with Huber function to regularize BLT problem to obtain robustness like L-1 and rapid convergence of L-2. Furthermore, the computational burden is largely increased with the use of spectral data. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop a fast reconstruction algorithm for solving multispectral bioluminescence tomography. In the paper, a limited memory quasi-Newton algorithm for solving the large-scale optimization problem is proposed to fast localize the bioluminescent source. In the numerical simulation, a heterogeneous phantom was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm with the Monte Carlo based synthetic data. Additionally, the real mouse experiments were conducted to further evaluate the proposed algorithm. The results demonstrate the potential and merits of the proposed algorithm.;2010;10.1117/12.844604
J;Optimization of wavelength selection for multispectral image acquisition: a case study of atrial ablation lesions;In vivo autofluorescence hyperspectral imaging of moving objects can be challenging due to motion artifacts and to the limited amount of acquired photons. To address both limitations, we selectively reduced the number of spectral bands while maintaining accurate target identification. Several downsampling approaches were applied to data obtained from the atrial tissue of adult pigs with sites of radiofrequency ablation lesions. Standard image qualifiers such as the mean square error, the peak signal-to-noise ratio, the structural similarity index map, and an accuracy index of lesion component images were used to quantify the effects of spectral binning, an increased spectral distance between individual bands, as well as random combinations of spectral bands. Results point to several quantitative strategies for deriving combinations of a small number of spectral bands that can successfully detect target tissue. Insights from our studies can be applied to a wide range of applications. (c) 2018 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.;2018;10.1364/BOE.9.002189
J;High-Resolution Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography of the Vascularization and Constitutive Hypoxemia of Cancerous Tumors;Diversity of the design and alignment of illumination and ultrasonic transducers empower the fine scalability and versatility of optoacoustic imaging. In this study, we implement an innovative high-resolution optoacoustic mesoscopy for imaging the vasculature and tissue oxygenation within subcutaneous and orthotopic cancerous implants of mice in vivo through acquisition of tomographic projections over 180 degrees at a central frequency of 24 MHz. High-resolution volumetric imaging was combined with multispectral functional measurements to resolve the exquisite inner structure and vascularization of the entire tumor mass using endogenous and exogenous optoacoustic contrast. Evidence is presented for constitutive hypoxemia within the carcinogenic tissue through analysis of the hemoglobin absorption spectra and distribution. Morphometric readouts obtained with optoacoustic mesoscopy have been verified with high-resolution ultramicroscopic studies. The findings described herein greatly extend the applications of optoacoustic mesoscopy toward structural and multispectral functional measurements of the vascularization and hemodynamics within solid tumors in vivo and are of major relevance to basic and preclinical oncological studies in small animal models.;2016;10.1016/j.neo.2016.06.004
J;Polarization-resolved hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering microscopy for label-free biomolecular imaging of the tooth;We report the development and implementation of a rapid polarization-resolved hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy technique for label-free biomolecular imaging of the tooth. The hyperspectral SRS imaging technique developed covers both fingerprint (800-1800 cm(-1)) and high-wavenumber (2800-3600 cm(-1)) regions for tooth Raman imaging without fluorescence background interference with an imaging speed of < 0.3 s per frame of 512 x 512 pixels (similar to 1 mu s per pixel), that is, > 10(6) faster than confocal Raman imaging. Significant differences of hyperspectral SRS spectra among different tooth locations (e.g., dentin, enamel, and dentin-enamel junction) are observed, revealing the biochemical distribution differences across the tooth. Further polarization-resolved SRS imaging shows different polarization dependences related to the molecular orientation differences of various tooth locations. This work demonstrates the potential of polarization-resolved hyperspectral SRS imaging technique developed in rapidly characterizing biochemical structures and compositions as well as biomolecule organizations/orientations of the tooth without labeling.

J;Non-invasive real-time imaging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) using autofluorescence multispectral imaging technique: A novel tool for redox biology;"Detecting reactive oxygen species (ROS) that play a critical role as redox modulators and signalling molecules in biological systems currently requires invasive methods such as ROS-specific indicators for imaging and quantification. We developed a non-invasive, real-time, label-free imaging technique for assessing the level of ROS in live cells and thawed cryopreserved tissues that is compatible with in-vivo imaging. The technique is based on autofluorescence multispectral imaging (AFMI) carried out in an adapted fluorescence microscope with an expanded number of spectral channels spanning specific excitation (365 nm-495 nm) and emission (420 nm-700 nm) wavelength ranges. We established a strong quantitative correlation between the spectral information obtained from AFMI and the level of ROS obtained from CellROX staining. The results were obtained in several cell types (HeLa, PANC1 and mesenchymal stem cells) and in live kidney tissue. Additioanly,two spectral regimes were considered: with and without UV excitation (wavelengths > 400 nm); the latter being suitable for UV-sensitive systems such as the eye. Data were analyzed by linear regression combined with an optimization method of swarm intelligence. This allowed the calibration of AFMI signals to the level of ROS with excellent correlation (R = 0.84, p = 0.00) in the entire spectral range and very good correlation (R = 0.78, p = 0.00) in the limited, UV-free spectral range. We also developed a strong classifier which allowed us to distinguish moderate and high levels of ROS in these two regimes (AUC = 0.91 in the entire spectral range and AUC = 0.78 for UV-free imaging). These results indicate that ROS in cells and tissues can be imaged non-invasively, which opens the way to future clinical applications in conditions where reactive oxygen species are known to contribute to progressive disease such as in ophthalmology, diabetes, kidney disease, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.";2020;10.1016/j.redox.2020.101561
J;Design and evaluation of a device for fast multispectral time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging;The application of time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy (TRFS) to in vivo tissue diagnosis requires a method for fast acquisition of fluorescence decay profiles in multiple spectral bands. This study focusses on development of a clinically compatible fiber-optic based multispectral TRFS (ms-TRFS) system together with validation of its accuracy and precision for fluorescence lifetime measurements. It also presents the expansion of this technique into an imaging spectroscopy method. A tandem array of dichroic beamsplitters and filters was used to record TRFS decay profiles at four distinct spectral bands where biological tissue typically presents fluorescence emission maxima, namely, 390, 452, 542, and 629 nm. Each emission channel was temporally separated by using transmission delays through 200 mu m diameter multimode optical fibers of 1, 10, 19, and 28 m lengths. A Laguerre-expansion deconvolution algorithm was used to compensate for modal dispersion inherent to large diameter optical fibers and the finite bandwidth of detectors and digitizers. The system was found to be highly efficient and fast requiring a few nano-Joule of laser pulse energy and <1 ms per point measurement, respectively, for the detection of tissue autofluorescent components. Organic and biological chromophores with lifetimes that spanned a 0.8-7 ns range were used for system validation, and the measured lifetimes from the organic fluorophores deviated by less than 10% from values reported in the literature. Multi-spectral lifetime images of organic dye solutions contained in glass capillary tubes were recorded by raster scanning the single fiber probe in a 2D plane to validate the system as an imaging tool. The lifetime measurement variability was measured indicating that the system provides reproducible results with a standard deviation smaller than 50 ps. The ms-TRFS is a compact apparatus that makes possible the fast, accurate, and precise multispectral time-resolved fluorescence lifetime measurements of low quantum efficiency sub-nanosecond fluorophores.

J;Mitigating fluorescence spectral overlap in wide-field endoscopic imaging;The number of molecular species suitable for multispectral fluorescence imaging is limited due to the overlap of the emission spectra of indicator fluorophores, e.g., dyes and nanoparticles. To remove fluorophore emission cross-talk in wide-field multispectral fluorescence molecular imaging, we evaluate three different solutions: (1) image stitching, (2) concurrent imaging with cross-talk ratio subtraction algorithm, and (3) frame-sequential imaging. A phantom with fluorophore emission cross-talk is fabricated, and a 1.2-mm ultrathin scanning fiber endoscope (SFE) is used to test and compare these approaches. Results show that fluorophore emission cross-talk could be successfully avoided or significantly reduced. Near term, the concurrent imaging method of wide-field multispectral fluorescence SFE is viable for early stage cancer detection and localization in vivo. Furthermore, a means to enhance exogenous fluorescence target-to-background ratio by the reduction of tissue autofluorescence background is demonstrated.

J;Tunable and Enhanced NIR-II Luminescence from Heavily Doped Rare-Earth Nanoparticles for In Vivo Bioimaging;"The last decade has witnessed the booming development of optical imaging in the second near-infrared (NIR-II, 1000-1700 nm) window for disease screening and image-guided surgical interventions, due to the merits of multi-color observations and high spatio-temporal resolution in deep tissue. Therefore, bright and multispectral NIR-II probes are required and play a key role. Here, we report the synthesis of a set of bright rare-earth based NIR-II downshifting nanoparticles (DSNPs) with hexagonal phase (beta phase). As compared with the widely reported DSNPs (beta-NaYF4@NaYF4:20Yb/(0.5-2)A@NaYF4; A = Ho, Pr, Tm or Er) previously, we reveal that the concentrations of both sensitizers and activators can be further highly doped, not limited by the concentration quenching effect. Our results demonstrate that the optimized formula in the heavily doped DSNPs (beta-NaYF4@NaYbF4:A@NaYF4, A = 20Ho, 3Pr, 4Tm or 10Er) leads to 1.2- to 4.2-folds NIR-II luminescence enhancement. Especially for the heavily Er-doped DSNPs with long-wavelength photons extending to the NIR-IIb window (1500-1700 nm), we can further boost their luminescence through introducing a beneficial cross-relaxation and host matrix with higher phonon energy (cubic phase NaYF4@NaYbF4:10Er/5Ce@NaYF4), leading to a total of similar to 11.4-fold enhancement. The resulting biocompatible, bright NIR-II emitting DSNPs enable us to in vivo monitor the cerebral vessels through the intact scalp and skull, as well as two-color dynamic tumor imaging with high spatial resolution. This work suggests the potential of the heavily doped DSNPs for multiplexed imaging in cerebrovascular abnormalities toward the diagnosis and therapy of the cerebral diseases.";2022;10.1021/acsabm.2c00268
J;Hyperspectral microscopy of subcutaneously released silver nanoparticles reveals sex differences in drug distribution;Biomaterials have a great potential to improve human health, however in vitro and in vivo studies are necessary to provide information on their efficacy and safety. This study reports on a comprehensive evaluation of core-shell electrospun fibers loaded with silver nanoparticles (Ag NP) where the delivery rate was controlled by different sizes of Ag NP and thermoresponsive poly(n-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) hydrogel particles. Fiber meshes also contain zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NP), to improve pore structure for controlled release of Ag NP. In vitro cytotoxicity studies using cultured human A549 epithelial cells demonstrated that the ZnO NP component, which is known to cause cytotoxicity, of the fiber meshes did cause measurable cell death. In vitro antibacterial efficacy of the fiber meshes was shown with rapid and efficient growth inhibition in E. coli bacterial culture. Fiber meshes were implanted subcutaneously for up to 27 days in male and female C57BL/6 mice to evaluate the in vivo drug release and biocompatibility. Hyperspectral microscopy was used as an advanced tool to determine precise location of released Ag NP into the skin compared to the conventional tissue staining methods. Results suggested that Ag NP were continuously released over 27 days of implantation in mice. Hyperspectral imaging revealed that released Ag NP dispersed in the dermis of male mice, however, Ag NP accumulated in the hair follicles of female mice (Figure). Mice implanted with fiber meshes containing ZnO NP had better hair regrowth and wound healing, which was in contrast to in vitro cytotoxicity results. These findings suggest that these newly developed fiber meshes can have unique long-term release of drugs loaded in the fiber core and appear to be biocompatible. The differences in the sex-bias outcome suggest the opportunity for development of sex-specific drug delivery systems.;2022;10.1016/j.micron.2021.103193
C;Demo: HELICoiD Tool Demonstrator for Real-Time Brain Cancer Detection;In this paper, a demonstrator of three different elements of the EU FET HELICoiD project is introduced. The goal of this demonstration is to show how the combination of hyperspectral imaging and machine learning can be a potential solution to precise real-time detection of tumor tissues during surgical operations. The HELICoiD setup consists of two hyperspectral cameras, a scanning unit, an illumination system, a data processing system and an EMB01 accelerator platform, which hosts an MPPA-256 manycore chip. All the components are mounted fulfilling restrictions from surgical environments, as shown in the accompanying video recorded at the operating room. An in-vivo human brain hyperspectral image data base, obtained at the University Hospital Doctor Negrin in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, has been employed as input to different supervised classification algorithms (SVM, RF, NN) and to a spatial-spectral filtering stage (SVM-KNN). The resulting classification maps are shown in this demo. In addition, the implementation of the SVM-KNN classification algorithm on the MPPA EMB01 platform is demonstrated in the live demo.;2016;
J;Multispectral optoacoustic tomography for in vivo detection of lymph node metastases in oral cancer patients using an EGFR-targeted contrast agent and intrinsic tissue contrast: A proof-of-concept study;Oral cancer patients undergo diagnostic surgeries to detect occult lymph node metastases missed by preoperative structural imaging techniques. Reducing these invasive procedures that are associated with considerable morbidity, requires better preoperative detection. Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is a rapidly evolving imaging technique that may improve preoperative detection of (early-stage) lymph node metastases, enabling the identification of molecular changes that often precede structural changes in tumorigenesis. Here, we characterize the optoacoustic properties of cetuximab-800CW, a tumor-specific fluorescent tracer showing several photophysical properties that benefit optoacoustic signal generation. In this first clinical proof-of-concept study, we explore its use as optoacoustic to differentiate between malignant and benign lymph nodes. We characterize the appearance of malignant lymph nodes and show differences in the distribution of intrinsic chromophores compared to benign lymph nodes. In addition, we suggest several approaches to improve the efficiency of follow-up studies.;2022;10.1016/j.pacs.2022.100362
C;CT guided diffuse optical tomography for breast cancer imaging;Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) has attracted attentions in the last two decades due to its intrinsic sensitivity in imaging chromophores of tissues such as blood, water, and lipid. However, DOT has not been clinically accepted yet due to its low spatial resolution caused by strong optical scattering in tissues. Structural guidance provided by an anatomical imaging modality enhances the DOT imaging substantially. Here, we propose a computed tomography (CT) guided multispectral DOT imaging system for breast cancer detection. To validate its feasibility, we have built a prototype DOT imaging system which consists of a laser at wavelengths of 650 and an electron multiplying charge coupled device (EMCCD) camera. We have validated the CT guided DOT reconstruction algorithms with numerical simulations and phantom experiments, in which different imaging setup parameters, such as projection number of measurements, the width of measurement patch, have been investigated. Our results indicate that an EMCCD camera with air cooling is good enough for the transmission mode DOT imaging. We have also found that measurements at six projections are sufficient for DOT to reconstruct the optical targets with 4 times absorption contrast when the CT guidance is applied. Finally, we report our effort and progress on the integration of the multispectral DOT imaging system into a breast CT scanner.;2016;10.1117/12.2216402
J;Structural and Functional Analysis of Intact Hair Follicles and Pilosebaceous Units by Volumetric Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography;Visualizing anatomical and functional features of hair follicle development in their unperturbed environment is key in understanding complex mechanisms of hair pathophysiology and in discovery of novel therapies. Of particular interest is in vivo visualization of the intact pilosebaceous unit, vascularization of the hair bulb, and evaluation of the hair cycle, particularly in humans. Furthermore, noninvasive visualization of the sebaceous glands could offer crucial insight into the pathophysiology of follicle-related diseases and dry or seborrheic skin, in particular by combining in vivo imaging with other phenotyping, genotyping, and microbial analyses. The available imaging techniques are limited in their ability for deep tissue in vivo imaging of hair follicles and lipid-rich sebaceous glands in their entirety without biopsy. We developed a noninvasive, painless, and risk-free volumetric multispectral optoacoustic tomography method for deep tissue three-dimensional visualization of whole hair follicles and surrounding structures with high spatial resolution below 80 mu m. Herein we demonstrate on-the-fly assessment of key morphometric parameters of follicles and lipid content as well as functional oxygenation parameters of the associated capillary bed. The ease of handheld operation and versatility of the newly developed approach poise it as an indispensable tool for early diagnosis of disorders of the pilosebaceous unit and surrounding structures, and for monitoring the efficacy of cosmetic and therapeutic interventions.;2016;10.1016/j.jid.2015.09.001
C;Development of a Non-invasive LED Based Device for Adipose Tissue Thickness Measurements In Vivo;There are a number of techniques for body composition assessment in clinics and in field-surveys, but in all cases the applied methods have advantages and disadvantages. High precision imaging methods are available, though expensive and non-portable, however, the methods devised for the mass population, often suffer from the lack of precision. Therefore, the development of a safe, mobile, non-invasive, optical method that would be easy to perform, precise and low-cost, but also would offer an accurate assessment of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) both in lean and in obese persons is required. Thereof, the diffuse optical spectroscopy is advantageous over the aforementioned techniques. A prototype device using an optical method for measurement of the SAT thickness in vivo has been developed. The probe contained multiple LEDs (660nm) distributed at various distances from the photo-detector which allow different light penetration depths into the subcutaneous tissue. The differences of the reflected light intensities were used to create a non-linear model, and the computed values were compared with the corresponding thicknesses of SAT, assessed by B-mode ultrasonography. The results show that with the optical system used in this study, accurate results of different SAT thicknesses can be obtained, and imply a further potential for development of multispectral optical system to observe changes of SAT thickness as well as to determine the percentage of total body fat.;2012;10.1117/12.922704
J;Progress in Molecular Imaging in Endoscopy and Endomicroscopy for Cancer Imaging;Imaging is an essential tool for effective cancer management. Endoscopes are important medical instruments for performing in vivo imaging in hollow organs. Early detection of cancer can be achieved with surveillance using endoscopy, and has been shown to reduce mortality and to improve outcomes. Recently, great advancements have been made in endoscopic instruments, including new developments in optical designs, light sources, optical fibers, miniature scanners, and multimodal systems, allowing for improved resolution, greater tissue penetration, and multispectral imaging. In addition, progress has been made in the development of highly-specific optical probes, allowing for improved specificity for molecular targets. Integration of these new endoscopic instruments with molecular probes provides a unique opportunity for significantly improving patient outcomes and has potential to further improve early detection, image guided therapy, targeted therapy, and personalized medicine. This work summarizes current and evolving endoscopic technologies, and provides an overview of various promising optical molecular probes.;2013;10.1260/2040-2295.4.1.1
J;The clinical effectiveness of optical spectroscopy for the in vivo diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Where are we?;Objective. In this review, we evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of optical spectroscopy technologies (fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy) for the in vivo diagnosis of cervical neoplasia using both point probe and multispectral imaging approaches. Methods. We searched electronic databases using the following terms: cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, squamous intraepithelial lesion, and spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, or reflectance spectroscopy. We included studies that evaluated fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy devices for in vivo diagnosis, compared those results with biopsy results, and reported on the sensitivity and specificity of the devices tested. Results. Twenty-six studies, including seven phase 11 trials and one randomized clinical trial, met our acceptability criteria. We found several important differences across the studies including device approach (multispectral versus point probe), study population, disease classification system, and disease threshold. This heterogeneity prevented formal combination of sensitivity and specificity results. Conclusion. Optical spectroscopy has similar performance to colposcopy and may help localize lesions and therefore be an effective adjunct to colposcopy. Reports on the diagnostic accuracy of these devices should use common thresholds for the construction of receiver operating characteristic curves to enable comparisons with standard technologies and facilitate their adoption. Optical spectroscopy has also been identified for possible use as ASCUS triage and primary screening, yet neither has been sufficiently evaluated to warrant a conclusion as to their suitability in this role.

J;Repeatability of in vivo quantification of atherosclerotic carotid artery plaque components by supervised multispectral classification;To evaluate the agreement and scan-rescan repeatability of automated and manual plaque segmentation for the quantification of in vivo carotid artery plaque components from multi-contrast MRI. Twenty-three patients with 30-70 % stenosis underwent two 3T MR carotid vessel wall exams within a 1 month interval. T1w, T2w, PDw and TOF images were acquired around the region of maximum vessel narrowing. Manual delineation of the vessel wall and plaque components (lipid, calcification, loose matrix) by an experienced observer provided the reference standard for training and evaluation of an automated plaque classifier. Areas of different plaque components and fibrous tissue were quantified and compared between segmentation methods and scan sessions. In total, 304 slices from 23 patients were included in the segmentation experiment, in which 144 aligned slice pairs were available for repeatability analysis. The correlation between manual and automated segmented areas was 0.35 for lipid, 0.66 for calcification, 0.50 for loose matrix and 0.82 for fibrous tissue. For the comparison between scan sessions, the coefficient of repeatability of area measurement obtained by automated segmentation was lower than by manual delineation for lipid (9.9 vs. 17.1 mm(2)), loose matrix (13.8 vs. 21.2 mm(2)) and fibrous tissue (24.6 vs. 35.0 mm(2)), and was similar for calcification (20.0 vs. 17.6 mm(2)). Application of an automated classifier for segmentation of carotid vessel wall plaque components from in vivo MRI results in improved scan-rescan repeatability compared to manual analysis.;2015;10.1007/s10334-015-0495-2
J;Gold nanorods enable noninvasive longitudinal monitoring of hydrogels in vivo with photoacoustic tomography;Longitudinal in vivo monitoring is essential for the design and evaluation of biomaterials. An ideal method would provide three-dimensional quantitative information, high spatial resolution, deep tissue penetration, and contrast between tissue and material structures. Photoacoustic (PA) or optoacoustic imaging is a hybrid technique that allows three-dimensional imaging with high spatial resolution. In addition, photoacoustic imaging allows for imaging of vascularization based on the intrinsic contrast of hemoglobin. In this study, we investigated photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) as a tool for longitudinal monitoring of an implanted hydrogel in a small animal model. Hydrogels were loaded with gold nanorods to enhance contrast and imaged weekly for 8 weeks. PACT allowed non-invasive three-dimensional, quantitative imaging of the hydrogels over the entire 8 weeks. Quantitative volume analysis was used to evaluate the in vivo degradation kinetics of the implants which deviated slightly from in vitro predictions. Multispectral imaging allowed for the simultaneous analysis of hydrogel degradation and local vascularization. These results provide support for the substantial potential of PACT as a tool for insight into biomaterial performance in vivo.

C;Characterisation of a PVCP based tissue-mimicking phantom for Quantitative Photoacoustic Imaging;Photoacoustic imaging can provide high resolution images of tissue structure, pathology and function. As these images can be obtained at multiple wavelengths, quantitatively accurate, spatially resolved, estimates for chromophore concentration, for example, may be obtainable. Such a capability would find a wide range of clinical and pre-clinical applications. However, despite a growing body of theoretical papers on how this might be achieved, there is a noticeable lack of studies providing validated evidence that it can be achieved experimentally, either in vitro or in vivo. Well-defined, versatile and stable phantom materials are essential to assess the accuracy, robustness and applicability of multispectral Quantitative Photoacoustic Imaging (qPAI) algorithms in experimental scenarios. This study assesses the potential of polyvinyl chloride plastisol (PVCP) as a phantom material for qPAI, building on previous work that focussed on using PVCP for quality control. Parameters that might be controlled or tuned to assess the performance of qPAI algorithms were studied: broadband acoustic properties, multiwavelength optical properties with added absorbers and scatterers, and photoacoustic efficiency. The optical and acoustic properties of PVCP can be tuned to be broadly representative of soft tissue. The Gruneisen parameter is larger than expected in tissue, which is an advantage as it increases the signal-to-noise ratio of the photoacoustic measurements. Interestingly, when the absorption was altered by adding absorbers, the absorption spectra measured using high peak power nanosecond-pulsed sources (typical in photoacoustics) were repeatably different from the ones measured using the low power source in the spectrophotometer, indicative of photochemical reactions taking place.;2015;10.1117/12.2183684
J;Bessel-Beam Hyperspectral CARS Microscopy with Sparse Sampling: Enabling High-Content High-Throughput Label-Free Quantitative Chemical Imaging;Microscopy-based high-content and high-throughput analysis of cellular systems plays a central role in drug discovery. However, for contrast and specificity, the majority of assays require a fluorescent readout which always comes with the risk of alteration of the true biological conditions. In this work, we demonstrate a label-free imaging platform which combines chemically specific hyperspectral coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy with sparse sampling and Bessel beam illumination. This enabled us to screen multiwell plates at high speed, while retaining the high-content chemical analysis of hyperspectral imaging. To demonstrate the practical applicability of the method we addressed a critical side effect in drug screens, namely, drug-induced lipid storage within hepatic tissue. We screened 15 combinations of drugs and neutral lipids added to human HepG2 liver cells and developed a high-content quantitative data analysis pipeline which extracted the spectra and spatial distributions of lipid and protein components. We then used their combination to train a support vector machine discriminative algorithm. Classification of the drug responses in terms of phospholipidosis versus steatosis was achieved in a completely label-free assay.;2018;10.1021/acs.analchem.7b04039
J;Emerging Intraoperative Imaging Modalities to Improve Surgical Precision;Intraoperative imaging (IOI) is performed to guide delineation and localization of regions of surgical interest. While oncological surgical planning predominantly utilizes x-ray computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound (US), intraoperative guidance mainly remains on surgeon interpretation and pathology for confirmation. Over the past decades however, intraoperative guidance has evolved significantly with the emergence of several novel imaging technologies, including fluorescence-, Raman, photoacoustic-, and radio-guided approaches. These modalities have demonstrated the potential to further optimize precision in surgical resection and improve clinical outcomes for patients. Not only can these technologies enhance our understanding of the disease, they can also yield large imaging datasets intraoperatively that can be analyzed by deep learning approaches for more rapid and accurate pathological diagnosis. Unfortunately, many of these novel technologies are still under preclinical or early clinical evaluation. Organizations like the Intra-Operative Imaging Study Group of the European Society for Molecular Imaging (ESMI) support interdisciplinary interactions with the aim to improve technical capabilities in the field, an approach that can succeed only if scientists, engineers, and physicians work closely together with industry and regulatory bodies to resolve roadblocks to clinical translation. In this review, we provide an overview of a variety of novel IOI technologies, discuss their challenges, and present future perspectives on the enormous potential of IOI for oncological surgical navigation.;2018;10.1007/s11307-018-1227-6
J;Visualizing localized dynamic changes during epileptic seizure onset in vivo with diffuse optical tomography;Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) is a promising functional imaging modality due to its ability to provide quantitative and dynamic tomographic imaging of brain functions. This pilot study was conducted to demonstrate that DOT can be used to visualize the changes in local hemodynamics during seizures. The focal seizure was induced by microinjection of 10 mu l of 1.9 mM GABA(A) antagonist bicuculline methiodide (BMI) into the left parietal neocortex of male Harlen Sprague-Dawley rats, which was imaged by a multispectral continuous-wave DOT system. Functional images were obtained by our finite element based image reconstruction algorithm. A series of dynamic 2D images were obtained to delineate the time course of concentration changes of oxyhaemoglobin, deoxyhaemoglobin, and total hemoglobin in the rat brain during seizure onset. The BMI induced epileptic foci were localized and observed over time from the images obtained. Our results suggest that diffuse optical tomography may be a promising modality for epilepsy imaging due to its ability to localize epileptic foci as well as its potential to map the functional activity in the area of human cerebral cortex in planning of epilepsy surgery.

J;Handheld multispectral imager for quantitative skin assessment in low-resource settings;"Significance: Spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) is a quantitative imaging method to measure absorption and scattering of tissue, from which several chromophore concentrations (e.g., oxy-/deoxy-/meth-hemoglobin, melanin, and carotenoids) can be calculated. Employing a method to extract additional spectral bands from RGB components (that we named crosschannels), we designed a handheld SI-DI device to account for these pigments, using low-cost, consumer-grade components for its implementation and characterization. Aim: With only three broad spectral bands (red, green, blue, or RGB), consumer-grade devices are often too limited. We present a methodology to increase the number of spectral bands in SI-DI devices that use RGB components without hardware modification. Approach: We developed a compact low-cost RGB spectral imager using a color CMOS camera and LED-based mini projector. The components' spectral properties were characterized and additional cross-channel bands were calculated. An alternative characterization procedure was also developed that makes use of low-cost equipment, and its results were compared. The device performance was evaluated by measurements on tissue-simulating optical phantoms and in-vivo tissue. The measurements were compared with another quantitative spectroscopy method: spatial frequency domain spectroscopy (SFDS). Results: Out of six possible cross-channel bands, two were evaluated to be suitable for our application and were fully characterized (520 +/- 20 nm; 556 +/- 18 nm). The other four cross-channels presented a too low signal-to-noise ratio for this implementation. In estimating the optical properties of optical phantoms, the SFDI data have a strong linear correlation with the SFDS data (R-2 = 0.987, RMSE = 0.006 for mu(a), R-2 = 0.994, RMSE = 0.078 for it mu(s)'). Conclusions: We extracted two additional spectral bands from a commercial RGB system at no cost. There was good agreement between our device and the research-grade SFDS system. The alternative characterization procedure we have presented allowed us to measure the spectral features of the system with an accuracy comparable to standard laboratory equipment. (C) The Authors.

J;Skin chromophore mapping by smartphone RGB camera under spectral band and spectral line illumination;Significance: Multispectral imaging enables mapping of chromophore content changes in skin neoplasms, which helps to diagnose a pathology. Different types of light sources can be used for the imaging. Design of laser-based illuminators is more complicated and, consequently, they are more expensive than LED-based illuminators. On the other hand, spectral line illumination has the advantage of less complicated calculations, since only the discrete maximum wavelengths need to be considered. Spectral band and spectral line approaches for multispectral skin diagnostics have not been compared so far. This can help to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of both approaches. Aim: To compare two specific illumination modalities-spectral band and spectral line illumination-from the point of performance for mapping of in vivo skin chromophores. Approach: Three spectral images of the same skin malformations were captured by a smartphone RGB camera with two different add-on illuminators comprising LED emitters and laser emitters, respectively. Five types of benign skin neoplasms were included in our study. Concentrations of skin melanin, oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin at image pixel groups were calculated using the Beer-Lambert law. Results: Skin chromophore maps and statistical analysis of mean concentrations' changes in the neoplasms compared to the surrounding skin are presented and discussed. The data of the laser emitters led to significantly higher (similar to 10 times) increase of the oxy-hemoglobin values in vascular neoplasms and much lower deoxy-hemoglobin values, if compared to the data obtained by the LED emitters. Conclusions: Analysis of the obtained chromophore distribution maps and concentration variations in neoplasms led to conclusion that the spectral line illumination approach is more appropriate for this application. Considering only the peak wavelengths of illumination spectral bands leads to essentially different results if compared to those obtained by spectral line illumination and may cause misinterpretations in the clinical assessment of skin neoplasms.

J;Multispectral optoacoustic tomography by means of normalized spectral ratio;Quantification of biomarkers using multispectral optoacoustic tomography can be challenging due to photon fluence variations with depth and spatially heterogeneous tissue optical properties. Herein we introduce a spectral ratio approach that accounts for photon fluence variations. The performance and imaging improvement achieved with the proposed method is showcased both numerically and experimentally in phantoms and mice.

C;Photoacoustic monitoring of blood oxygenation during neurosurgical interventions;Multispectral photoacoustic ( PA) imaging is a prime modality to monitor hemodynamics and changes in blood oxygenation ( sO(2)). Although sO(2) changes can be an indicator of brain activity both in normal and in pathological conditions, PA imaging of the brain has mainly focused on small animal models with lissencephalic brains. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to investigate the usefulness of multispectral PA imaging in assessing sO(2) in a gyrencephalic brain. To this end, we continuously imaged a porcine brain as part of an open neurosurgical intervention with a handheld PA and ultrasonic ( US) imaging system in vivo. Throughout the experiment, we varied respiratory oxygen and continuously measured arterial blood gases. The arterial blood oxygenation ( SaO(2)) values derived by the blood gas analyzer were used as a reference to compare the performance of linear spectral unmixing algorithms in this scenario. According to our experiment, PA imaging can be used to monitor sO(2) in the porcine cerebral cortex. While linear spectral unmixing algorithms are well-suited for detecting changes in oxygenation, there are limits with respect to the accurate quantification of sO(2), especially in depth. Overall, we conclude that multispectral PA imaging can potentially be a valuable tool for change detection of sO(2) in the cerebral cortex of a gyrencephalic brain. The spectral unmixing algorithms investigated in this work will be made publicly available as part of the open-source software platform Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit ( MITK).;2019;10.1117/12.2509608
C;Noninvasive quantitative documentation of cutaneous inflammation in vivo using spectral imaging;Skin inflammation is often accompanied by edema and erythema. While erythema is the result of capillary dilation and subsequent local increase of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentration, edema is characterized by an increase in extracellular fluid in the dermis leading to local tissue swelling. Edema and erythema are typically graded visually. In this work we tested the potential of spectral imaging as a non-Invasive method for quantitative documentation of both the erythema and the edema reactions. As examples of dermatological conditions that exhibit skin inflammation we imaged patients suffering from acne, herpes zoster, and poison ivy rashes using a hyperspectral-imaging camera. Spectral images were acquired in the visible and near infrared part of the spectrum, where oxy-Hb and water demonstrate absorption bands. The values of apparent concentrations of oxy-Hb and water were calculated based on an algorithm that takes into account spectral contributions of deoxy-hemoglobin, melanin, and scattering. In each case examined concentration maps of oxy-Hb and water can be constructed that represent quantitative visualizations of the intensity and extent of erythema and edema correspondingly. In summary, we demonstrate that spectral imaging can be used in dermatology to quantitatively document parameters relating to skin inflammation. Applications may include monitoring of disease progression as well as efficacy of treatments.;2006;10.1117/12.647078
J;Reflectance spectra analysis for mucous assessment;This review report represents an overview of research and development on medical hyperspectral imaging technology and its applications. Spectral imaging technology is attracting attention as a new imaging modality for medical applications, especially in disease diagnosis and image-guided surgery. Considering the recent advances in imaging, this technology provides an opportunity for two-dimensional mapping of oxygen saturation (SatO(2)) of blood with high accuracy, spatial spectral imaging, and its analysis and provides detection and diagnostic information about the tissue physiology and morphology. Multispectral imaging also provides information about tissue oxygenation, perfusion, and potential function during surgery. Analytical algorithm has been examined, and indication of accurate map of relative hemoglobin concentration and SatO(2) can be indicated with preferable resolution and frame rate. This technology is expected to provide promising biomedical information in practical use. Several studies suggested that blood flow and SatO(2) are associated with gastrointestinal disorders, particularly malignant tumor conditions. The use and analysis of spectroscopic images are expected to potentially play a role in the detection and diagnosis of these diseases.;2021;10.4251/wjgo.v13.i8.822
C;Multichannel MCT/PIR-fiber detectors for fast pyrometry and multispectral sensing;MCT-detectors are the most sensitive detectors used for spectroscopic applications in the middle infrared (MIR) fingerprint region of spectra (5-15 mum), but their exploitation requires Liquid Nitrogen (LN) cooling in specialized optical dewars and precise optical alignment systems. Polycrystalline Infrared (PLR) fibers from solid solutions of AgCl/AgBr are transparent in the spectral range of 4-18 mum and have been coupled with pigtailed MCT detectors. The combination of such more advanced MCT detectors with PIR- fibers' flexibility enables remote spectroscopy of chemical reaction processes in situ or biomedical diagnostics in vivo at distances up to 20 meters from Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR)-, Tunable Diode Laser (TDL) or optical filter spectrometers. The main advantage of these multichannel MCT/PIR detectors for spectroscopy and multispectral sensing is that there is no need for costly and bulky optics and time consuming alignment procedures of the MCT detector and the dewar in relation to the IR sources used. In this study, PIR-fiber pigtailed 2 & 4 channel MCT-detectors are described for different spectroscopic applications where the fibers are assembled in a bundle for remote spectroscopy and for multispectral analysis of specific targets and characteristic wavelengths.;2000;
J;Multispectral imaging autofluorescence microscopy in colonic and gastric cancer metastatic lymph nodes;Background & Aims: The lymphadenectomy and extended lymphadenectomy procedures have been points of controversy in surgical oncology. The methods available for the detection of metastatic lymph nodes are numerous. These include lymphoscintigraphy and radiolabeled antibody detection, but in most cancers the currently used technique is sentinel lymph node identification, performed primarily through the use of immunohistochemistry. We propose the application of autofluorescence (AF)-based techniques for lymph node evaluation in colorectal and gastric tumors. Methods: We studied 30 clinical cases: 15 colorectal cancers and 15 gastric cancers. All of the patients were in the advanced stages of the disease and were candidates for adjuvant therapy. Autofluorescence microspectroscopy and multispectral imaging autofluorescence microscopy have been used to analyze the AF emission of metastatic lymph node sections, excited with 365-mn wavelength radiation. The AF spectra were recorded in the range of 400-700 nm. Monochrome AF images were acquired sequentially through interference filters peaked at 450, 550, and 650 nm, and then combined together in a single red-green-blue image. The AF pattern and the emission spectrum of metastatic lymph nodes have unique characteristics that can be used to distinguish them from the normal ones. Results: The results, compared with standard histopathologic procedures and with specific staining methods, supplied a satisfactory validation of the proposed technique, revealing the possibility of improving the actual diagnostic procedures for malignant lymph node alterations. Conclusions: with the development of appropriate instrumentation, the proposed technique could be particularly suitable in intrasurgical diagnosis of metastatic lymph nodes.;2007;10.1016/j.cgh.2006.11.013
J;Estimation of optical properties in biological tissues using Monte Carlo simulation;In this paper, the optical properties of skin lesion are determined with the help of laser reflectometry. The result is compared with the phantom and simulation values to obtain an accurate result. Surface backscattering is determined by laser reflectometry. The tissue-equivalent phantom is prepared with the help of white paraffin wax mixed with various color pigments in multiple proportions. A familiar Monte Carlo simulation is used to analyze the optical properties of the tissue. The normalized backscattered intensity ( NBI) signals from the tissue surface, measured by the output probes after digitization, are used to reconstruct the reflectance images of tissues in various layers below the skin surface. From NBI profiles measured at various locations of the tissues on the forearm, the corresponding optical parameters, the scattering (mu(s)) and absorption (mu(a)) coefficients, and the anisotropy parameter g are determined by matching these with profiles simulated by the Monte Carlo procedure. The correlation analysis between the lesion thickness and the diffuse reflectance gives the optical wavelengths which are selected for multispectral images of skin lesions. Comparison of results shows the presence of abnormal level in the tissue.;2007;10.1142/S0219519407002376
J;A hyperspectral fluorescence lifetime probe for skin cancer diagnosis;The autofluorescence of biological tissue can be exploited for the detection and diagnosis of disease but, to date, its complex nature and relatively weak signal levels have impeded its widespread application in biology and medicine. We present here a portable instrument designed for the in situ simultaneous measurement of autofluorescence emission spectra and temporal decay profiles, permitting the analysis of complex fluorescence signals. This hyperspectral fluorescence lifetime probe utilizes two ultrafast lasers operating at 355 and 440 nm that can excite autofluorescence from many different biomolecules present in skin tissue including keratin, collagen, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate), and flavins. The instrument incorporates an optical fiber probe to provide sample illumination and fluorescence collection over a millimeter-sized area. We present a description of the system, including spectral and temporal characterizations, and report the preliminary application of this instrument to a study of recently resected (<2 h) ex vivo skin lesions, illustrating its potential for skin cancer detection and diagnosis.

J;Multi-wavelength fluorescence imaging with a da Vinci Firefly-a technical look behind the scenes;The field of fluorescence-guided surgery builds on colored fluorescent tracers that have become available for different clinical applications. Combined use of complementary fluorescent emissions can allow visualization of different anatomical structures (e.g. tumor, lymphatics and nerves) in the same patient. With the aim to assess the requirements for multi-color fluorescence guidance under in vivo conditions, we thoroughly characterized two FDA-approved laparoscopic Firefly camera systems available on the da Vinci Si or da Vinci Xi surgical robot. In this process, we studied the cameras' performance with respect to the photophysical properties of the FDA-approved dyes Fluorescein and ICG. Our findings indicate that multi-wavelength fluorescence imaging of Fluorescein and ICG is possible using clinical-grade fluorescence laparoscopes, but critical factors for success include the photophysical dye properties, imaging system performance and the amount of accumulated dye. When comparing the camera performance, the Xi system provided more effective excitation (adaptions in the light source) and higher detection sensitivity (chip-on-a-tip and/or enhanced image processing) for both Fluorescein and ICG. Both systems can readily be used for multi-wavelength fluorescence imaging of Fluorescein and ICG under clinically relevant conditions. With that, another step has been made towards the routine implementation of multi-wavelength image-guided surgery concepts.;2021;10.1007/s11701-020-01170-8
C;Design of a Hyper-Spectral Imaging System for Gross Pathology of Pigmented Skin Lesions;Pigmented skin lesions (PSL) are prevalent in Asian populations and their gross pathology remains a manual, tedious task. Hyper-spectral imaging (HSI) is a non-invasive non-ionizing acquisition technique, allowing malignant tissue to be identified by its spectral signature. We set up a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system targeting cancer margin detection of PSL. Because classification among PSL is achieved via comparison of spectral signatures, appropriate calibration is necessary to ensure sufficient data quality. We propose a strategy for system building, calibration and pre-processing, under the requirements of fast acquisition and wide field of view. Preliminary results show that the HSI-based system is able to effectively resolve reflectance signatures of ex-vivo tissue.;2021;10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629512
J;Shortwave-infrared meso-patterned imaging enables label-free mapping of tissue water and lipid content;Water and lipids are key participants in many biological processes, but there are few non-invasive methods that provide quantification of these components in vivo, and none that can isolate and quantify lipids in the blood. Here we develop a new imaging modality termed shortwave infrared meso-patterned imaging (SWIR-MPI) to provide label-free, non-contact, spatial mapping of water and lipid concentrations in tissue. The method utilizes patterned hyperspectral illumination to target chromophore absorption bands in the 900-1,300nm wavelength range. We use SWIR-MPI to monitor clinically important physiological processes including edema, inflammation, and tumor lipid heterogeneity in preclinical models. We also show that SWIR-MPI can spatially map blood-lipids in humans, representing an example of non-invasive and contact-free measurements of in vivo blood lipids. Together, these results highlight the potential of SWIR-MPI to enable new capabilities in fundamental studies and clinical monitoring of major conditions including obesity, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Quantifying lipid and water content in tissues non-invasively is difficult, and no method exists to quantify lipids in blood non-invasively. Here the authors develop an imaging approach called shortwave infrared meso-patterned imaging (SWIR-MPI) to detect and spatially map tissue water and lipids in preclinical models.;2020;10.1038/s41467-020-19128-7
J;Excitation spectroscopy in multispectral optical fluorescence tomography: methodology, feasibility and computer simulation studies;Molecular probes used for in vivo optical fluorescence tomography (OFT) studies in small animals are typically chosen such that their emission spectra lie in the 680-850 nm wavelength range. This is because tissue attenuation in this spectral band is relatively low, allowing optical photons even from deep sites in tissue to reach the animal surface and consequently be detected by a CCD camera. The wavelength dependence of tissue optical properties within the 680-850 nm band can be exploited for emitted light by measuring fluorescent data via multispectral approaches and incorporating the spectral dependence of these optical properties into the OFT inverse problem-that of reconstructing underlying 3D fluorescent probe distributions from optical data collected on the animal surface. However, in the aforementioned spectral band, due to only small variations in the tissue optical properties, multispectral emission data, though superior for image reconstruction compared to achromatic data, tend to be somewhat redundant. A different spectral approach for OFT is to capitalize on the larger variations in the optical properties of tissue for excitation photons than for the emission photons by using excitation at multiple wavelengths as a means of decoding source depth in tissue. The full potential of spectral approaches in OFT can be realized by a synergistic combination of these two approaches, that is, exciting the underlying fluorescent probe at multiple wavelengths and measuring emission data multispectrally. In this paper, we describe a method that incorporates both excitation and emission spectral information into the OFT inverse problem. We describe a linear algebraic formulation of the multiple wavelength illumination-multispectral detection forward model for OFT and compare it to models that use only excitation at multiple wavelengths or those that use only multispectral detection techniques. This study is carried out in a realistic inhomogeneous mouse atlas using singular value decomposition and analysis of reconstructed spatial resolution versus noise. For simplicity, quantitative results have been shown for one representative fluorescent probe (Alexa 700(R)) and effects due to tissue autofluorescence have not been taken into account. We also demonstrate the performance of our method for 3D reconstruction of tumors in a simulated mouse model of metastatic human hepatocellular carcinoma.;2009;10.1088/0031-9155/54/15/004
C;High-speed photoacoustic imaging using an LED-based photoacoustic imaging system;Recently we developed a multispectral LED-based photoacoustic/ultrasound imaging system (AcousticX) and have been continuously working on its technical/functional improvements. AcousticX is a linear array ultrasound transducer (128 elements, 10 MHz)-based system in which LED arrays (selectable wavelengths, pulse repetition frequency: 4 kHz, pulse width: tunable from 40 - 100 ns) are fixed on both sides of the transducer to illuminate the tissue for photoacoustic imaging. The ultrasound/photoacoustic data from all 128 elements can be simultaneously acquired, processed and displayed. We already demonstrated our system's capability to perform photoacoustic/ultrasound imaging for dynamic imaging of the tissue at a frame rate of 10 Hz (for example to visualize the pulsation of arteries in vivo in human subjects). In this work, we present the development of a new high-speed imaging mode in AcousticX. In this mode, instead of toggling between ultrasound and photoacoustic measurements, it is possible to continuously acquire only photoacoustic data for 1.5 seconds with a time interval of 1 ms. With this improvement, we can record photoacoustic signals from the whole aperture (38 mm) at fast rate and can be reviewed later at different speeds for analyzing dynamic changes in the photoacoustic signals. We believe that AcousticX with this new high-speed mode opens up a feasible technical path for multiple dynamic studies, for example one which focus on imaging the response of voltage sensitive dyes. We envisage to improve the acquisition speed further in future for exploring ultra-high-speed applications.;2018;10.1117/12.2289391
C;Multispectral imaging technique for skin grafts' functional state assessment;"The development of express method for assessing the state of skin graft by the spectroscopic properties of tissue components involved in the healing of the affected skin or healing of skin grafts was carried out in present work. The proposed method for assessing the state of the skin by the spectroscopic properties of tissue components (using photosensitizers, fluorescent dyes (methylene blue and IcG) and nanophotosensitizers aluminum phthalocyanine nanoparticles (NP-AlPc) applied locally) will evaluate the physiological condition of the skin and assess the degree and rate of engraftment or rejection while also controlling several biochemical and physiological parameters in the entire graft, or the whole area of the skin lesions. Such parameters include the oxygenation of hemoglobin in the tissue microvasculature; the blood supply level; blood flow and lymph flow; assessment of intracellular metabolism; assessment of the cellular respiration type (aerobic/anaerobic). To assess the extent of inflammation the spectrally sensitive to biological environment nanoparticles of aluminum phthalocyanine (NP-AlPc) were also used.";2018;10.1117/12.2309783
J;Spatial frequency domain imaging: a quantitative, noninvasive tool for in vivo monitoring of burn wound and skin graft healing;There is a need for noninvasive, quantitative methods to characterize wound healing in the context of longitudinal investigations related to regenerative medicine. Such tools have the potential to inform the assessment of wound status and healing progression and aid the development of new treatments. We employed spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) to characterize the changes in optical properties of tissue during wound healing progression in a porcine model of split-thickness skin grafts and also in a model of burn wound healing with no graft intervention. Changes in the reduced scattering coefficient measured using SFDI correlated with structural changes reported by histology of biopsies taken concurrently. SFDI was able to measure spatial inhomogeneity in the wounds and predicted heterogeneous healing. In addition, we were able to visualize differences in healing rate, depending on whether a wound was debrided and grafted, versus not debrided and left to heal without intervention apart from topical burn wound care. Changes in the concentration of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin were also quantified, giving insight into hemodynamic changes during healing. (C) The Authors.

J;Depolarization imaging for fast and non-invasive monitoring of cervical microstructure remodeling in vivo during pregnancy;The cervix plays a crucial role in conception, maintenance of pregnancy, and childbirth. The mechanical properties of a pregnant woman's cervix change dramatically during gestation due to a remodeling of its microstructure, necessary for delivery. However, external factors can accelerate this process and lead to prematurity, the primary cause of perinatal mortality worldwide, due to the inefficiency of existing diagnostic methods. This study shows that polarized light is a powerful tool to probe the cervical microstructure during pregnancy. A wide-field multispectral polarimetric imaging system was fabricated to explore in vivo the cervix of full-term pregnant women. The polarimetric properties of the cervix change significantly with pregnancy progression. In particular, a set of several depolarization parameters (intrinsic and extrinsic) showed a strong linear correlation with gestational age in the red part of the visible spectral range. This trend can be attributed, among other things, to a decrease in collagen density and an increase in hydration of cervical connective tissue. Wide field depolarization imaging is a very promising tool for rapid and non-invasive analysis of cervical tissue in vivo to monitor the steady progression of pregnancy, providing the practitioner with useful information to improve the detection of preterm birth.;2022;10.1038/s41598-022-15852-w
C;Evaluation of a novel laparoscopic camera for characterization of renal ischemia in a porcine model using digital light processing (DLP) hyperspectral imaging;"Introduction: Digital light processing hyperspectral imaging (DLP (R) HSI) was adapted for use during laparoscopic surgery by coupling a conventional laparoscopic light guide with a DLP-based Agile Light source (OL 490, Optronic Laboratories, Orlando, FL), incorporating a 0(0) laparoscope, and a customized digital CCD camera (DVC, Austin, TX). The system was used to characterize renal ischemia in a porcine model. Methods: Laparoscopic DLP (R) HSI was performed in 2 groups of uni-nephric adult pigs that were each subjected to 90 minutes of warm ischemia. Group 1 (n=5) received tadalafil to mitigate ischemia/reperfusion injury while Group 2 (n=4) received no treatment. HSI-derived percentage of oxygenated hemoglobin (%HbO(2)) was plotted against time before, during and after ischemia. Serum creatinine measured pre-ischemia (D0), and on days 1, 3 and 7 post-ischemia, was correlated with %HbO(2) using the Spearman's rank test. %HbO(2) was compared for the groups using the Student's t-test. Results: Mean baseline and nadir %HbO(2) for tadalafil vs. controls was 74% vs. 75% and 50% vs. 54% respectively; values did not significantly differ between the groups at any sampled time point. D0 creatinine was significantly lower for the tadalafil group, but creatinine at all other time points was similar between the groups. Baseline and nadir %HbO(2) significantly correlated with D7 and D0 creatinine respectively in the tadalafil group alone. Conclusion: Laparoscopic DLP (R) HSI effectively characterizes renal ischemia, appears to be sensitive to changes in local blood flow, and is predictive of renal functional injury. Further parameterization and technological improvement is required before clinical incorporation.";2012;10.1117/12.907395
J;Short-wave infrared light imaging measures tissue moisture and distinguishes superficial from deep burns;"Existing clinical approaches and tools to measure burn tissue destruction are limited resulting in misdiagnosis of injury depth in over 40% of cases. Thus, our objective in this study was to characterize the ability of short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging to detect moisture levels as a surrogate for tissue viability with resolution to differentiate between burns of various depths. To accomplish our aim, we constructed an imaging system consisting of a broad-band Tungsten light source; 1,200-, 1,650-, 1,940-, and 2,250-nm wavelength filters; and a specialized SWIR camera. We initially used agar slabs to provide a baseline spectrum for SWIR light imaging and demonstrated the differential absorbance at the multiple wavelengths, with 1,940 nm being the highest absorbed wavelength. These spectral bands were then demonstrated to detect levels of moisture in inorganic and in vivo mice models. The multiwavelength SWIR imaging approach was used to diagnose depth of burns using an in vivo porcine burn model. Healthy and injured skin regions were imaged 72 hours after short (20 seconds) and long (60 seconds) burn application, and biopsies were extracted from those regions for histologic analysis. Burn depth analysis based on collagen coagulation histology confirmed the formation of superficial and deep burns. SWIR multispectral reflectance imaging showed enhanced intensity levels in long burned regions, which correlated with histology and distinguished between superficial and deep burns. This SWIR imaging method represents a novel, real-time method to objectively distinguishing superficial from deep burns.";2020;10.1111/wrr.12779
C;Non-invasive measurement of oxygen saturation in optic nerve head tissue;We describe a non-invasive in vivo hyperspectral imaging technique for visualizing the spatial distribution of retina and optic nerve head (ONH) tissue oxygenation. Real time images of the fundus are acquired with continuous wavelengths (410-918 nm) to generate a data cube consisting of one spectral and two spatial dimensions. Reflected light from the one-dimensional (1-D) area of the sample is first passed through a grating and is then imaged onto a 12-bit silicone charge-coupled device (CCD) detector. A scanner then proceeds to the next 1-D area of the sample. Acquired image frames contain 256 spatial pixels and 256 wavelengths along rows and columns. Image sequences are scanned along the perpendicular spatial dimension using the push-broom method, whereby the spectrograph and camera are translated under constant velocity with respect to the fundus camera image over 6.6 mm of travel. This set of acquired images contains the full reflected light spectrum at each pixel of a two dimensional area of the retina and ONH. The system employs a focal plane scanner (FPS) using a linear actuator to provide motion. An algorithm processes spectral information at each pixel to represent the varying spatial distribution of retina and ONH tissue oxygenation. Imaging data are obtained from ONH tissue at both normal intraocular pressure (IOP) and acutely raised IOP.;2004;10.1117/12.527803
C;Visualization of hemodynamics and light scattering in exposed brain of rat using multispectral image reconstruction based on Wiener estimation method;We investigate a method to estimate the spectral images of reduced scattering coefficients and the absorption coefficients of in vivo exposed brain tissues in the range from visible to near-infrared wavelength (500-760 nm) based on diffuse reflectance spectroscopy using a digital RGB camera. In the proposed method, the multi-spectral reflectance images of in vivo exposed brain are reconstructed from the digital red, green, blue images using the Wiener estimation algorithm. The Monte Carlo simulation-based multiple regression analysis for the absorbance spectra is then used to specify the absorption and scattering parameters of brain tissue. In this analysis, the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin and that of deoxygenated hemoglobin are estimated as the absorption parameters whereas the scattering amplitude a and the scattering power b in the expression of mu(s)'=a lambda(-b) as the scattering parameters, respectively. The spectra of absorption and reduced scattering coefficients are reconstructed from the absorption and scattering parameters, and finally, the spectral images of absorption and reduced scattering coefficients are estimated. We performed simultaneous recordings of spectral diffuse reflectance images and of the electrophysiological signals for in vivo exposed rat brain during the cortical spreading depression evoked by the topical application of KCl. Changes in the total hemoglobin concentration and the tissue oxygen saturation imply the temporary change in cerebral blood flow during CSD. Change in the reduced scattering coefficient was observed before the profound increase in the total hemoglobin concentration, and its occurrence was synchronized with the negative dc shift of the local field potential.;2015;10.1117/12.2183759
C;Multispectral detection of cutaneous lesions using spectroscopy and microscopy approaches;Autofluorescence, diffuse-reflectance and transmission spectral, and microscopic measurements were made on different cutaneous neoplastic lesions, namely basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, and dysplastic and benign lesions related. Spectroscopic measurements were made on ex vivo tissue samples, and confocal microscopy investigations were made on thin tissue slices. Fluorescence spectra obtained reveal statistically significant differences between the different benign, dysplastic and malignant lesions by the level of emission intensity, as well by spectral shape, which are fingerprints applicable for differentiation algorithms. In reflectance mode the most significant differences are related to the influence of skin pigments - melanin and hemoglobin. Transmission spectroscopy mode gave complementary optical properties information about the tissue samples investigated to that one of reflectance and absorption spectroscopy. Using autofluorescence detection of skin lesions we obtain very good diagnostic performance for distinguishing of non-melanoma lesions. Using diffuse reflectance and transmission spectroscopy we obtain significant tool for pigmented pathologies differentiation, but it is a tool with moderate sensitivity for non-melanoma lesions detection. One could rapidly increase the diagnostic accuracy of the received combined optical biopsy method when several spectral detection techniques are applied in common algorithm for lesions' differentiation. Specific spectral features observed in each type of lesion investigated on micro and macro level would be presented and discussed. Correlation between the spectral data received and the microscopic features observed would be discussed in the report.;2018;10.1117/12.2289119
J;Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) of Human Breast Cancer;"Purpose: In a pilot study, we introduce fast handheld multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) of the breast at 28 wavelengths, aiming to identify high-resolution optoacoustic (photoacoustic) patterns of breast cancer and noncancerous breast tissue. Experimental Design: We imaged 10 female patients ages 4881 years with malignant nonspecific breast cancer or invasive lobular carcinoma. Three healthy volunteers ages 31-36 years were also imaged. Fast-MSOT was based on unique single-frame-per-pulse (SFPP) image acquisition employed to improve the accuracy of spectral differentiation over using a small number of wavelengths. Breast tissue was illuminated at the 700-970 nm spectral range over 0.56 seconds total scan time. MSOT data were guided by ultrasonography and X-ray mammography or MRI. Results: The extended spectral range allowed the computation of oxygenated hemoglobin (HBO2), deoxygenated hemoglobin (HB), total blood volume (TBV), lipid, and water contributions, allowing first insights into in vivo high-resolution breast tissue MSOT cancer patterns. TBV and Hb/HBO2 images resolved marked differences between cancer and control tissue, manifested as a vessel-rich tumor periphery with highly heterogeneous spatial appearance compared with healthy tissue. We observe significant TBV variations between different tumors and between tumors over healthy tissues. Water and fat lipid layers appear disrupted in cancer versus healthy tissue; however, offer weaker contrast compared with TBV images. Conclusions: In contrast to optical methods, MSOT resolves physiologic cancer features with high resolution and revealed patterns not offered by other radiologic modalities. The new features relate to personalized and precision medicine potential. (C) 2017 AACR.";2017;10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-16-3200
J;Extended Blind End-Member and Abundance Extraction for Biomedical Imaging Applications;In some applications of biomedical imaging, a linear mixture model can represent the constitutive elements (end-members) and their contributions (abundances) per pixel of the image. In this work, the extended blind end-member and abundance extraction (EBEAE) methodology is mathematically formulated to address the blind linear unmixing (BLU) problem subject to positivity constraints in optical measurements. The EBEAE algorithm is based on a constrained quadratic optimization and an alternated least-squares strategy to jointly estimate end-members and their abundances. In our proposal, a local approach is used to estimate the abundances of each end-member by maximizing their entropy, and a global technique is adopted to iteratively identify the end-members by reducing the similarity among them. All the cost functions are normalized, and four initialization approaches are suggested for the end-members matrix. Synthetic datasets are used first for the EBEAE validation at different noise types and levels, and its performance is compared to state-of-the-art algorithms in BLU. In a second stage, three experimental biomedical imaging applications are addressed with EBEAE: m-FLIM for chemometric analysis in oral cavity samples, OCT for macrophages identification in post-mortem artery samples, and hyper-spectral images for in-vivo brain tissue classification and tumor identification. In our evaluations, EBEAE was able to provide a quantitative analysis of the samples with none or minimal a priori information.;2019;10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2958985
J;Smartphone snapshot mapping of skin chromophores under triple-wavelength laser illumination;Chromophore distribution maps are useful tools for skin malformation severity assessment and for monitoring of skin recovery after burns, surgeries, and other interactions. The chromophore maps can be obtained by processing several spectral images of skin, e.g., captured by hyperspectral or multispectral cameras during seconds or even minutes. To avoid motion artifacts and simplify the procedure, a single-snapshot technique for mapping melanin, oxyhemoglobin, and deoxyhemoglobin of in-vivo skin by a smartphone under simultaneous three-wavelength (448-532-659 nm) laser illumination is proposed and examined. Three monochromatic spectral images related to the illumination wavelengths were extracted from the smartphone camera RGB image data set with respect to crosstalk between the RGB detection bands. Spectral images were further processed accordingly to Beer's law in a three chromophore approximation. Photon absorption path lengths in skin at the exploited wavelengths were estimated by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The technique was validated clinically on three kinds of skin lesions: nevi, hemangiomas, and seborrheic keratosis. Design of the developed add-on laser illumination system, image-processing details, and the results of clinical measurements are presented and discussed.

C;Out of Distribution Detection for Intra-operative Functional Imaging;Multispectral optical imaging is becoming a key tool in the operating room. Recent research has shown that machine learning algorithms can be used to convert pixel-wise reflectance measurements to tissue parameters, such as oxygenation. However, the accuracy of these algorithms can only be guaranteed if the spectra acquired during surgery match the ones seen during training. It is therefore of great interest to detect so-called out of distribution (OoD) spectra to prevent the algorithm from presenting spurious results. In this paper we present an information theory based approach to OoD detection based on the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC). Our work builds upon recent methodology related to invertible neural networks (INN). Specifically, we make use of an ensemble of INNs as we need their tractable Jacobians in order to compute the WAIC. Comprehensive experiments with in silico, and in vivo multispectral imaging data indicate that our approach is well-suited for OoD detection. Our method could thus be an important step towards reliable functional imaging in the operating room.;2019;10.1007/978-3-030-32689-0_8
J;Multispectral imaging and artificial neural network: mimicking the management decision of the clinician facing pigmented skin lesions;Various instruments based on acquisition and elaboration of images of pigmented skin lesions have been developed in an attempt to in vivo establish whether a lesion is a melanoma or not. Although encouraging, the response of these instruments, e.g. epiluminescence microscopy, reflectance spectrophotometry and fluorescence imaging, cannot currently replace the well-established diagnostic procedures. However, in place of the approach to instrumentally assess the diagnosis of the lesion, recent studies suggest that instruments should rather reproduce the assessment by an expert clinician of whether a lesion has to be excised or not. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a spectrophotometric system to mimic such a decision. The study involved 1794 consecutively recruited patients with 1966 doubtful cutaneous pigmented lesions excised for histopathological diagnosis and 348 patients with 1940 non- excised lesions because clinically reassuring. Images of all these lesions were acquired in vivo with a multispectral imaging system. The data set was randomly divided into a train (802 reassuring and 1003 excision- needing lesions, including 139 melanomas), a verify (464 reassuring and 439 excision-needing lesions, including 72 melanomas) and a test set (674 reassuring and 524 excision- needing lesions, including 76 melanomas). An artificial neural network (ANN(1)) was set up to perform the classification of the lesions as excision- needing or reassuring, according to the expert clinicians' decision on how to manage each examined lesion. In the independent test set, the system was able to emulate the clinicians with a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 80%. Of the 462 correctly classified as excision-needing lesions, 72 ( 95%) were melanomas. No major variations in receiver operating characteristic curves were found between the test and the train/ verify sets. On the same data set, a further artificial neural network (ANN(2)) was then architected to perform classification of the lesions as melanoma or nonmelanoma, according to the histological diagnosis. Having set the sensitivity in recognizing melanoma to 95%, ANN(1) resulted to be significantly better in the classification of reassuring lesions than ANN2. This study suggests that multispectral image analysis and artificial neural networks could be used to support primary care physicians or general practitioners in identifying pigmented skin lesions that require further investigations.;2007;10.1088/0031-9155/52/9/018
J;Clinical label-free biochemical and metabolic fluorescence lifetime of and cancerous oral lesions;"Introduction: Incomplete head and neck cancer resection occurs in up to 85% of cases, leading to increased odds of local recurrence and regional metastases; thus, image-guided surgical tools for accurate, in situ and fast detection of positive margins during head and neck cancer resection surgery are urgently needed. Oral epithelial dysplasia and cancer development is accompanied by morphological, biochemical, and metabolic tissue and cellular alterations that can modulate the autofluorescence properties of the oral epithelial tissue. Objective: This study aimed to test the hypothesis that autofluorescence biomarkers of oral precancer and cancer can be clinically imaged and quantified by means of multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) endoscopy. Methods: Multispectral autofluorescence lifetime images of precancerous and cancerous lesions from 39 patients were imaged in vivo using a novel multispectral FLIM endoscope and processed to generate widefield maps of biochemical and metabolic autofluorescence biomarkers of oral precancer and cancer. Results: Statistical analyses applied to the quantified multispectral FLIM endoscopy based autofluorescence biomarkers indicated their potential to provide contrast between precancerous/cancerous vs. healthy oral epithelial tissue. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first demonstration of label-free biochemical and metabolic clinical imaging of precancerous and cancerous oral lesions by means of widefield multispectral autofluorescence lifetime endoscopy. Future studies will focus on demonstrating the capabilities of endogenous multispectral FLIM endoscopy as an image-guided surgical tool for positive margin detection during head and neck cancer resection surgery.";2020;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2020.104635
J;Rare-earth-doped biological composites as in vivo shortwave infrared reporters;The extension of in vivo optical imaging for disease screening and image-guided surgical interventions requires brightly emitting, tissue-specific materials that optically transmit through living tissue and can be imaged with portable systems that display data in real-time. Recent work suggests that a new window across the short-wavelength infrared region can improve in vivo imaging sensitivity over near infrared light. Here we report on the first evidence of multispectral, real-time short-wavelength infrared imaging offering anatomical resolution using brightly emitting rare-earth nanomaterials and demonstrate their applicability toward disease-targeted imaging. Inorganic-protein nanocomposites of rare-earth nanomaterials with human serum albumin facilitated systemic biodistribution of the rare-earth nanomaterials resulting in the increased accumulation and retention in tumour tissue that was visualized by the localized enhancement of infrared signal intensity. Our findings lay the groundwork for a new generation of versatile, biomedical nanomaterials that can advance disease monitoring based on a pioneering infrared imaging technique.;2013;10.1038/ncomms3199
J;Fluorescent human lung macrophages analyzed by spectral confocal laser scanning microscopy and multispectral cytometry;Numerous highly fluorescent macrophages (M Phi), designated smoker cells, exist in the lungs of smokers and subjects who have quit smoking within 5 years. The brightly fluorescent M Phi, however, are not present in the lungs of never smokers. Some investigators have speculated that the intense fluorescence of the M Phi is due to smoke-induced changes in the autofluorescence of naturally occurring (i.e., endogenous) compounds (e.g., NADP). In contrast, other researchers have theorized that the fluorescence is due to the uptake of tobacco smoke particulates (i.e., tar). Studies reported herein were undertaken to test the hypothesis that the origin of the M Phi fluorescence could be profiled with the novel technologies afforded by spectral confocal laser scanning microscopy (sCLSM) and multispectral cytometry (MSC). To this end, spectral emissions were obtained by sCLSM of optical sections of live M Phi isolated from fresh surgically excised human lung tissue and in air-dried lung tissue imprints. Confirmation of spectral profiles of these single cell observations was obtained in population studies with the use of high-throughput MSC in which multispectral analyses were performed with three different lasers. Proof of concept experiments demonstrated that relatively nonfluoreseent M Phi from the lungs of nonsmokers became fluorescent upon short-term ex vivo exposure to tobacco smoke tar. Summarily, the studies reported herein document that the fluorescence of human lung M Phi is due to tobacco tar.;2005;10.1002/jemt.20191
J;Detection of intramyocardially injected DiR-labeled mesenchymal stem cells by optical and optoacoustic tomography;The distribution of intramyocardially injected rabbit MSCs, labeled with the near-infrared dye 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindotricarbo-cyanine-iodide (DiR) using hybrid Fluorescence Molecular Tomography-X-ray Computed Tomography (FMT-XCT) and Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) imaging technologies, was investigated. Viability and induction of apoptosis of DiR labeled MSCs were assessed by XTT-and Caspase-3/-7-testing in vitro. 2 x 10(6), 2 x 10(5) and 2 x 10(4) MSCs labeled with 5 and 10 mu g DiR/ml were injected into fresh frozen rabbit hearts. FMT-XCT, MSOT and fluorescence cryosection imaging were performed. Concentrations up to 10 mu g DiR/ml did not cause apoptosis in vitro (p > 0.05). FMT and MSOT imaging of labeled MSCs led to a strong signal. The imaging modalities highlighted a difference in cell distribution and concentration correlated to the number of injected cells. Ex-vivo cryosectioning confirmed the molecular fluorescence signal. FMT and MSOT are sensitive imaging techniques offering high-anatomic resolution in terms of detection and distribution of intramyocardially injected stem cells in a rabbit model.

J;Beam scanning for rapid coherent Raman hyperspectral imaging;Coherent Raman imaging requires high-peak power laser pulses to maximize the nonlinear multiphoton signal generation, but accompanying photo-induced sample damage often poses a challenge to microscopic imaging studies. We demonstrate that beam scanning by a 3.5-kHz resonant mirror in a broadband coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (BCARS) imaging system can reduce photo-induced damage without compromising signal intensity. Additionally, beam scanning enables slit acquisition, in which spectra from a thin line of sample illumination are acquired in parallel during a single charge-coupled device exposure. Reflective mirrors are employed in the beam-scanning assembly to minimize chromatic aberration and temporal dispersion. The combined approach of beam scanning and slit acquisition is compared with the sample-scanning mode in terms of spatial resolution, photo-induced damage, and imaging speed at the maximum laser power below the sample-damage threshold. We show that the beam-scanning BCARS imaging method can reduce photodamage probability in biological cells and tissues, enabling faster imaging speed by using a higher excitation laser power than could be achieved without beam scanning.;2015;10.1364/OL.40.005826
J;In vivo spectroscopy: optical fiber probes for clinical applications;Introduction Fiber optic probe-based in vivo spectroscopy techniques are fast and highly objective methods for intraoperative diagnoses and minimally invasive surgical interventions for all procedures where endoscopic observations are carried out for cancers of different types. The Raman spectral features provide molecular fingerprint-type information and can reveal the subjects' pathological state in label-free manner, making endoscopy multiplexed fiber optic probe-based devices with the potential for translation from bench to bedside for routine applications. Areas Covered This review provides a general overview of different fiber-optic probes for in vivo measurements with emphasis on Raman spectroscopy for biomedical application. Various aspects such as fiber-optic probe, radiation source, detector, and spectrometer for extracting optimum spectral features have also been discussed. Expert opinion Optical spectroscopy-based fiber probe systems with 'Chip-on-Tip' technology, combined with machine learning, can in the near future, become a complementary diagnostic tool to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound, etc. Hyperspectral imaging and fluorescence-based devices are in the advanced stage of technology readiness level (TRL), and with advances in lasers and miniature spectroscopy systems, probe-based Raman devices are also coming up.;2022;10.1080/17434440.2022.2130046
C;In-Vivo Quantitative Evaluation of Perfusion Zones and Perfusion Gradient in the Deep Inferior Epigastric Artery Perforator Flap;The selection of well-vascularized tissue during DIEP flap harvest remains controversial. While several studies have elucidated cross-midline perfusion, further characterization of perfusion to the ipsilateral hemiabdomen is necessary for minimizing rates of fat necrosis or partial fat necrosis in bilateral DIEP flaps. Eighteen patients (29 flaps) underwent DIEP flap harvest using a prospectively designed protocol. Perforators were marked and imaged with a novel system for quantitatively measuring tissue oxygenation, the Digital Light Hyperspectral Imager. Images were then analyzed to determine if perforator selection influenced ipsilateral flap perfusion. Flaps based on a single lateral row perforator (SLRP) were found to have a higher level of hemoglobin oxygenation in Zone I (mean %HbO(2) = 76.1) compared to single medial row perforator (SMRP) flaps (%HbO(2) = 71.6). Perfusion of Zone III relative to Zone I was similar between SLRP and SMRP flaps (97.4% vs. 97.9%, respectively). These differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05). Perfusion to the lateral edge of the flap was slightly greater for SLRP flaps compared SMRP flaps (92.1% vs. 89.5%, respectively). SMRP flaps had superior perfusion travelling inferiorly compared to SLRP flaps (88.8% vs. 83.9%, respectively). Overall, it was observed that flaps were better perfused in the lateral direction than inferiorly. Significant differences in perfusion gradients directed inferiorly or laterally were observed, and perforator selection influenced perfusion in the most distal or inferior aspects of the flap. This suggests broader clinical implications for flap design that merit further investigation.;2013;10.1117/12.2004972
J;Acceleration of brain cancer detection algorithms during surgery procedures using GPUs;The HypErspectraL Imaging Cancer Detection (HELICoiD) European project aims at developing a methodology for tumor tissue classification through hyperspectral imaging (HSI) techniques. This paper describes the development of a parallel implementation of the Support Vector Machines (SVMs) algorithm employed for the classification of hyperspectral (HS) images of in vivo human brain tissue. SVM has demonstrated high accuracy in the supervised classification of biological tissues, and especially in the classification of human brain tumor. In this work, both the training and the classification stages of the SVMs were accelerated using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The acceleration of the training stage allows incorporating new samples during the surgical procedures to create new mathematical models of the classifier. Results show that the developed system is capable to perform efficient training and real-time compliant classification.;2018;10.1016/j.micpro.2018.06.005
J;Multispectral interlaced sparse sampling photoacoustic tomography based on directional total variation;Background and objective: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is capable of obtaining cross-sectional images of small animals that represent the optical absorption of biological tissues. The multispectral Interlaced Sparse Sampling PAT, or ISS-PAT, is a previously proposed PAT imaging method that offered high quality images with much sparser transducer angular coverage. Although it provides superior imaging performance, the original ISS-PAT method suffered from a heavy computation burden, which hinders its practical application. Methods: Here, we propose a new regularization scheme based on the directional total variation (dTV) for ISS-PAT. This method efficiently imposes the structural information by considering both the edge position and direction information of the anatomical prior image in ISS-PAT. It does not require image segmentation, and can be conveniently solved by a modified alternating direction of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Results: We perform simulation, tissue mimicking phantom and in vivo small animal experiments to evaluate the proposed scheme. The reconstructed PAT images showed image quality and spectral unmixing accuracy close to those obtained by non-local means based ISS-PAT, but with much shorter image reconstruction time. For a 1/6 sparse sampling rate, the average efficiency improvement is nearly 16-folds. Conclusions: The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the dTV regularization scheme for ISS-PAT. Its efficient image reconstruction performance facilitates the potential of the hardware realization and practical applications of the ISS-PAT. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

C;Hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering and multiphoton imaging for digital pathology of colonic disease;Histopathology examinations of H&E stained biopsied tissues is the golden standard for colonic diseases (e.g., polyps, adenoma, and adenocarcinoma) diagnosis. However, staining effect of sample and doctor's expertise degree may greatly influence the diagnosis results. The information provided by the H&E stained sample is also limited to the morphological and PH information and no quantative information is available. In this paper, we report the development of a unique multimodal nonlinear optical microscopy (i.e., hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (hsSRS), second-harmonic generation (SHG), third-harmonic generation (THG), two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF)) platform for the diagnosis and characterization of colonic diseases. HsSRS in both fingerprint (800-1800 cm(-1)) and high-wavenumber (2800-3600 cm(-1)) regions allows us to discriminate different constituents with tiny difference in the Raman spectra. The increase of proteins and reduction of lipids could be observed with the progress of colonic cancer. SHG shows the distribution of collagen, which is found to aggregate for adenocarcinoma. TPEF provides the cell morphological and can reflect the damage inside glands caused by the diseases. THG shows the increase of optical heterogeneity related to cancer process. This work shows that the integrated hsSRS and TPEF/SHG/THG imaging technique can be an effective method for digital pathology of colonic diseases at the molecular and sub-cellular levels.;2016;10.1117/12.2212749
C;Multispectral light source for endoscopic procedures;This paper presents the implementation of an endoscopic system with an opto-mechanical revolver for the interchange of five illumination sources for the in vivo diagnostic of abnormalities in liver tissue. Also, the system allows to save images produced by light reflection or autofluorescence. A pedal was implemented to automatically interchange the illumination sources during the endoscopic procedure. Software was developed to save the images captured by the endocamera. Fatty liver images were taken in an animal model which shows the advance of the disease.;2018;
J;In vivo F-18-FDG tumour uptake measurements in small animals using Cerenkov radiation;2-[F-18]Fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (F-18-FDG) is a widely used PET radiotracer for the in vivo diagnosis of several diseases such as tumours. The positrons emitted by F-18-FDG, travelling into tissues faster than the speed of light in the same medium, are responsible for Cerenkov radiation (CR) emission which is prevalently in the visible range. The purpose of this study is to show that CR escaping from tumour tissues of small living animals injected with F-18-FDG can be detected with optical imaging (OI) techniques using a commercial optical instrument equipped with charge-coupled detectors (CCD). The theory behind the Cerenkov light emission and the source depth measurements using CR is first presented. Mice injected with F-18-FDG or saline solution underwent dynamic OI acquisition and a comparison between images was performed. Multispectral analysis of the radiation was used to estimate the depth of the source of Cerenkov light. Small animal PET images were also acquired in order to compare the F-18-FDG bio-distribution measured using OI and PET scanner. Cerenkov in vivo whole-body images of tumour-bearing mice and the measurements of the emission spectrum (560-660 nm range) are presented. Brain, kidneys and tumour were identified as a source of visible light in the animal body: the tissue time-activity curves reflected the physiological accumulation of F-18-FDG in these organs. The identification is confirmed by the comparison between CR and F-18-FDG images. These results will allow the use of conventional OI devices for the in vivo study of glucose metabolism in cancer and the assessment, for example, of anti-cancer drugs. Moreover, this demonstrates that F-18-FDG can be employed as it is a bimodal tracer for PET and OI techniques.;2011;10.1007/s00259-010-1630-y
J;Fluorescence molecular tomography resolves protease activity in vivo;"Systematic efforts are under way to develop novel technologies that would allow molecular sensing in intact organisms in vivo. Using near-infrared fluorescent molecular beacons and inversion techniques that take into account the diffuse nature of photon propagation in tissue, we were able to obtain three-dimensional in vivo images of a protease in orthopic gliomas. We demonstrate that enzyme-activatable fluorochromes can be detected with high positional accuracy in deep tissues, that molecular specificities of different beacons towards enzymes can be resolved and that tomography of beacon activation is linearly related to enzyme concentration. The tomographic imaging method offers a range of new capabilities for studying biological function; for example, identifying molecular-expression patterns by multispectral imaging or continuously monitoring the efficacy of therapeutic drugs.";2002;10.1038/nm729
C;Evaluation of a Multispectral Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Device for Assessment of Cardiometabolic Risk Related Alterations of Body Composition;"Cardiometabolic diseases encompass a combination of conditions which lead to an increase in the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. With the increasing percentage of the population becoming overweight, it is important to diagnose when the excess adipose tissue becomes malign. The development of a safe, mobile, non-invasive method that would be easy to perform, and low-cost, but also would offer an accurate assessment of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) both in lean and in obese persons is required. A prototype device using an optical method for measurement of the SAT in vivo has been developed, it contains multiple LEDs with four wavelengths (660nm, 780nm, 870nm, 940nm) distributed at various distances from the photodetector which allow different light penetration depths into the subcutaneous tissue. Five young healthy female students participated in the study; the measurements were performed on three body sites: calf, upper and lower abdomen. The backscattered light acquired with the prototype was compared to SAT measured with high resolution ultrasound imaging. The coefficient of variation indicated high reliability of the measurements. Statistically significant (from r=0.81 to r=0.95; p<0.05) correlation between intensity of backscattered light and SAT thicknesses for all four wavelength was observed, especially at source-detector distance 25mm. The novel device prototype has a potential to be a good alternative for conventional SAT measurement and assessment of cardiometabolic risk. Amultispectral approach can potentially increase precision and spatial resolution of SAT determination.";2013;10.1117/12.2044685
J;In Vivo Dual-Modal Photoacoustic and Ultrasound Imaging of Sentinel Lymph Nodes Using a Solid-State Dye Laser System;Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is being actively investigated as a non-invasive and non-radioactive imaging technique for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. By taking advantage of optical and ultrasound imaging, PAI probes SLNs non-invasively with methylene blue (MB) in both live animals and breast cancer patients. However, these PAI systems have limitations for widespread use in clinics and commercial marketplaces because the lasers used by the PAI systems, e.g., tunable liquid dye laser systems and optical parametric oscillator (OPO) lasers, are bulky in size, not economical, and use risky flammable and toxic liquid dyes. To overcome these limitations, we are proposing a novel dual-modal photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging system based on a solid-state dye laser (SD-PAUSI), which is compact, convenient, and carries far less risk of flammability and toxicity. Using a solid-state dye handpiece that generates 650-nm wavelength, we successfully imaged the MB tube positioned deeply (similar to 3.9 cm) in chicken breast tissue. The SLNs were also photoacoustically detected in the in vivo rats beneath a 2.2-cm-thick layer of chicken breast, which is deeper than the typical depth of SLNs in humans (1.2 +/- 0.5 cm). Furthermore, we showed the multispectral capability of the PAI by switching the dye handpiece, in which the MB-dyed SLN was selectively highlighted from the surrounding vasculature. These results demonstrated the great potential of the SD-PAUSI as an easy but effective modality for SLN detection.;2020;10.3390/s20133714
J;Automated melanoma detection with a novel multispectral imaging system: results of a prospective study;The aim of this research was to evaluate the performance of anew spectroscopic system in the diagnosis of melanoma. This study involves a consecutive series of 1278 patients with 1391 cutaneous pigmented lesions including 184 melanomas. In an attempt to approach the 'real world' of lesion population, a further set of 1022 not excised clinically reassuring lesions was also considered for analysis. Each lesion was imaged in vivo by a multispectral imaging system. The system operates at wavelengths between 483 and 950 nm by acquiring 15 images at equally spaced wavelength intervals. From the images, different lesion descriptors were extracted related to the colour distribution and morphology of the lesions. Data reduction techniques were applied before setting up a neural network classifier designed to perform automated diagnosis. The data set was randomly divided into three sets: train (696 lesions, including 90 melanomas) and verify (348 lesions, including 53 melanomas) for the instruction of a proper neural network, and an independent test set (347 lesions, including 41 melanomas). The neural network was able to discriminate between melanomas and non-melanoma lesions with a sensitivity of 80.4% and a specificity of 75.6% in the 1391 histologized cases data set. No major variations were found in classification scores when train, verify and test subsets were separately evaluated. Following receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the resulting area under the curve was 0.85. No significant differences were found among areas under train, verify and test set curves, supporting the good network ability to generalize for new cases. In addition, specificity and area under ROC curve increased up to 90% and 0.90, respectively, when the additional set of 1022 lesions without histology was added to the test set. Our data show that performance of an automated system is greatly population dependent, suggesting caution in the comparison with results reported in the literature. In our opinion, scientific reports should provide, at least, the median values of thickness and dimension of melanomas, as well as the number of small (<= 6 mm) melanomas.;2005;10.1088/0031-9155/50/8/004
J;Monodisperse Au-Fe2C Janus Nanoparticles: An Attractive Multifunctional Material for Triple-Modal Imaging-Guided Tumor Photothermal Therapy;Imaging-guided photothermal therapy (PTT) by combination of imaging and PTT has been emerging as a promising therapeutic method for precision therapy. However, the development of multicomponent nanoplatforms with stable structures for both PTT and multiple-model imaging remains a great challenge. Herein, we synthesized monodisperse Au-Fe2C Janus nanoparticles (JNPs) of 12 nm, which are multifunctional entities for cancer theranostics. Due to the br,oad absorption in the near-infrared range, Au-Fe2C JNPs showed a significant photothermal effect with a 30.2% calculated photothermal transduction efficiency under 808 nm laser irradiation in vitro. Owing to their excellent optical and magnetic properties, Au-Fe2C JNPs were demonstrated to be advantageous agents for triple-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/multispectral photoacoustic tomography (MSOT)/computed tomography (CT) both in vitro and in vivo. We found that Au-Fe2C JNPs conjugated with the affibody (Au-Fe2C Z(HER2,342)) have more accumulation and deeper penetration in tumor sites than nontargeting JNPs (Au-Fe2C PEG) in vivo. Meanwhile, our results verified that Au-Fe2C-Z(HER2,342) JNPs can selectively target tumor cells with low cytotoxicity and ablate tumor tissues effectively in a mouse model. In summary, monodisperse Au-Fe2C JNPs, used as a multifunctional nanoplatform, allow the combination of multiple-model imaging techniques and high therapeutic efficacy and have great potential for precision theranostic nanomedicines.;2017;10.1021/acsnano.7b04461
J;Quantitative phase-filtered wavelength-modulated differential photoacoustic radar tumor hypoxia imaging toward early cancer detection;Overcoming the limitations of conventional linear spectroscopy used in multispectral photoacoustic imaging, wherein a linear relationship is assumed between the absorbed optical energy and the absorption spectra of the chromophore at a specific location, is crucial for obtaining accurate spatially-resolved quantitative functional information by exploiting known chromophore-specific spectral characteristics. This study introduces a non-invasive phase-filtered differential photoacoustic technique, wave-length-modulated differential photoacoustic radar (WMDPAR) imaging that addresses this issue by eliminating the effect of the unknown wavelength-dependent fluence. It employs two laser wavelengths modulated out-of-phase to significantly suppress background absorption while amplifying the difference between the two photoacoustic signals. This facilitates pre-malignant tumor identification and hypoxia monitoring, as minute changes in total hemoglobin concentration and hemoglobin oxygenation are detectable. The system can be tuned for specific applications such as cancer screening and SO2 quantification by regulating the amplitude ratio and phase shift of the signal. The WM-DPAR imaging of a head and neck carcinoma tumor grown in the thigh of a nude rat demonstrates the functional PA imaging of small animals in vivo. The PA appearance of the tumor in relation to tumor vascularity is investigated by immunohistochemistry. Phase-filtered WM-DPAR imaging is also illustrated, maximizing quantitative SO2 imaging fidelity of tissues.

J;Photoacoustic and hyperspectral dual-modality endoscope;We have developed a dual-modality endoscope composed of photoacoustic (PA) and hyperspectral imaging, capable of visualizing both structural and functional properties of bio-tissue. The endoscope's composition and scanning mechanism was described, and the feasibility of the dual-modality endoscope was verified by mimic phantom experiments. Lately, we demonstrated its endoscopic workability through in vivo experiments. The experimental results showed that the proposed herein hybrid endoscope can provide optical imaging of the surface and tomography imaging for the deeper features, and a functional oxygen saturation rate map of the same imaging area. We demonstrated optical-resolution PA imaging of vascular structures and an oxygen saturation rate map in a rabbit's rectum. It confirmed that this dual-modality endoscope can play an important role in comprehensive clinical applications. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America;2018;10.1364/OL.43.000138
J;Tumor targeted mesoporous silica-coated gold nanorods facilitate detection of pancreatic tumors using Multispectral optoacoustic tomography;Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is an emerging imaging technology that offers several advantages over traditional modalities, particularly in its ability to resolve optical contrast at depth on the microscopic scale. While potential applications include the early detection of tumors below clinical thresholds set by current technology, the lack of tumor-specific contrast agents limits the use of MSOT imaging. Therefore, we constructed highly stable nano-contrast agents by coating gold nanorods (GNRs) with either polyacrylic acid (PAA) or aminefunctionalized mesoporous silica (MS). Syndecan-1, which has been shown to target insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1-R) (upregulated in pancreatic tumors), was conjugated on the surface of PAA-coated GNRs (PAA-GNRs) or MS-coated GNRs (MS-GNRs) to create tumor-targeted nanoparticles. In vitro, tumor targeting of nanoparticles was assessed with flow cytometry. In S2VP10L cells (positive for IGF1-R), the syndecan-1 MS-GNRs (Syndecan-MS-GNRs) demonstrated an increase in OA signal, 10x, compared to syndecan-1 PAAGNRs (Syndecan-PAA-GNRs). Minimal binding was observed in MiaPaca-2 cells (negative for IGF1-R). In vivo, tumor specific targeting of Syndecan-MS-GNRs was evaluated using a murine orthotopic pancreatic cancer model. The Syndecan- MS-GNRs demonstrated significantly greater accumulation within pancreatic tumors than in off-target organs such as the liver. Mice implanted with the IGF1-R negative MiaPaca-2 cells did not demonstrate specific tumor targeting. In summary, we report that targeted nano-contrast agents (Syndecan-MS-GNRs) can successfully detect orthotopic pancreatic tumors with minimum off-target binding in vivo using MSOT.;2015;10.1007/s12274-015-0886-8
J;Complementarity of Variable-magnification and Spectral-separation Fluorescence Imaging Systems for Noninvasive Detection of Metastasis and Intravital Detection of Single Cancer Cells in Mouse Models;Imaging of tumor growth, progression and metastasis with fluorescent proteins in mouse models is a powerful technology. A limit to fluorescent-protein imaging has been for non-invasive deep-seated tumors, such as those in the lung. In the present study, the Maestro spectral-separation fluorescence imaging system and the OV100 variable-magnification imaging system were compared for noninvasive detection of metastasis in fluorescent protein-expressing orthotopic lung, liver, pancreas, and colon cancer in nude mouse tumor models, as well as for intravital single-cell imaging. Sensitivity, multispectral capability, contrast, and single cell resolution were investigated. The Maestro system outperformed the OV100 for noninvasive imaging of primary and metastatic tumors. The Maestro system detected brain tumor metastasis five days earlier than did the OV100. The Maestro had greater depth of detection compared with the OV100. By separating skin and food autofluorescence, the Maestro provided high-contrast images. The Maestro system was able to produce composite images with more unmixed components and detected more different color signals simultaneously than did the OV100. However, the OV100 system had higher resolution and was able to detect single cells in vivo unlike the Maestro. The present study demonstrates that the two instruments are complementary for imaging of all stages of cancer in mice, including single-cell trafficking and the superiority of in vivo fluorescent-protein imaging over luciferase imaging.;2015;
J;Cell-based and in vivo spectral analysis of fluorescent proteins for multiphoton microscopy;Multiphoton microscopy of cells and subcellular structures labeled with fluorescent proteins is the state-of-the-art technology for longitudinal imaging studies in tissues and living animals. Successful analysis of separate cell populations or signaling events by intravital microscopy requires optimal pairing of multiphoton excitation wavelengths with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. While prior studies have analyzed two photon absorption properties of isolated fluorescent proteins, there is limited information about two photon excitation and fluorescence emission profiles of fluorescent proteins expressed in living cells and intact tissues. Multiphoton microscopy was used to analyze fluorescence outputs of multiple blue, green, and red fluorescent proteins in cultured cells and orthotopic tumor xenografts of human breast cancer cells. It is shown that commonly used orange and red fluorescent proteins are excited efficiently by 750 to 760 nm laser light in living cells, enabling dual color imaging studies with blue or cyan proteins without changing excitation wavelength. It is also shown that small incremental changes in excitation wavelength significantly affect emission intensities from fluorescent proteins, which can be used to optimize multi-color imaging using a single laser wavelength. These data will direct optimal selection of fluorescent proteins for multispectral two photon microscopy. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

C;Image-guided plasma therapy of cutaneous wound;The wound healing process involves the reparative phases of inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Interrupting any of these phases may result in chronically unhealed wounds, amputation, or even patient death. Despite the clinical significance in chronic wound management, no effective methods have been developed for quantitative image-guided treatment. We integrated a multimodal imaging system with a cold atmospheric plasma probe for image-guided treatment of chronic wound. Multimodal imaging system offers a non-invasive, painless, simultaneous and quantitative assessment of cutaneous wound healing. Cold atmospheric plasma accelerates the wound healing process through many mechanisms including decontamination, coagulation and stimulation of the wound healing. The therapeutic effect of cold atmospheric plasma is studied in vivo under the guidance of a multimodal imaging system. Cutaneous wounds are created on the dorsal skin of the nude mice. During the healing process, the sample wound is treated by cold atmospheric plasma at different controlled dosage, while the control wound is healed naturally. The multimodal imaging system integrating a multispectral imaging module and a laser speckle imaging module is used to collect the information of cutaneous tissue oxygenation (i.e. oxygen saturation, StO(2)) and blood perfusion simultaneously to assess and guide the plasma therapy. Our preliminary tests show that cold atmospheric plasma in combination with multimodal imaging guidance has the potential to facilitate the healing of chronic wounds.;2014;10.1117/12.2041092
C;Measurement of stimulated irradiation in multispectral photometry;Calibration methods of photometric spectral selection channels of biomedical in vivo photometer-spectrum analyzer which allow to measure absolute value of light fluxes at luminescence wave-length band (0.66 - 0.9 mu m) during probe by wave-length 0.66 mu m are presented. Three experimental calibration schemes for photometric channel are designed. Each channel consists of narrowband light filter, high sensitive pin-photoreceiver, amplifier block and ADC. Advantages and shortcomings of every scheme are discussed. Measurements of complete flux of fight back scattered by the investigated sample and spectral analysis of this irradiation allow analyzing experimental data at quantitative level.

Tissues of volunteers belonging to different age with various diseases were investigated.;2005;10.1117/12.610524
J;Building Biological Flashlights: Orthogonal Luciferases and Luciferins for in Vivo Imaging;CONSPECTUS: Bioluminescence is widely used for real-time imaging in living organisms. This technology features a light-emitting reaction between enzymes (luciferases) and small molecule substrates (luciferins). Photons produced from luciferase-luciferin reactions can penetrate through heterogeneous tissue, enabling readouts of physiological processes. Dozens of bioluminescent probes are now available and many are routinely used to monitor cell proliferation, migration, and gene expression patterns in vivo. Despite the ubiquity of bioluminescence, traditional applications have been largely limited to imaging one biological feature at a time. Only a handful of luciferase-luciferin pairs can be easily used in tandem, and most are poorly resolved in living animals. Efforts to develop spectrally distinct reporters have been successful, but multispectral imaging in large organisms remains a formidable challenge due to interference from surrounding tissue. Consequently, a lack of well-resolved probes has precluded multicomponent tracking. An expanded collection of bioluminescent probes would provide insight into processes where multiple cell types drive physiological tasks, including immune function and organ development. We aimed to expand the bioluminescent toolkit by developing substrate-resolved imaging agents. The goal was to generate multiple orthogonal (i.e., noncross-reactive) luciferases that are responsive to unique scaffolds and could be used concurrently in living animals. We adopted a parallel engineering approach to genetically modify luciferases to accept chemically modified luciferins. When the mutants and analogs are combined, light is produced only when complementary enzyme-substrate partners interact. Thus, the pairs can be distinguished based on substrate selectivity, regardless of the color of light emitted. Sequential administration of the luciferins enables the unique luciferases to be illuminated (and thus resolved) within complex environments, including whole organisms. This Account describes our efforts to develop orthogonal bioluminescent probes, crafting custom luciferases (or biological flashlights) that can selectively process luciferin analogs (or batteries) to produce light. In the first section, we describe synthetic methods that were key to accessing diverse luciferin architectures. The second section focuses on identifying complementary luciferase enzymes via a combination of mutagenesis and screening. To expedite the search for orthogonal enzymes and substrates, we developed a computational algorithm to sift through large data sets. The third section features examples of the parallel engineering approach. We identified orthogonal enzyme-substrate pairs comprising two different classes of luciferins. The probes were vetted both in cells and whole organisms. This expanded collection of imaging agents is applicable to studies of immune function and other multicomponent processes. The final section of the Account highlights ongoing work toward building better bioluminescent tools. As ever-brighter and more selective probes are developed, the frontiers of what we can see in vivo will continue to expand.;2019;10.1021/acs.accounts.9b00391
J;Hyperspectral imaging system in the delineation of Ill-defined basal cell carcinomas: a pilot study;Background Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common skin cancer in the Caucasian population. Eighty per cent of BCCs are located on the head and neck area. Clinically ill-defined BCCs often represent histologically aggressive subtypes, and they can have subtle subclinical extensions leading to recurrence and the need for re-excisions. Objectives The aim of this pilot study was to test the feasibility of a hyperspectral imaging system (HIS) in vivo in delineating the preoperatively lateral margins of ill-defined BCCs on the head and neck area. Methods Ill-defined BCCs were assessed clinically with a dermatoscope, photographed and imaged with HIS. This was followed by surgical procedures where the BCCs were excised at the clinical border and the marginal strip separately. HIS, with a 12-cm(2) field of view and fast data processing, records a hyperspectral graph for every pixel in the imaged area, thus creating a data cube. With automated computational modelling, the spectral data are converted into localization maps showing the tumour borders. Interpretation of these maps was compared to the histologically verified tumour borders. Results Sixteen BCCs were included. Of these cases, 10 of 16 were the aggressive subtype of BCC and 6 of 16 were nodular, superficial or a mixed type. HIS delineated the lesions more accurately in 12 of 16 of the BCCs compared to the clinical evaluation (4 of 16 wider and 8 of 16 smaller by HIS). In 2 of 16 cases, the HIS-delineated lesion was wider without histopathological confirmation. In 2 of 16 cases, HIS did not detect the histopathologically confirmed subclinical extension. Conclusions HIS has the potential to be an easy and fast aid in the preoperative delineation of ill-defined BCCs, but further adjustment and larger studies are warranted for an optimal outcome.;2019;10.1111/jdv.15102
J;Slit-scanning Raman microscopy: Instrumentation and applications for molecular imaging of cell and tissue;In recent years, Raman microscopy has emerged as a molecular imaging tool for cell and tissue analysis. A key reason for this is the development of techniques that significantly increase imaging speed. In this Tutorial, we introduce slit-scanning Raman microscopy, a Raman imaging technique that achieves imaging speeds more than two orders of magnitude faster than conventional confocal Raman microscopy, and its application to cell and tissue imaging and analysis. Recent advances in Raman imaging, particularly further improvements in imaging speed, sensitivity, specificity, and spatial resolution, are also discussed. In addition, we present the prospects of Raman microscopy as a molecular imaging method to aid in new discoveries in life sciences and the potential of high-speed Raman imaging for clinical applications.

J;Intraoperative Optical Monitoring of Spinal Cord Hemodynamics Using Multiwavelength Imaging System;The spinal cord is a major structure of the central nervous system allowing, among other things, the transmission of afferent sensory and efferent motor information. During spinal surgery, such as scoliosis correction, this structure can be damaged, resulting in major neurological damage to the patient. To date, there is no direct way to monitor the oxygenation of the spinal cord intraoperatively to reflect its vitality. This is essential information that would allow surgeons to adapt their procedure in case of ischemic suffering of the spinal cord. We report the development of a specific device to monitor the functional status of biological tissues with high resolution. The device, operating with multiple wavelengths, uses Near-InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) in combination with other additional sensors, including ElectroNeuroGraphy (ENG). In this paper, we focused primarily on aspects of the PhotoPlethysmoGram (PPG), emanating from four different light sources to show in real time and record biological signals from the spinal cord in transmission and reflection modes. This multispectral system was successfully tested in in vivo experiments on the spinal cord of a pig for specific medical applications.;2022;10.3390/s22103840
J;Simulated Annealing-Based Wavelength Selection for Robust Tissue Oxygenation Estimation Powered by the Extended Modified Lambert-Beer Law;In this paper, we present a set of algorithms to enable the development of inexpensive hyperspectral sensors capable of estimating tissue oxygenation for wound monitoring. Estimation is conducted using the extended modified Lambert-Beer law, which has previously been proven robust to differences in melanin concentration. We introduce a novel wavelength selection algorithm that enables the estimation to be performed with high accuracy using only a small number (5-10) of wavelengths. Validation performed with Monte Carlo simulation data resulted in prediction errors <1%, with no significant differences among various skin types, for as few as five wavelengths under conditions representing both high precision instrumentation and more cost-effective sensors designed with inexpensive LEDs and/or filters. Validation with in vivo data collected from an occlusion study with 13 Asian volunteers showed statistically significant separation between the estimates for the at-rest and arterial occlusion states. Additional stability testing proved the proposed algorithms to be robust to small changes in the selected wavelengths as may occur in a real LED due to manufacturing tolerances and temperature fluctuations. This work concluded that the development of an inexpensive hyperspectral device for wound monitoring in all skin types is feasible using just a small number of wavelengths.;2022;10.3390/app12178490
C;Cytomics in regenerative medicine;Cytomics is the high-content analysis of cell-systems [6, 78]. The area of Cytomics and Systems Biology received great attention during the last years as it harbours the promise to substantially impact on various fields of biomedicine, drug discovery, predictive medicine [6] and may have major potential for regenerative medicine. In regenerative medicine Cytomics includes process control of cell preparation and culturing using non-invasive detection techniques, quality control and standardization for GMP and GLP conformity and even prediction of cell fate based on sophisticated data analysis. Cytomics requires quantitative and stoichiometric single cell analysis. In some areas the leading cytometric techniques represent the cutting edge today. Many different applications/variations of multicolour staining were developed for flow- or slide-based cytometry (SBC) analysis of suspensions and sections to whole animal analysis [78]. SBC has become an important analytical technology in drug discovery, diagnosis and research and is an emerging technology for systems analysis [78]. It enables high-content high-throughput measurement of cell suspensions, cell cultures and tissues. In the last years various commercial SBC instruments were launched principally enabling to perform similar tasks. Standardisation as well as comparability of different instruments is a major challenge. Hyperspectral optical imaging may be implemented in SBC analysis for label free cell detection based on cellular autofluorescence [3]. All of these developments push the systemic approach of the analysis of biological specimens to enhance the outcome of regenerative medicine.;2008;10.1117/12.761495
J;Multispectral scanning time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy (TRFS) technique for intravascular diagnosis;"This study describes a scanning time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy (TRFS) system designed to continuously acquire fluorescence emission and to reconstruct fluorescence lifetime images (FLIM) from a luminal surface by using a catheter-based optical probe with rotary joint and pull-back device. The ability of the system to temporally and spectrally resolve the fluorescence emission from tissue was validated using standard dyes and tissue phantoms (e.g., ex vivo pig aorta phantom). Current results demonstrate that this system is capable to reliably resolve the fluorescence emission of multiple fluorophores located in the lumen; and suggest its potential for intravascular detection of distinct biochemical features of atherosclerotic plaques.

J;The in vivo fate of nanoparticles and nanoparticle-loaded microcapsules after oral administration in mice: Evaluation of their potential for colon-specific delivery;Anti-cancer drug loaded-nanoparticles (NPs) or encapsulation of NPs in colon-targeted delivery systems shows potential for increasing the local drug concentration in the colon leading to improved treatment of colorectal cancer. To investigate the potential of the NP-based strategies for colon-specific delivery, two formulations, free Eudragit (R) NPs and enteric-coated NP-loaded chitosan hypromellose microcapsules (MCs) were fluorescently-labelled and their tissue distribution in mice after oral administration was monitored by multispectral small animal imaging. The free NPs showed a shorter transit time throughout the mouse digestive tract than the MCs, with extensive excretion of NPs in faeces at 5 h. Conversely, the MCs showed complete NP release in the lower region of the mouse small intestine at 8 h post-administration. Overall, the encapsulation of NPs in MCs resulted in a higher colonic NP intensity from 8 h to 24 h post-administration compared to the free NPs, due to a NP 'guarding' effect of MCs during their transit along mouse gastrointestinal tract which decreased NP excretion in faeces. These imaging data revealed that this widely-utilised colon-targeting MC formulation lacked site-precision for releasing its NP load in the colon, but the increased residence time of the NPs in the lower gastrointestinal tract suggests that it is still useful for localised release of chemotherapeutics, compared to NP administration alone. In addition, both formulations resided in the stomach of mice at considerable concentrations over 24 h. Thus, adhesion of NP- or MC-based oral delivery systems to gastric mucosa may be problematic for colon-specific delivery of the cargo to the colon and should be carefully investigated for a full evaluation of particulate delivery systems.

J;Emerging Technologies to Image Tissue Metabolism;Due to the implication of altered metabolism in a large spectrum of tissue function and disease, assessment of metabolic processes becomes essential in managing health. In this regard, imaging can play a critical role in allowing observation of biochemical and physiological processes. Nuclear imaging methods, in particular positron emission tomography, have been widely employed for imaging metabolism but are mainly limited by the use of ionizing radiation and the sensing of only one parameter at each scanning session. Observations in healthy individuals or longitudinal studies of disease could markedly benefit from non-ionizing, multi-parameter imaging methods. We therefore focus this review on progress with the non-ionizing radiation methods of MRI, hyperpolarized magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, chemical exchange saturation transfer, and emerging optoacoustic (photoacoustic) imaging. We also briefly discuss the role of nuclear and optical imaging methods for research and clinical protocols.;2019;10.1016/j.cmet.2018.09.004
J;Detection of collagen by multi-wavelength photoacoustic analysis as a biomarker for bone health assessment;Collagen is an important biomarker of osteoporosis progression. Noninvasive, multispectral, photoacoustic (PA) techniques use pulsed laser light to induce PA signals to facilitate the visualization of chemical components that are strongly related to tissue health. In this study, the feasibility of multi-wavelength PA (MWPA) measurement of the collagen in bone, using the wavelength range of 1300-1800 nm, was investigated. First, the feasibility of this approach for detecting the collagen content of bone was demonstrated by means of numerical simulation. Then, ex vivo experiments were conducted on both animal and human bone specimens with different bone densities using the MWPA method. The relative collagen content was extracted and compared with the results of micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histology. The results showed that the relative collagen content parameter obtained using the MWPA approach correlated well with the bone volume ratio obtained from microCT images and histological analysis results. This study highlights the potential of the proposed PA technique for determining the collagen content of bones as a biomarker for bone health assessment.;2021;10.1016/j.pacs.2021.100296
C;Multi-spectral Scanning Fiber Endoscope with concurrent autofluorescence mitigation for enhanced target-to-background ratio imaging;We developed a multispectral fluorescence-reflectance scanning fiber endoscope (SFE) for wide-field molecular imaging of fluorescence-labeled molecular probes. Concurrent multi-channels imaging with the wide-field SFE also allows for real-time mitigation of background autofluorescence (AF) signal, especially when the FDA approved fluorescein is used as the target fluorophore. In the current study, we demonstrated a real-time AF mitigation algorithm on a tissue phantom which featured molecular probe targeted cells of high grade dysplasia on a substrate containing AF species. The target-to-background ratio was enhanced by over an order of magnitude when applying the real-time AF mitigation algorithm. By minimizing the background signal, multispectral fluorescence imaging can provide sufficient image contrast and quantitative target information for detecting small pre-cancerous lesions in vivo.;2014;10.1117/12.2038553
J;Phthalocyanine photosensitizers as contrast agents for in vivo photoacoustic tumor imaging;There is a need for contrast agents for non-invasive diagnostic imaging of tumors. Herein, Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) was employed to evaluate phthalocyanines commonly used in photodynamic therapy as photoacoustic contrast agents. We studied the photoacoustic activity of three water-soluble phthalocyanine photosensitizers: phthalocyanine tetrasulfonic acid (PcS4), Zn(II) phthalocyanine tetrasulfonic acid (ZnPcS4) and Al(III) phthalocyanine chloride tetrasulfonic acid (AlPcS4) in phantom and in tumor-bearing mice to investigate the biodistribution and fate of the phthalocyanines in the biological tissues. PcS4 was observed to grant good contrast between the different reticuloendothelial organs and accumulate in the tumor within an hour of post-administration. ZnPcS4 and AlPcS4 offered little contrast in photoacoustic signals between the organs. PcS4 is a promising photoacoustic contrast agent and can be exploited as a photodiagnostic agent.

J;The world of light in diagnostic medicine. Current developments in optical imaging;Optical imaging has always played a central role in the elucidation of biological and physiological mechanisms in modern biology and medicine. Based on the good experiences in light microscopy, sophisticated meso- and macroscopic optical imaging systems have recently been created. All optical imaging methods are characterized by high user-friendliness and sensitivity, they are associated with relatively low costs and do not require any radioactivity. Its clinical performance is seen in the intraoperative imaging of the tissue area to be removed and in the radiotracer-free diagnosis of diseases in body areas with good accessibility to light. From a pathomorphological point of view, the focus was particularly on the depiction of tumors and inflammation. Imaging detection of fluorescent dyes with emission characteristics in the near-infrared range of the spectrum is favorable in terms of a good signal-to-background ratio and improved information acquisition from greater tissue depths. A major challenge, however, is the diverse photon interactions with the tissue. Previous research and development work has produced various in vivo optical imaging methods, some of which are still in the experimental stage (e.g., fluorescence-mediated tomography, multispectral in vivo imaging, bioluminescence imaging, Raman spectroscopy), while others already havemade their way into the clinical setting (e.g., fluorescence reflection imaging, optoacoustic imaging). The most important optical methods are presented in this review article.;2022;10.1007/s00117-022-01007-5
C;Confocal microendoscope for use in OB/GYN applications;A 3 mm catheter-based fluorescence confocal microscope has been developed for in vivo use. The catheter in this system fits through the therapeutic channel of a commercial endoscope. The catheter consists of a coherent fiber-optic imaging bundle, a miniature objective. and a focusing mechanism. The proximal end of the catheter is coupled to a slit-scan confocal microscope. Real-time images can be obtained of fluorescing tissue microstructures. The optical performance of the microendoscope is limited by the characteristics of the fiber bundle. The lateral resolution is 1.8 mu m and the axial resolution is 25 mu m. The field of view is 430 mu m. The maximum imaging depth is 200 mu m. The confocal microscope operates in both grayscale and multispectral modes. Images have been obtained of in vivo animal models and ex vivo human models. A portable confocal microscope system is under development for in vivo clinical evaluation.;2004;
J;Recent advances in ophthalmic molecular imaging;The aim of molecular imaging techniques is the visualization of molecular processes and functional changes in living animals and human patients before morphological changes occur at the cellular and tissue level. Ophthalmic molecular imaging is still in its infancy and has mainly been used in small animals for pre-clinical research. The goal of most of these pre-clinical studies is their translation into ophthalmic molecular imaging techniques in clinical care. We discuss various molecular imaging techniques and their applications in ophthalmology. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.;2014;10.1016/j.survophthal.2013.09.005
J;A novel approach for studies of multispectral bioluminescence tomography;Bioluminescence tomography (BLT) is a promising new area in biomedical imaging. The goal of BLT is to provide quantitative reconstruction of bioluminescent source distribution within a small animal from optical signals on the animal's body surface. The multispectral version of BLT takes advantage of the measurement information in different spectrum bands. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the multispectral BLT. The new feature of the mathematical framework is to use numerical prediction results based on two related but distinct boundary value problems. This mathematical framework includes the conventional framework in the study of multispectral BLT. For the new framework introduced here, we establish the solution existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence on data, and characterize the limiting behaviors when the regularization parameter approaches zero or when the penalty parameter approaches infinity. We study two kinds of numerical schemes for multispectral BLT and derive error estimates for the numerical solutions. We also present numerical examples to show the performance of the numerical methods.;2010;10.1007/s00211-010-0293-8
J;Photoacoustic imaging in the second near-infrared window: a review;Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is an emerging medical imaging modality that combines optical excitation and ultrasound detection. Because ultrasound scatters much less than light in biological tissues, PA generates high-resolution images at centimeters depth. In recent years, wavelengths in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window (1000 to 1700 nm) have been increasingly explored due to its potential for preclinical and clinical applications. In contrast to the conventional PA imaging in the visible (400 to 700 nm) and the first NIR-I (700 to 1000 nm) window, PA imaging in the NIR-II window offers numerous advantages, including high spatial resolution, deeper penetration depth, reduced optical absorption, and tissue scattering. Moreover, the second window allows a fivefold higher light excitation energy density compared to the visible window for enhancing the imaging depth significantly. We highlight the importance of the second window for PA imaging and discuss the various NIR-II PA imaging systems and contrast agents with strong absorption in the NIR-II spectral region. Numerous applications of NIR-II PA imaging, including whole-body animal imaging and human imaging, are also discussed. (C) The Authors.

J;Quantitation of Intra-peritoneal Ovarian Cancer Metastasis;Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancy in the United States. Mortality is due to diagnosis of 75% of women with late stage disease, when metastasis is already present. EOC is characterized by diffuse and widely disseminated intra-peritoneal metastasis. Cells shed from the primary tumor anchor in the mesothelium that lines the peritoneal cavity as well as in the omentum, resulting in multi-focal metastasis, often in the presence of peritoneal ascites. Efforts in our laboratory are directed at a more detailed understanding of factors that regulate EOC metastatic success. However, quantifying metastatic tumor burden represents a significant technical challenge due to the large number, small size and broad distribution of lesions throughout the peritoneum. Herein we describe a method for analysis of EOC metastasis using cells labeled with red fluorescent protein (RFP) coupled with in vivo multispectral imaging. Following intraperitoneal injection of RFP-labelled tumor cells, mice are imaged weekly until time of sacrifice. At this time, the peritoneal cavity is surgically exposed and organs are imaged in situ. Dissected organs are then placed on a labeled transparent template and imaged ex vivo. Removal of tissue auto-fluorescence during image processing using multispectral unmixing enables accurate quantitation of relative tumor burden. This method has utility in a variety of applications including therapeutic studies to evaluate compounds that may inhibit metastasis and thereby improve overall survival.;2016;10.3791/53316
J;Orthotopic pancreatic tumors detected by optoacoustic tomography using Syndecan-1;"Background: Advances in small animal imaging have improved the detection and monitoring of cancer in vivo; although with orthotopic models, precise localization of tumors remains a challenge. In this study, we evaluated multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) as an imaging modality to detect pancreatic adenocarcinoma in an orthotopic murine model. Methods: In vitro binding of Syndecan-1 probe to the human pancreatic cancer cell line S2VP10 was evaluated on flow cytometry. For in vivo testing, S2VP10 cells were orthotopically implanted into the pancreas of severe combined immunodeficiency mice. At 7 d after implantation, the mice were intravenously injected with Syndecan-1 probe, and tumor uptake was evaluated with MSOT at multiple time points. Comparison was made with a free-dye control, indocyanine green (ICG). Probe uptake was verified ex vivo with fluorescent imaging. Results: Syndecan-1 probe demonstrated partial binding to S2VP10 cells in vitro. In vivo, Syndecan-1 probe preferentially accumulated in the pancreas tumor (480 MSOT a.u.) compared with off-target organs, including the liver (67 MSOT a.u.) and kidney (96 MSOT a.u.). Syndecan-1 probe accumulation peaked at 6 h (480 MSOT a.u.), whereas the ICG control dye failed to demonstrate similar retention within the tumor bed (0.0003 MSOT a. u.). At peak accumulation, signal intensity was 480 MSOT a. u., resulting in several times greater signal in the tumor bed than in the kidney or liver. Ex vivo fluorescent imaging comparing tumor signal with that within off-target organs confirmed the in vivo results. Conclusions: MSOT demonstrates successful accumulation of Syndecan-1 probe within pancreatic tumors, and provides high-resolution images, which allow noninvasive, realtime comparison of signal within individual organs. Syndecan-1 probe preferentially accumulates within a pancreatic adenocarcinoma model, with minimal off-target effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.";2015;10.1016/j.jss.2014.06.045

J;Fluorescent labeling of chitosan for use in non-invasive monitoring of degradation in tissue engineering;The establishment of non-invasive analytical tools for assessing the in-situ use of biomaterials for surgical implants or scaffolds in tissue engineering and polymer-based therapies is fundamental. This study established a method for fluorescent tracking of the degradation of a chitosan membrane scaffold for use in vitro in bioreactors and ultimately in vivo. The basis of this tracking system is a fluorescence emitting biomaterial obtained by covalent binding of the fluorophore tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) onto the backbone of chitosan. Using confocal microscopy, this study quantitated the reductions in fluorescence intensity of the membrane and correlated these decreases with weight loss during polymer breakdown, thereby providing a technique for non-destructively assessing the extent of degradation of chitosan materials over time in vitro. Using multispectral imaging in a mouse model, the study assessed the degradation profile of the fluorophore-labeled biomaterial in vivo in real time and identified the dispersing pathway of the chitosan membrane degradation products in vivo. The results revealed that TRITC conjugated chitosan was biocompatible and supported bone cell growth. The changes in fluorescence intensity correlated well with weight loss up to 16 weeks of in vitro culture and could be monitored over two weeks in vivo.

C;Image-guided photoacoustic spectroscopy in diagnosis of osteoarthritis in hands: an initial study;We present for the first time in vivo experimental evidence that multispectral quantitative photoacoustic tomography (qPAT) has the potential to detect osteoarthritis (OA) in the finger joints. In this pilot study, 2 OA patients and 4 healthy volunteers were enrolled, and their distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints were examined photoacoustically by a multispectral PAT scanner. Images of tissue physiological/functional parameters including oxy-hemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, oxygen saturation and water content along with tissue acoustic velocity of all the examined joints were simultaneously recovered using a finite element reconstruction algorithm for multispectral photoacoustic measurements. The recovered multispectral photoacoustic images show that the OA joints have significantly elevated water content, decreased oxygen saturation, and increased acoustic velocity compared to the normal joints.;2011;10.1117/12.879439
J;Comprehensive Assessment of High-Risk Plaques by Dual-Modal Imaging Catheter in Coronary Artery;"Coronary plaque destabilization involves alterations in microstructure and biochemical composition; however, no imaging approach allows such comprehensive characterization. Herein, the authors demonstrated a simultaneous microstructural and biochemical assessment of high-risk plaques in the coronary arteries in a beating heart using a fully integrated optical coherence tomography and fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm). It was found that plaque components such as lipids, macrophages, lipids+macrophages, and fibrotic tissues had unique fluorescence lifetime signatures that were distinguishable using multispectral FLIm. Because FLIm yielded massive biochemical readouts, the authors incorporated machine learning framework into FLIm, and ultimately, their approach enabled an automated, quantitative imaging of multiple key components relevant for plaque destabilization.

J;Reporter gene-based optoacoustic imaging of E. coli targeted colon cancer in vivo;Bacteria-mediated cancer-targeted therapy is a novel experimental strategy for the treatment of cancers. Bacteria can be engineered to overcome a major challenge of existing therapeutics by differentiating between malignant and healthy tissue. A prerequisite for further development and study of engineered bacteria is a suitable imaging concept which allows bacterial visualization in tissue and monitoring bacterial targeting and proliferation. Optoacoustics (OA) is an evolving technology allowing whole-tumor imaging and thereby direct observation of bacterial colonization in tumor regions. However, bacterial detection using OA is currently hampered by the lack of endogenous contrast or suitable transgene fluorescent labels. Here, we demonstrate improved visualization of cancer-targeting bacteria using OA imaging and E. coli engineered to express tyrosinase, which uses L-tyrosine as the substrate to produce the strong optoacoustic probe melanin in the tumor microenvironment. Tumors of animals injected with tyrosinase-expressing E. coli showed strong melanin signals, allowing to resolve bacterial growth in the tumor over time using multispectral OA tomography (MSOT). MSOT imaging of melanin accumulation in tumors was confirmed by melanin and E. coli staining. Our results demonstrate that using tyrosinase-expressing E. coli enables non-invasive, longitudinal monitoring of bacterial targeting and proliferation in cancer using MSOT.;2021;10.1038/s41598-021-04047-4
J;Oxygen saturation measurements of the retinal vasculature in treated asymmetrical primary open-angle glaucoma using hyperspectral imaging;"Purpose To determine whether there are differences in retinal vascular oxygen saturation measurements, estimated using a hyperspectral fundus camera, between normal eyes and treated eyes of subjects with asymmetrical primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Methods A noninvasive hyperspectral fundus camera was used to acquire spectral images of the retina at wavelengths between 556 and 650nm in 2-nm increments. In total, 14 normal eyes and both eyes of 11 treated POAG subjects were imaged and analyzed using algorithms that use the spectral variation of the optical densities of blood vessels to estimate the oxygen saturation of blood within the retinal vasculature. In the treated POAG group, each of the eyes were categorized, based on the mean deviation of the Humphrey visual-field analyzer result, as either more-advanced or less-advanced, glaucomatous eyes. Unpaired t-tests (two-tailed) with Welch's correction were used to compare the mean oxygen saturation between the normal subjects and the treated POAG subgroups. Results In less-advanced and more-advanced-treated POAG eyes, mean retinal venular oxygen saturations (48.2 +/- 21.6% and 42.6 +/- 18.8%, respectively) were significantly higher than in normal eyes (27.9 +/- 9.9%; P= 0.03 and 0.01, respectively). Arteriolar oxygen saturation was not significantly different between normal eyes and treated POAG eyes. Conclusions The increased oxygen saturation of the retinal venules in advanced-treated POAG eyes may indicate reduced metabolic consumption of oxygen in the inner retinal tissues.";2014;10.1038/eye.2014.169
C;Multispectral Autofluorescence Detection of Skin Neoplasia Using Steady-state Techniques;"In the current study were used excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS) steady-state techniques in a broad spectral regions (excitation at 220-500 nm and emission at 280-850 nm) to achieve the whole set of endogenous fluorophores, existed in normal and neoplastic cutaneous tissues. Several types of benign, dysplastic and malignant types of skin lesions were investigated ex vivo using both EEM and SFS modalities, namely the basal cell papilloma and carcinoma, pigmented nevi, dysplastic nevi, squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma. Histological analysis was used as a gold standard for evaluation of clinical diagnosis of the lesions investigated. Comparison with the normal skin tissue spectral data was made, based on the signals detected from the safety margins areas of the surgically excised tumours. EEM and SFS data reveal statistically significant differences between variety of benign, dysplastic and malignant lesions, which could be used as fingerprints, applicable for differentiation algorithms. In a few of malignancies endogenous porphyrins signals were even observed, but in general the fluorescence signals were addressed to the coenzymes, such as NADH, flavins; structural proteins, such as collagen, elastin and their cross-links, as well as keratin in the case of basal cell lesions. Pigments, such as hemoglobin and melanin distorted the signal due to intrinsic fluorophores signal reabsorption, what has to be taken into account when the algorithms for discrimination of the pathology types are developed.";2019;10.1117/12.2516337
J;Noninvasive real-time characterization of non-melanoma skin cancers with handheld optoacoustic probes;Currently, imaging technologies that enable dermsurgeons to visualize non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) in vivo preoperatively are lacking, resulting in excessive or incomplete removal. Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is a volumetric imaging tool to differentiate tissue chromophores and exogenous contrast agents, based on differences in their spectral signatures and used for high-resolution imaging of functional and molecular contrast at centimeter scale depth. We performed MSOT imaging with two-and three-dimensional handheld scanners on 21 Asian patients with NMSC. The tumors and their oxygenation parameters could be distinguished from normal skin endogenously. The lesion dimensions and depths were extracted from the spectral melanin component with three-dimensional spatial resolution up to 80 mm. The intraclass correlation coefficient correlating tumor dimension measurements between MSOT and ex vivo histology of excised tumors, showed good correlation. Realtime 3D imaging was found to provide information on lesion morphology and its underlying neovasculature, indicators of the tumor's aggressiveness. (C) 2017 The Authors.

J;Through-needle all-optical ultrasound imaging in vivo: a preclinical swine study;"High-frequency ultrasound imaging can provide exquisite visualizations of tissue to guide minimally invasive procedures. Here, we demonstrate that an all-optical ultrasound transducer, through which light guided by optical fibers is used to generate and receive ultrasound, is suitable for real-time invasive medical imaging in vivo. Broad-bandwidth ultrasound generation was achieved through the photoacoustic excitation of a multiwalled carbon nanotube-polydimethylsiloxane composite coating on the distal end of a 300-mu m multi-mode optical fiber by a pulsed laser. The interrogation of a high-finesse Fabry-Perot cavity on a single-mode optical fiber by a wavelength-tunable continuous-wave laser was applied for ultrasound reception. This transducer was integrated within a custom inner transseptal needle (diameter 1.08 mm; length 78 cm) that included a metallic septum to acoustically isolate the two optical fibers. The use of this needle within the beating heart of a pig provided unprecedented real-time views (50 Hz scan rate) of cardiac tissue (depth: 2.5 cm; axial resolution: 64 mu m) and revealed the critical anatomical structures required to safely perform a transseptal crossing: the right and left atrial walls, the right atrial appendage, and the limbus fossae ovalis. This new paradigm will allow ultrasound imaging to be integrated into a broad range of minimally invasive devices in different clinical contexts.";2017;10.1038/lsa.2017.103
J;Multispectral diffuse optical tomography with absorption and scattering spectral constraints;We present a new method to simultaneously reconstruct the images of oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, and water concentrations, as well as the volume fraction images of the scattering particles using continuous wave multispectral diffuse optical tomography with the absorption and scattering spectral prior constraints. In this method, the nonlinear relationship between the reduced scattering coefficient and the volume fraction and the size of the particles is linearized, allowing direct reconstruction of the volume fraction of scattering particles in tissues. The method is validated by a series of numerical simulations, phantom experiments, and in vivo clinical experiments. The initial clinical results indicate that the volume fraction of scattering particles in a malignant tumor is higher than that in a benign tumor.

J;Assessment of angle-dependent spectral distortion to develop accurate hyperspectral endoscopy;Hyperspectral endoscopy has shown its potential to improve disease diagnosis in gastrointestinal tracts. Recent approaches in developing hyperspectral endoscopy are mainly focusing on enhancing image speed and quality of spectral information under a clinical environment, but there are many issues in obtaining consistent spectral information due to complicated imaging conditions, including imaging angle, non-uniform illumination, working distance, and low reflected signal. We quantitatively investigated the effect of imaging angle on the distortion of spectral information by exploiting a bifurcated fiber, spectrometer, and tissue-mimicking phantom. Spectral distortion becomes severe as increasing the angle of the imaging fiber or shortening camera exposure time for fast image acquisition. Moreover, spectral ranges from 450 to 550 nm are more susceptible to the angle-dependent spectral distortion than longer spectral ranges. Therefore, imaging angles close to normal and longer target spectral ranges with enough detector exposure time could minimize spectral distortion in hyperspectral endoscopy. These findings will help implement clinical HSI endoscopy for the robust and accurate measurement of spectral information from patients in vivo.;2022;10.1038/s41598-022-16232-0
J;In vivo spatial frequency domain spectroscopy of two layer media;Monitoring of tissue blood volume and local oxygen saturation can inform the assessment of tissue health, healing, and dysfunction. These quantities can be estimated from the contribution of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin to the absorption spectrum of the dermis. However, estimation of blood related absorption in skin can be confounded by the strong absorption of melanin in the epidermis and epidermal thickness and pigmentation varies with anatomic location, race, gender, and degree of disease progression. Therefore, a method is desired that decouples the effect of melanin absorption in the epidermis from blood absorption in the dermis for a large range of skin types and thicknesses. A previously developed inverse method based on a neural network forward model was applied to simulated spatial frequency domain reflectance of skin for multiple wavelengths in the near infrared. It is demonstrated that the optical thickness of the epidermis and absorption and reduced scattering coefficients of the dermis can be determined independently and with minimal coupling. Then, the same inverse method was applied to reflectance measurements from a tissue simulating phantom and in vivo human skin. Oxygen saturation and total hemoglobin concentrations were estimated from the volar forearms of weakly and strongly pigmented subjects using a standard homogeneous model and the present two layer model.

C;Assessment of blood oxygen saturation using spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging as a biomarker for disease progression in a small-animal leukemia model;Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) interacts with bone marrow cells, creating hypoxic niches that stabilize HIF-1 alpha and promote chemotherapeutic resistance. Spectrosocopic photoacoustic (PA) imaging is a label-free, noninvasive technique that probes the in vivo oxygenation status of hemoglobin, resulting in a measurement of oxygen saturation (SO2) and providing a surrogate measure of tissue hypoxia. This work investigates multispectral PA imaging to assess the SO2 in the femoral bone marrow in mice. Preliminary work was performed to assess the capability of imaging through bone, followed by an oxygen challenge to determine the magnitude of systemic SO2 changes measurable in wild type mice. Furthermore, a pilot study to compare SO2 measured in a murine model of ALL versus in healthy controls was performed to investigate a correlation between SO2 changes in the femoral bone marrow and disease progression. Study results show that femoral SO2 can be measured with a variation less than 10% in wild type mice over multiple time-points. In the oxygen challenge, a 10% difference in systemic SO2 was observed between 100% and 21% O-2 inhalation conditions. Additionally, leukemic mice demonstrate significantly more variation in femoral SO2 over the length of the femur than control mice at day 14 post-inoculation, indicating that femoral SO2 is affected by leukemic disease progression. This work demonstrates the feasibility of observing changes in leukemic disease progression through the measurement of SO2 with spectroscopic PA imaging, which could help develop a more complete understanding of the interplay of the local microenvironment with leukemogenesis.;2018;10.1117/12.2293119
J;Noninvasive spectral imaging of skin chromophores based on multiple regression analysis aided by Monte Carlo simulation;In order to visualize melanin and blood concentrations and oxygen saturation in human skin tissue, a simple imaging technique based on multispectral diffuse reflectance images acquired at six wavelengths (500, 520, 540, 560, 580 and 600 nm) was developed. The technique utilizes multiple regression analysis aided by Monte Carlo simulation for diffuse reflectance spectra. Using the absorbance spectrum as a response variable and the extinction coefficients of melanin, oxygenated hemoglobin, and deoxygenated hemoglobin as predictor variables, multiple regression analysis provides regression coefficients. Concentrations of melanin and total blood are then determined from the regression coefficients using conversion vectors that are deduced numerically in advance, while oxygen saturation is obtained directly from the regression coefficients. Experiments with a tissue-like agar gel phantom validated the method. In vivo experiments with human skin of the human hand during upper limb occlusion and of the inner forearm exposed to UV irradiation demonstrated the ability of the method to evaluate physiological reactions of human skin tissue.

J;Spatial and Spectral Mapping and Decomposition of Neural Dynamics and Organization of the Mouse Brain with Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography;In traditional optical imaging, limited light penetration constrains high-resolution interrogation to tissue surfaces. Optoacoustic imaging combines the superb contrast of optical imaging with deep penetration of ultrasound, enabling a range of new applications. We used multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) for functional and structural neuroimaging in mice at resolution, depth, and specificity unattainable by other neuroimaging modalities. Based on multispectral readouts, we computed hemoglobin gradient and oxygen saturation changes related to processing of somatosensory signals in different structures along the entire subcortical-cortical axis. Using temporal correlation analysis and seed-based maps, we reveal the connectivity between cortical, thalamic, and sub-thalamic formations. With the same modality, high-resolution structural tomography of intact mouse brain was achieved based on endogenous contrasts, demonstrating near-perfect matches with anatomical features revealed by histology. These results extend the limits of noninvasive observations beyond the reach of standard high-resolution neuroimaging, verifying the suitability of MSOT for small-animal studies.;2019;10.1016/j.celrep.2019.02.020
J;Morphological analysis of aqueous humor drainage using QD nanoparticles and indocyanine green;This study represents the first morphological description of the lymphatic drainage of the ciliary body in vivo by comparative hyperspectral fluorescence imaging techniques of Quantum Qdot655 (QD) nanoparticles and indocyanine green (ICG). A volume of 1.25 mu l of QD was injected into the left anterior camera of all rats. Similarly,1.25 mu l of ICG diluted at a ratio of one-fourth with physiological saline solution was injected into the right anterior camera of all rats. The thickness of the skin in the mandibular area, connective tissue, and the depth of the mandibular lymph node (MLN) made image retrieval difficult. For QD, 302 nm UV excitation and 605 nm fluorescence peak emission were applied. The detection of QD and ICG used in this study in the MLNs is definitive evidence that aqueous humor (AH) follows a uveolymphatic pathway. Scanning electron microscope and the energy dispersive X-ray analyzer spectrum were used to examine both the Schlemm's canal and the MLN. For the first time, the QD was detected in the cortex of MLN. The QCM analysis of both QD-AH and ICG-AH was used to determine whether there was any interaction between them. This comparative study shows the importance of experimental animal modeling in pharmacological studies regarding eye research and drugs. In a female rat, the signal was taken from the parotid lymph node with QD injections.;2020;10.1002/jemt.23494
J;Real-time Volumetric Assessment of the Human Carotid Artery: Handheld Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography;Background: Multispectral optical imaging has the capability of resoling hemoglobin, lipid,and water. Volumetric multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is a hybrid imaging technique that provides a unique combination of functional and molecular contrast with real-time handheld imaging. Purpose: To investigate whether volumetric MSOT can provide real-time assessment of the anatomic and functional status of the human carotid artery bifurcation nonoinvasively. Materials and Methods: Imaging of healthy volunteers (n = 16) was performed with a custom-designed handheld volumetric MSOT scanner capable. of high-spatial-resolution (approximately 200 mu m) and real-time (10 volumes/sec) three-dimensional imaging, while further providing spectrosccopic capacity through fast tuning of the excitation light wavelength. For comparison and anatomic cross-validation, volunteers were also scanned with clinical B-mode US. Results: Volumetric MSOT achieved real-time imaging and characterization of the entire carotid bifurcation area across three dimensions simultaneously captured in a single volumetric image frame. Analysis of the acquired data further showed that a higher contrast-to-noise ratio can be achieved for wavelengths corresponding to a high optical absorption of oxygenated hemoglobin. Conclusion: The human carotid artery was visualized by using handheld volumetric multispectral optoacoustic tomography. This imaging approach is less prone to motion artifacts than are the conventional clinical imaging methods, holding promise for providing additional image-based biomarkers for noninvasive label-free assesment of carotid artery disease.

J;Development of a fluorescence detection system using optical parametric oscillator (OPO) laser excitation for in vivo diagnosis;In this work, the development and applications of a fluorescence detection system using optical parametric oscillator (OPO) laser excitation for in vivo disease diagnosis including oral carcinoma are described. The optical diagnosis system was based on an OPO laser for multi-wavelength excitation and time-resolved detection. The pulsed Nd-YAG-pumped OPO laser system (6 ns, 20 Hz) is compact and has a rapid, broad, and uniform tuning range. Time-gated detection of intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) making use of external triggering was used to effectively eliminate the laser scattering and contribute to the highly sensitive in vivo measurements. Artificial tissue-simulating phantoms consisting of polystyrene microspheres and tissue fluorophores were tested to optimize the gating parameters. 51-ns gate width and 39-ns gate delays were determined to be the optimal parameters for sensitive detection. In vivo measurements with the optical diagnosis system were applied to esophagus, stomach, and small intestine using an endoscope in canine animal studies. The rapid tuning capability of the optical diagnosis system contributed greatly to the optimization of wavelength for the observation of porphyrin in the small intestine. When the small intestine was thoroughly washed with water, the emission band which corresponds to porphyrin disappeared. Based on this observation, it was concluded that the detected signal was yielded by porphyrin-containing bile secretion. Also, multispectral analyses using multiple excitations from 415 to 480 nm at 5 nm intervals confirmed the porphyrin detection in the small intestine. The optical diagnosis system was also applied to the detection of human xenograft of oral carcinoma in mice using 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) which is a photodynamic therapy (PDT) drug. Significant differences in protoporphyrin IX fluorescence intensity between normal and tumor tissue could be obtained 2 hours after the injection of 5-ALA into mice due to the preferential accumulation of 5-ALA in tumors. Results reported herein demonstrate potential capabilities of the LIF-OPO system for in vivo disease diagnosis.;2003;10.1177/153303460300200604
J;A tissue factor-cascade-targeted nanoparticle forsite-directed inducing thrombosis;Tissue factor is an upstream component of the cascade and a high-expressing factor under phathological conditions. In this study, a tissue factor cascade-targeted strategy for inducing local thrombosis was developed by combining ENP-HMME and photochemistry. Invitro study showed that protein EGFP-EGF1 conjugation to the nanoparticles could significantly contribute to the uptake of nanoparticles by tissue factor over-expressed brain capillary endothelial cells. Three-dimensional imaging and specklegram of brains invivo showed that tissue factor cascade-targeted strategy successfully induced thrombosis of expected position. As shown by the invivo multispectral fluorescent imaging, when ENP-HMME was combined with photochemistry, higher accumulation in the infarction hemisphere was observed, which might suggest that the photochemistry inducing tissue factor cascade recruited more ENP-HMME than HMME-loaded nanoparticles (NP-HMME). The data indicated the tissue factor cascade-targeted strategy has potential to induce local thrombosis, and might be applied in the treatment of a variety of hypervascular diseases.;2017;10.1177/0885328217722740
J;Raman Imaging of Nanocarriers for Drug Delivery;The efficacy of pharmaceutical agents can be greatly improved through nanocarrier delivery. Encapsulation of pharmaceutical agents into a nanocarrier can enhance their bioavailability and biocompatibility, whilst also facilitating targeted drug delivery to specific locations within the body. However, detailed understanding of the in vivo activity of the nanocarrier-drug conjugate is required prior to regulatory approval as a safe and effective treatment strategy. A comprehensive understanding of how nanocarriers travel to, and interact with, the intended target is required in order to optimize the dosing strategy, reduce potential off-target effects, and unwanted toxic effects. Raman spectroscopy has received much interest as a mechanism for label-free, non-invasive imaging of nanocarrier modes of action in vivo. Advanced Raman imaging techniques, including coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), are paving the way for rigorous evaluation of nanocarrier activity at the single-cell level. This review focuses on the development of Raman imaging techniques to study organic nanocarrier delivery in cells and tissues.;2019;10.3390/nano9030341
J;Photoacoustic pump-probe tomography of fluorophores in vivo using interleaved image acquisition for motion suppressiony;In fluorophores, the excited state lifetime can be modulated using pump-probe excitation. By generating photoacoustic (PA) signals using simultaneous and time-delayed pump and probe excitation pulses at fluences below the maximum permissible exposure, a modulation of the signal amplitude is observed in fluorophores but not in endogenous chromophores. This provides a highly specific contrast mechanism that can be used to recover the location of the fluorophore using difference imaging. The practical challenges in applying this method to in vivo PA tomography include the typically low concentrations of fluorescent contrast agents, and tissue motion. The former results in smaller PA signal amplitudes compared to those measured in blood, while the latter gives rise to difference image artefacts that compromise the unambiguous and potentially noise-limited detection of fluorescent contrast agents. To address this limitation, a method based on interleaved pump-probe image acquisition was developed. It relies on fast switching between simultaneous and time-delayed pump-probe excitation to acquire PA difference signals in quick succession, and to minimise the effects of tissue motion. The feasibility of this method is demonstrated in tissue phantoms and in initial experiments in vivo.;2017;10.1038/srep40496
J;Dynamic imaging of PEGylated indocyanine green (ICG) liposomes within the tumor microenvironment using multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT);Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is a powerful modality that allows high-resolution imaging of photo-absorbers deep within tissue, beyond the classical depth and resolution limitations of conventional optical imaging. Imaging of intrinsic tissue contrast can be complemented by extrinsically administered gold nanoparticles or fluorescent molecular probes. Instead, we investigated herein generation of re-engineered clinically-used PEGylated liposomes incorporating indocyanine green (LipoICG) as a contrast strategy that combines materials already approved for clinical use, with strong photo-absorbing signal generation available today only from some metallic nanoparticles (e.g. gold nanorods). Using MSOT we confirmed LipoICG as a highly potent optoacoustic agent and resolved tissue accumulation in tumor-bearing animals over time with high-sensitivity and resolution using two tumor models of different vascularisation. We further showcase a paradigm shift in pharmacology studies and nanoparticle investigation, by enabling detailed volumetric optical imaging in vivo through the entire tumor tissue non-invasively, elucidating never before seen spatiotemporal features of optical agent distribution. These results point to LipoICG as a particle with significant advantageous characteristics over gold nanoparticles and organic dyes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J;Perilipin 5 mediated lipid droplet remodelling revealed by coherent Raman imaging;Accumulation of fat in muscle tissue as intramyocellular lipids (IMCLs) is closely related to the development of insulin resistance and subsequent type 2 diabetes. Most IMCLs organize into lipid droplets (LDs), the fates of which are regulated by lipid droplet coat proteins. Perilipin 5 (PLIN5) is an LD coating protein, which is strongly linked to lipid storage in muscle tissue. Here we employ a tandem in vitro/ex vivo approach and use chemical imaging by label-free, hyperspectral coherent Raman microscopy to quantify compositional changes in individual LDs upon PLIN5 overexpression. Our results directly show that PLIN5 overexpression in muscle alters individual LD composition and physiology, resulting in larger LDs with higher esterified acyl chain concentration, increased methylene content, and more saturated lipid species. These results suggest that lipotoxic protection afforded by natural PLIN5 upregulation in muscle involves molecular changes in lipid composition within LDs.;2015;10.1039/c4ib00271g
J;Improving sensitivity in nonlinear Raman microspectroscopy imaging and sensing;Nonlinear Raman microspectroscopy based on a broadband coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering is an emerging technique for noninvasive, chemically specific, microscopic analysis of tissues and large population of cells and particles. The sensitivity of this imaging is a critical aspect of a number of the proposed biomedical application. It is shown that the incident laser power is the major parameter controlling this sensitivity. By careful optimizing the laser system, the high-quality vibrational spectra acquisition at the multi-kHz rate becomes feasible. (C) 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

J;Rare-Earth-Doped Cerium Oxide Nanocubes for Biomedical Near-Infrared and Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence provides a new avenue for biomedical fluorescence imaging that allows for the tracking of fluorophore through several centimeters of biological tissue. However, such fluorophores are rare and, due to accumulation-derived toxicity, are often restricted from clinical applications. Deep tissue imaging not only provided by near-infrared fluorophores but also conventionally carried out by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) is also hampered by the toxicity of the contrast agents. This work offers a biocompatible imaging solution: cerium oxide (CeO2) nanocubes doped with ytterbium or neodymium, and co-doped with gadolinium, showing simultaneous potential for near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applications. A synthetic process described in this work allows for the stable incorporation of ytterbium or neodymium, both possessing emissive transitions in the NIR As a biocompatible nanomaterial, the CeO2 nanocubes act as an ideal host material for doping, minimizing lanthanide fluorescence self-quenching as well as any potential toxicity associated with the dopants. The uptake of nanocubes by HeLa cells maximized at 12 h was monitored by hyperspectral imaging of the ytterbium or neodymium NIR emission, indicating the capacity of the lanthanide-doped nanocubes for in vitro and a potential for in vivo fluorescence imaging. The co-doped nanocubes demonstrate no significant loss of NIR emission intensity upon co-doping with 2 atomic % gadolinium and exhibit magnetic susceptibilities in the range of known negative contrast agents. However, a small increase to 6 atomic % gadolinium significantly affects the magnetic susceptibility ratio (r(2)/r(1)), shifting closer to the positive contrast range and suggesting the potential use of the CeO2 nanocube matrix doped with selected rare-earth ions as a tunable MRI contrast agent with NIR imaging capabilities.;2020;10.1021/acsbiomaterials.0c01193
J;Visible to mid IR: A library of multispectral diagnostic imaging;Fluorescence imaging is an essential and interdisciplinary optical technique that uses light signals from molecules, cells, and living organisms to visualize dynamic biological processes. Moreover, with recent remarkable breakthroughs in the development of chemical mechanisms (e.g., aggregation-induced emission, donor-if-acceptor electron manipulation for near IR region II fluorescence emission, multi-photon absorption and molecular rotor), nanofabrication technologies, and newly discovered biomarkers, the opportunities to generate multifunctional bespoke probes for the rapid analysis and highly accurate diagnosis of early-stage cancers have increased. In this article, we mainly review the recent advances in some representative small molecule-based fluorescence probes and their nanocomposites with an emphasis on the design principles to enhance the recognition selectivity/sensitivity, improve the signal-to-background ratio, amplify the fluorescence emission brightness, and optimize the tissue penetration depth. Furthermore, we highlight the current challenges and further opportunities from the viewpoint of the practical applications of this emerging field. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

J;Optical imaging of pre-invasive breast cancer with a combination of VHHs targeting CAIX and HER2 increases contrast and facilitates tumour characterization;Background: Optical molecular imaging is an emerging novel technology with applications in the diagnosis of cancer and assistance in image-guided surgery. A high tumour-to-background (T/B) ratio is crucial for successful imaging, which strongly depends on tumour-specific probes that rapidly accumulate in the tumour, while non-bound probes are rapidly cleared. Here, using pre-invasive breast cancer as a model, we investigate whether the use of combinations of probes with different target specificities results in higher T/B ratios and whether dual-spectral imaging leads to improvements in tumour characterization. Methods: We performed optical molecular imaging of an orthotopic breast cancer model mimicking ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). A combination of carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)- and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-specific variable domains of the heavy chain from heavy-chain antibodies (VHHs) was conjugated either to the same fluorophore (IRDye800CW) to evaluate T/B ratios or to different fluorophores (IRDye800CW, IRDye680RD or IRDye700DX) to analyse the expression of CAIX and HER2 simultaneously through dual-fluorescence detection. These experiments were performed non-invasively in vivo, in a mimicked intra-operative setting, and ex vivo on tumour sections. Results: Application of the CAIX-and HER2-specific VHH combination resulted in an increase of the T/B ratio, as compared to T/B ratios obtained from each of these single VHHs together with an irrelevant VHH. This dual tumour marker-specific VHH combination also enabled the detection of small metastases in the lung. Furthermore, dual-spectral imaging enabled the assessment of the expression status of both CAIX and HER2 in a mimicked intra-operative setting, as well as on tumour sections, which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Conclusions: These results establish the feasibility of the use of VHH 'cocktails' to increase T/B ratios and improve early detection of heterogeneous tumours and the use of multispectral molecular imaging to facilitate the assessment of the target expression status of tumours and metastases, both invasive or non-invasively.;2016;10.1186/s13550-016-0166-y
J;Hyperspectral analysis applied to micro-Brillouin maps of amyloid-beta plaques in Alzheimer's disease brains;A recent investigation on the architecture and chemical composition of amyloid- (A) plaques in ex vivo histological sections of an A-overexpressing transgenic mouse hippocampus has shed light on the infrared light signature of cell-activation related biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. A correlation was highlighted between the biomechanical properties detected by Brillouin microscopy and the molecular make-up of A plaques provided by FTIR spectroscopic imaging and Raman microscopy (with correlative immunofluorescence imaging) in this animal model of the disease. In the Brillouin spectra of heterogeneous materials such as biomedical samples, peaks are likely the result of multiple contributions, more or less overlaid on a spatial and spectral scale. The ability to disentangle these contributions is very important as it may give access to discrete components that would otherwise be buried within the Brillouin peak envelope. Here, we applied an unsupervised non-negative matrix factorization method to analyse the spontaneous Brillouin microscopy maps of A plaques in transgenic mouse hippocampal sections. The method has already been proven successful in decomposing chemical images and is applied here for the first time to acoustic maps acquired with a Fabry-Perot Brillouin microscope. We extracted and visualised a decrease in tissue rigidity from the core through to the periphery of the plaque, with spatially distinct components that we assigned to specific entities. This work demonstrates that it is possible to reveal the structure and mechanical properties of A plaques, with details visualized by the projection of the mechanical contrast into a few relevant channels.;2018;10.1039/c8an01291a
J;Magnetic resonance imaging identifies the fibrous cap in atherosclerotic abdominal aortic aneurysm;Background - MRI can distinguish components of atherosclerotic plaque. We hypothesized that contrast enhancement with gadolinium- DTPA ( Gd- DTPA) could aid in the differentiation of plaque components in abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA). Methods and Results - Twenty- three patients ( 19 males, age 70 +/- 8 years) with AAA underwent MRI on a 1.5- T clinical scanner 3 +/- 3 days before surgical grafting. T1- and T2- weighted ( W) black blood spin echo imaging was performed in 1 axial slice, and the T1- W imaging was repeated after a Gd- DTPA - enhanced 3D magnetic resonance angiogram. A section of the aorta at the site of imaging was resected at surgery for histopathologic examination of tissue components and inflammatory cells. Signal- to- noise and contrast- to- noise ratios ( CNR) were measured in visualized plaque components from multispectral MRI, and percent enhancement after contrast on T1- W imaging was calculated. The kappa value for agreement between pathology and MRI for the number of tissue components was 0.785. T2- W imaging identified thrombus as regions of high signal and lipid core as low signal, with a CNR of 6.43 +/- 3.41. Nine patients had a fibrous cap pathologically, which was visualized as a discrete area of uniform increased signal on T2- W imaging with a CNR of 4.52 +/- 1.93 compared with lipid core. Within the cap, the percent enhancement after Gd- DTPA on T1- W imaging was 91 +/- 63%. Conclusions - Higher signal on T2- W MRI identifies the fibrous cap and thrombus within AAA. Contrast enhancement improves delineation of the fibrous cap. The addition of contrast to MRI plaque imaging may enhance identification of vulnerable plaque.;2004;10.1161/01.CIR.0000116767.95046.C2
J;Microcalcification-Based Tumor Malignancy Evaluation in Fresh Breast Biopsies with Hyperspectral Stimulated Raman Scattering;Precise evaluation of breast tumor malignancy based on tissue calcifications has important practical value in the disease diagnosis, as well as the understanding of tumor development. Traditional X-ray mammography provides the overall morphologies of the calcifications but lacks intrinsic chemical information. In contrast, spontaneous Raman spectroscopy offers detailed chemical analysis but lacks the spatial profiles. Here, we applied hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy to extract both the chemical and morphological features of the microcalcifications, based on the spectral and spatial domain analysis. A total of 211 calcification sites from 23 patients were imaged with SRS, and the results were analyzed with a support vector machine (SVM) based classification algorithm. With optimized combinations of chemical and geometrical features of microcalcifications, we were able to reach a precision of 98.21% and recall of 100.00% for classifying benign and malignant cases, significantly improved from the pure spectroscopy or imaging based methods. Our findings may provide a rapid means to accurately evaluate breast tumor malignancy based on fresh tissue biopsies.;2021;10.1021/acs.analchem.1c00522
J;Spatial frequency domain imager based on a compact multiaperture camera: testing and feasibility for noninvasive burn severity assessment;Significance: Spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) is a wide-field imaging technique that provides quantitative maps of tissue optical properties. We describe a compact SFDI imager that employs a multispectral compound-eye camera. This design enables simultaneous image acquisition at multiple wavelengths. Such a device has potential for application for quantitative evaluation of superficial tissues by nonspecialists in low-resource settings. Aim: The aim of this work was to develop a compact SFDI imager for widefield imaging of in-vivo tissue optical properties and verify its ability to measure optical properties of tissue-simulating phantoms and in a preclinical model of burn wounds. Approach: This compound-eye imager was constructed using a CMOS sensor subdivided into multiple regions, each having a bandpass filter and objective lens. The ability of the instrument to image optical properties was compared with (1) a commercial SFDI imager and (2) a laboratory-based system. Initial validation of ability to accurately characterize optical properties was performed using a tissue-simulating optical phantom. It was then applied to an established murine model of thermal contact burn severity. In-vivo measurements of the optical properties of rat skin were performed before and after the application of burns. Histology was used to verify burn severity. Results: Measurements of the tissue-simulating phantom optical properties made using the compound-eye imager agree with measurements made using the two comparison SFDI devices. For the murine burn model, the burns showed a decrease in the reduced scattering coefficient at all measurement wavelengths compared with preburn measurements at the same locations. This is consistent with previously reported changes in scattering that occur in full-thickness burns. Conclusion: We demonstrate the potential for SFDI to be translated into compact form factor using a compound-eye camera that is capable of obtaining multiple wavelengths channels simultaneously.

C;Hyperspectral fluorescence lifetime fibre probe spectroscopy for use in the study and diagnosis of osteoarthritis and skin cancer;We present the application of two fibre-optic-coupled time-resolved spectrofluorometers and a compact steady-state diffuse reflected light/fluorescence spectrometer to in vivo and ex vivo studies of skin cancer and osteoarthritis. In a clinical study of skin cancer, 27 lesions on 25 patients were investigated in vivo before surgical excision of the region measured. Preliminary analysis reveals a statistically significant decrease in the autofluorescence lifetime of basal cell carcinomas compared to neighbouring healthy tissue. A study of autofluorescence signals associated with the onset of osteoarthritis indicates autofluorescence lifetime changes associated with collagen degradation.;2011;10.1117/12.875120
J;A dual-modality optical coherence tomography and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy system for simultaneous morphological and biochemical tissue characterization;Most pathological conditions elicit changes in the tissue optical response that may be interrogated by one or more optical imaging modalities. Any single modality typically only furnishes an incomplete picture of the tissue optical response, hence an approach that integrates complementary optical imaging modalities is needed for a more comprehensive non-destructive and minimally-invasive tissue characterization. We have developed a dual-modality system, incorporating optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), that is capable of simultaneously characterizing the 3-D tissue morphology and its biochemical composition. The Fourier domain OCT subsystem, at an 830 nm center wavelength, provided high-resolution morphological volumetric tissue images with an axial and lateral resolution of 7.3 and 13.4 mu m, respectively. The multispectral FLIM subsystem, based on a direct pulse-recording approach (upon 355 nm laser excitation), provided two-dimensional superficial maps of the tissue autofluorescence intensity and lifetime at three customizable emission bands with 100 mu m lateral resolution. Both subsystems share the same excitation/illumination optical path and are simultaneously raster scanned on the sample to generate coregistered OCT volumes and FLIM images. The developed OCT/FLIM system was capable of a maximum A-line rate of 59 KHz for OCT and a pixel rate of up to 30 KHz for FLIM. The dual-modality system was validated with standard fluorophore solutions and subsequently applied to the characterization of two biological tissue types: postmortem human coronary atherosclerotic plaques, and in vivo normal and cancerous hamster cheek pouch epithelial tissue.

J;Topographic mapping of subsurface fluorescent structures in tissue using multiwavelength excitation;Different colors of visible light penetrate to varying depths in tissue due to the wavelength dependence of tissue optical absorption and elastic scattering. We exploit this to map the contour of the closest surface of a buried fluorescent object. This uses a novel algorithm based on the diffusion theory description of light propagation in tissue at each excitation wavelength to derive metrics that define the depth of the top surface of the object. The algorithm was validated using a tissue-simulating phantom. It was then demonstrated in vivo by subsurface brain tumor topography in a rodent model, using the fluorescence signal from protoporphyrin IX that is preferentially synthesized within malignant cells following systemic application of aminolevulinic acid. Comparisons to histomorphometry in the brain post mortem show the spatial accuracy of the technique. This method has potential for fluorescence image-guided tumor surgery, as well as other biomedical and nonbiological applications in subsurface sensing.

J;Photoacoustic Imaging in Biomedicine and Life Sciences;Photo-acoustic imaging, also known as opto-acoustic imaging, has become a widely popular modality for biomedical applications. This hybrid technique possesses the advantages of high optical contrast and high ultrasonic resolution. Due to the distinct optical absorption properties of tissue compartments and main chromophores, photo-acoustics is able to non-invasively observe structural and functional variations within biological tissues including oxygenation and deoxygenation, blood vessels and spatial melanin distribution. The detection of acoustic waves produced by a pulsed laser source yields a high scaling range, from organ level photo-acoustic tomography to sub-cellular or even molecular imaging. This review discusses significant novel technical solutions utilising photo-acoustics and their applications in the fields of biomedicine and life sciences.;2022;10.3390/life12040588
J;The Potential of Photoacoustic Imaging in Radiation Oncology;Radiotherapy is recognized globally as a mainstay of treatment in most solid tumors and is essential in both curative and palliative settings. Ionizing radiation is frequently combined with surgery, either preoperatively or postoperatively, and with systemic chemotherapy. Recent advances in imaging have enabled precise targeting of solid lesions yet substantial intratumoral heterogeneity means that treatment planning and monitoring remains a clinical challenge as therapy response can take weeks to manifest on conventional imaging and early indications of progression can be misleading. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging modality for molecular imaging of cancer, enabling non-invasive assessment of endogenous tissue chromophores with optical contrast at unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution. Preclinical studies in mouse models have shown that PAI could be used to assess response to radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy based on changes in the tumor vascular architecture and blood oxygen saturation, which are closely linked to tumor hypoxia. Given the strong relationship between hypoxia and radio-resistance, PAI assessment of the tumor microenvironment has the potential to be applied longitudinally during radiotherapy to detect resistance at much earlier time-points than currently achieved by size measurements and tailor treatments based on tumor oxygen availability and vascular heterogeneity. Here, we review the current state-of-the-art in PAI in the context of radiotherapy research. Based on these studies, we identify promising applications of PAI in radiation oncology and discuss the future potential and outstanding challenges in the development of translational PAI biomarkers of early response to radiotherapy.;2022;10.3389/fonc.2022.803777
J;Hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering microscopy facilitates differentiation of low-grade and high-grade human prostate cancer;Histopathology currently acts as a gold standard for human prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis. However, the subjective nature of histopathology leads to inevitable discordance among pathologists. Specifically, the inter-observer discordance could be up to 40% for the differentiation between Gleason score 6 (low-grade) and 7 (high-grade) of PCa. According to clinical guidelines, patients with high-grade PCa need to be actively treated, while patients with low-grade PCa could undergo active surveillance due to its slowly growing feature. Therefore, differentiating high-grade and low-grade PCa is an urgent clinical need. By integrating stimulated Raman scattering microscopy and confocal Raman spectroscopy, our previous study found the aberrant cholesteryl ester (CE) accumulation in human PCa tissues. However, no significant difference in CE accumulation between the low-grade and high-grade PCa was found, primarily because the previous study only analyzed the composition of manually selected lipid droplets (LDs) without quantitative analysis of the whole field of view. Here, we employed hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (HSRS) microscopy to test the hypothesis of CE as a marker for differentiation of low-grade and high-grade human PCa. First, lipid, lipofuscin, and protein were quantitatively mapped in human prostate tissues based on HSRS imaging of C-H vibrational region and multivariate curve resolution analysis. Then, within the lipid channel, CE percentage and unsaturation level of LDs were quantitatively mapped according to the height ratio between Raman bands at 2870 and 2850 cm(-1), and between Raman bands at 3006 and 2850 cm(-1), respectively. In total of 6 normal prostate tissues, 9 low-grade and 9 high-grade PCa tissues from patients, we found lipofuscin accumulation in all the normal prostate but none in PCa. While all the high-grade PCa tissues had LD accumulation, only 3 low-grade PCa tissues had LD accumulation. Notably, among all the PCa tissues with LD accumulation, no significant difference in LD amount was found between low-grade and high-grade PCa. Fortunately, both CE percentage and unsaturation level of the LDs were significantly different between low-grade and high-grade PCa. Furthermore, it was shown that CE percentage could differentiate low-grade and high-grade PCa with high sensitivity and specificity. Taken together, our study may provide a new opportunity towards more accurate PCa diagnosis.;2021;10.1088/1361-6463/ac2175
J;Spatial frequency domain imaging of burn wounds in a preclinical model of graded burn severity;Frequent monitoring of early-stage burns is necessary for deciding optimal treatment and management. Both superficial and full thickness burns are relatively easy to diagnose based on clinical observation. In between these two extremes are superficial-partial thickness and deep-partial thickness burns. These burns, while visually similar, differ dramatically in terms of clinical treatment and are known to progress in severity over time. The objective of this study was to determine the potential of spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) for noninvasively mapping quantitative changes in chromophore and optical properties that may be an indicative of burn wound severity. A controlled protocol of graded burn severity was developed and applied to 17 rats. SFDI data was acquired at multiple near-infrared wavelengths over a course of 3 h. Burn severity was verified using hematoxylin and eosin histology. From this study, we found that changes in water concentration (edema), deoxygenated hemoglobin concentration, and optical scattering (tissue denaturation) to be statistically significant at differentiating superficial partial-thickness burns from deep-partial thickness burns.

J;Optical biopsy mapping on endoscopic image mosaics with a marker-free probe;"Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early diagnosis significantly in-creases the chances of survival; therefore, improved assisted exploration and screening techniques are necessary. Previously, we made use of an augmented multi-spectral endoscope by inserting an optical probe into the instrumentation channel. However, the limited field of view and the lack of markings left by optical biopsies on the tissue complicate the navigation and revisit of the suspect areas probed in-vivo. In this contribution two innovative tools are introduced to significantly increase the traceability and monitoring of patients in clinical practice: (i) video mosaicing to build a more comprehensive and panoramic view of large gastric areas; (ii) optical biopsy targeting and registration with the endoscopic images. The proposed optical flow-based mosaicing technique selects images that minimize texture discontinuities and is robust despite the lack of texture and illumination variations. The optical biopsy targeting is based on automatic tracking of a free-marker probe in the endoscopic view using deep learning to dynamically estimate its pose during exploration. The accuracy of pose estimation is sufficient to ensure a precise overlapping of the standard white-light color image and the hyper-spectral probe image, assuming that the small target area of the organ is almost flat. This allows the mapping of all spatio-temporally tracked biopsy sites onto the panoramic mosaic. Experimental validations are carried out from videos acquired on patients in hospital. The proposed technique is purely software-based and therefore easily integrable into clinical practice. It is also generic and compatible to any imaging modality that connects to a fiberscope.";2022;10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.105234
J;Comparison of Cortical and Cutaneous Vascular Hemodynamic Changes in Hypoxia by Using in Vivo Skull and Skin Optical Clearing Techniques;Hypoxia occurs in various pathophysiological conditions. Especially, brain can be seriously affected by the oxygen deficiency. However, challenges exist in optically monitoring cerebral hemodynamics with high resolution. As an easily-detected vessel bed, peripheral skin is a potential target for predicting cerebrovascular hemodynamic changes. However, the similarities and differences between cerebral and cutaneous hemodynamics during hypoxia are still unclear. One of the main reasons is that optical imaging techniques are fundamentally depth/resolution-limited due to high scattering properties of turbid tissue. Fortunately, in vivo tissue optical clearing techniques can efficiently overcome these problems, and avoid the side-effects of surgical windows. In this work, we simultaneously monitor the changes in cortical and cutaneous microvascular blood oxygen and blood flow under the assistance of in vivo skull and skin optical clearing techniques, and quantitatively compared the differences between cerebral and cutaneous arteriovenous functional responses to the hypoxic stimulus. The results indicated that the variation tendency of blood oxygen response might be more similar, and cutaneous vascular blood oxygen response has the potential to serve as an accessible indicator for revealing cerebrovascular dysfunction. Moreover, it provides a feasible approach to realize visualization of in vivo monitoring cerebral and cutaneous microvascular reactivity with minimal invasiveness.;2021;10.1109/JSTQE.2021.3062595
J;Multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging device with a silicon avalanche photodetector;We report the design, development, and characterization of a novel multi-spectral fluorescence lifetime measurement device incorporating solid-state detectors and automated gain control. For every excitation pulse (similar to 1 mu J 600 ps), this device records complete fluorescence decay from multiple spectral channels simultaneously within microseconds, using a dedicated UV enhanced avalanche photodetector and analog to digital convert (2.5 GS/s) in each channel. Fast (<2 ms) channel-wise dynamic range adjustment maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio. Fluorophores with known lifetime ranging from 0.5-6.0 ns were used to demonstrate the device accuracy. Current results show the clear benefits of this device compared to existing devices employing microchannel-plate photomultiplier tubes. This is demonstrated by 5-fold reduction of lifetime measurement variability in identical conditions, independent gain adjustment in each spectral band, and 4-times faster imaging speed. The use of solid-state detectors will also facilitate future improved performance and miniaturization of the instrument.

J;Deep-Learning-Based Electrical Noise Removal Enables High Spectral Optoacoustic Contrast in Deep Tissue;Image contrast in multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) can be severely reduced by electrical noise and interference in the acquired optoacoustic signals. Previously employed signal processing techniques have proven insufficient to remove the effects of electrical noise because they typically rely on simplified models and fail to capture complex characteristics of signal and noise. Moreover, they often involve time-consuming processing steps that are unsuited for real-time imaging applications. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a discriminative deep learning approach to separate electrical noise from optoacoustic signals prior to image reconstruction. The proposed deep learning algorithm is based on two key features. First, it learns spatiotemporal correlations in both noise and signal by using the entire optoacoustic sinogram as input. Second, it employs training on a large dataset of experimentally acquired pure noise and synthetic optoacoustic signals. We validated the ability of the trained model to accurately remove electrical noise on synthetic data and on optoacoustic images of a phantom and the human breast. We demonstrate significant enhancements of morphological and spectral optoacoustic images reaching 19% higher blood vessel contrast and localized spectral contrast at depths of more than 2 cm for images acquired in vivo. We discuss how the proposed denoising framework is applicable to clinical multispectral optoacoustic tomography and suitable for real-time operation.;2022;10.1109/TMI.2022.3180115
J;Minimally invasive photoacoustic imaging: Current status and future perspectives;Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging biomedical imaging modality that is based on optical absorption contrast, capable of revealing distinct spectroscopic signatures of tissue at high spatial resolution and large imaging depths. However, clinical applications of conventional non-invasive PAI systems have been restricted to examinations of tissues at depths less than a few cm due to strong light attenuation. Minimally invasive photoacoustic imaging (miPAI) has greatly extended the landscape of PAI by delivering excitation light within tissue through miniature fibre-optic probes. In the past decade, various miPAI systems have been developed with demonstrated applicability in several clinical fields. In this article, we present an overview of the current status of miPAI and our thoughts on future perspectives.;2019;10.1016/j.pacs.2019.100146
C;Autofluorescence spectroscopy of cutaneous neoplasia under ultraviolet, visible and near infrared excitation;We investigated melanin-pigmented skin samples ex vivo, of benign and dysplastic nevi, as well as malignant melanoma, obtained after surgical excision, containing so called safety areas, where a normal skin could be observed, to obtain a complex and complete view about the feasibility of different excitation sources solely and/or in combination to induce fluorescence signal useful for diagnosis of pigmented cutaneous neoplasia. Using the specialized multispectral analysis of the data obtained by fluorescence using excitation in broad spectral range, covering ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared spectral range, contribute considerably to the both the fundamental determination of tumour tissues' basic spectral parameters, and to increasing the accuracy and specificity in determining the type of pathology when spectral techniques are used that are applicable to the clinical practice. Excitation wavelengths applied namely were 365, 385, 405, 630, 785 nm. As excitation sources were used set of laser and light emitting diodes with output power in the frames of 20-50mW. Microspectrometers USB4000 and QE65000 (Ocean Optics Inc, USA) in the range of 350-1100 nm were used as detectors of the fluorescence spectra obtained using UV-VIS-NIR excitation. These are preliminary investigations based on ex vivo samples, which would be followed by in vivo investigations and comparative studies to obtain the diagnostic accuracy, using optical spectral techniques, which would surpass the existing clinical techniques for early detection and evaluation of skin cancer. The achieved results demonstrate autofluorescence spectra efficiency in highlighting biochemical changes during tumor growth in a broad spectral range.;2020;10.1117/12.2555982
C;Imaging Small-animal Whole-body Dynamics by Single-impulse Panoramic Photoacoustic Computed Tomography;Small animal whole-body imaging, providing physiological, pathological, and phenotypical insights into biological processes, is indispensable in preclinical research. With high spatiotemporal resolution and functional contrast, small animal imaging can visualize biological dynamics in vivo at whole-body scale, which can advance both fundamental biology and translational medicine. However, current non-optical imaging techniques lack either spatiotemporal resolution or functional contrasts, and pure optical imaging suffers from either shallow penetration (up to similar to 1 mm) or a poor resolution-to-depth ratio (similar to 1/ 3). Here, we present a standalone system, termed single-impulse panoramic photoacoustic computed tomography (SIP-PACT), which overcomes all the above limitations. Our technology, with unprecedented performance, is envisioned to complement existing modalities for imaging entire small animals. As an optical imaging modality, SIP-PACT captures the high molecular contrast of endogenous substances such as hemoglobin, melanin, and lipid, as well as exogenous biomarkers, at the whole animal scale with full-view fidelity. Unlike other optical imaging methods, SIP-PACT sees through similar to 5 cm of tissue in vivo, and acquires cross-sectional images with an in-plane resolution of similar to 100 mu m. Such capabilities allow us to image, for the first time, mouse wholebody dynamics in real time with clear sub-organ anatomical and functional details and without motion artifacts. SIPPACT can capture transients of whole-body oxygen saturation and pulse wave propagation in vivo without labeling. In sum, we expect widespread applications of SIP-PACT as a whole-body imaging tool for small animals in fundamental biology, pharmacology, pathology, oncology, and other areas.;2017;10.1117/12.2251593
J;In Vivo Acceleration of Skin Growth Using a Servo-Controlled Stretching Device;Tension is a principal force experienced by skin and serves a critical role in growth and development. Optimal tension application regimens may be an important component for skin tissue engineering and dermatogenesis. In this study, we designed and tested a novel servo-controlled skin-stretching device to apply predetermined tension and waveforms in mice. The effects of static and cyclical stretching forces were compared in 48 mice by measuring epidermal proliferation, angiogenesis, cutaneous perfusion, and principal growth factors using immunohistochemistry, real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and hyperspectral imaging. All stretched samples had upregulated epidermal proliferation and angiogenesis. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor beta 1, and nerve growth factor demonstrated greater expression in cyclically stretched skin when compared to static stretch. Hypoxia-induced factor 1 alpha was significantly upregulated in cyclically stretched skin, but poststretch analysis demonstrated well-oxygenated tissue, collectively suggesting the presence of transient hypoxia. Waveform-specific mechanical loads may accelerate tissue growth by mechanotransduction and as a result of repeated cycles of temporary hypoxia. Further analysis of mechanotransduction signaling pathways may provide additional insight to improve skin tissue engineering methods and optimize our device.;2010;10.1089/ten.tec.2009.0185
J;Statistically strong label-free quantitative identification of native fluorophores in a biological sample;Bioimaging using endogenous cell fluorescence, without any external biomarkers makes it possible to explore cells and tissues in their original native state, also in vivo. In order to be informative, this label-free method requires careful multispectral or hyperspectral recording of autofluorescence images followed by unsupervised extraction (unmixing) of biochemical signatures. The unmixing is difficult due to the scarcity of biochemically pure regions in cells and also because autofluorescence is weak compared with signals from labelled cells, typically leading to low signal to noise ratio. Here, we solve the problem of unsupervised hyperspectral unmixing of cellular autofluorescence by introducing the Robust Dependent Component Analysis (RoDECA). This approach provides sophisticated and statistically robust quantitative biochemical analysis of cellular autofluorescence images. We validate our method on artificial images, where the addition of varying known level of noise has allowed us to quantify the accuracy of our RoDECA analysis in a way that can be applied to real biological datasets. The same unsupervised statistical minimisation is then applied to imaging of mouse retinal photoreceptor cells where we establish the identity of key endogenous fluorophores (free NADH, FAD and lipofuscin) and derive the corresponding molecular abundance maps. The pre-processing methodology of image datasets is also presented, which is essential for the spectral unmixing analysis, but mostly overlooked in the previous studies.;2017;10.1038/s41598-017-15952-y
J;Small near-infrared photochromic protein for photoacoustic multi-contrast imaging and detection of protein interactions in vivo;Photoacoustic (PA) computed tomography (PACT) benefits from genetically encoded probes with photochromic behavior, which dramatically increase detection sensitivity and specificity through photoswitching and differential imaging. Starting with a DrBphP bacterial phytochrome, we have engineered a near-infrared photochromic probe, DrBphP-PCM, which is superior to the full-length RpBphP1 phytochrome previously used in differential PACT. DrBphP-PCM has a smaller size, better folding, and higher photoswitching contrast. We have imaged both DrBphP-PCM and RpBphP1 simultaneously on the basis of their unique signal decay characteristics, using a reversibly switchable single-impulse panoramic PACT (RS-SIP-PACT) with a single wavelength excitation. The simple structural organization of DrBphPPCM allows engineering a bimolecular PA complementation reporter, a split version of DrBphP-PCM, termed DrSplit. DrSplit enables PA detection of protein-protein interactions in deep-seated mouse tumors and livers, achieving 125-mu m spatial resolution and 530-cell sensitivity in vivo. The combination of RS-SIP-PACT with DrBphP-PCM and DrSplit holds great potential for noninvasive multi-contrast deep-tissue functional imaging.;2018;10.1038/s41467-018-05231-3
C;Design of the stand for in vivo skin surface study by scattered ellipsometry method;Nowadays skin pathology detection on early stages is one of the progressive directions in medicine. Optical diagnostics methods allow to obtain data on skin's structure and composition, to examine biotissue processes without any negative impact on skin. Polarization diagnostics methods are very perspective. They are of interest due to biotissue-scattered optical fields polarization characteristics' high sensitivity to the structural features and physiological status of the study object. Implementation of quantitative ellipsometry in turbid media eventually can provide qualitatively new results with studies of the tissue's morphological and functional state which relate to the most important directions of today medical diagnostics. As a result development of theoretical and practical aspects of optically heterogeneous biological structures and polarized radiation interaction while solving the tasks of non-invasive rapid medical objects' state control is considered to be of current interest for improving of skin formation detection quality. The purpose of this study is to develop a stand for in vivo skin state examination by scattering ellipsometry with a help of studying of anisotropic skin environment influence on the polarization state evolution of the radiation propagating in this skin. The possibility of implementation the method of quantitative ellipsometry for in vivo skin's optical anisotropy and structural heterogeneity studies is shown. The Mueller matrix algebra is used for describing polarization properties of the depolarizing optically-active biotissue medium. A setup for recording the polarization state of the backscattered radiation was designed based on a comparative analysis of the technical options and their application in experiments with biotissue. To have a uniform intensity distribution along the cross section of the input radiation beam, and also to form the polarization states necessary for the study, using the emitting channel of the LEF-3 ellipsometer in the optical scheme of the stand is proposed. The choice of the radiation source wavelength in the spectral range (He-Ne laser, 632 nm) is justified, in which radiation scattering in turbid biological media predominates over absorption, which makes it possible to tell about the sample structural parameters by changing output radiation polarization state. The receiving channel of the output polarization state analyzer was designed, which contains based on a color matrix sensor with a unified analysis field video information block, that allows further multispectral studying of the skin surface structure. The method of a skin ellipsometric examination based on the distribution visualization of the polarization state parameters along the cross section of the output radiation beam and on its subsequent analysis is proposed. For image processing and calculation of the sample polarization characteristics an algorithm and software are developed with a Python language. In the backscattering mode of probing laser radiation the distributions of the skin sector containing scar structures polarization characteristics are obtained.;2018;10.1117/12.2306657
J;Hyperspectral Measurements Enable Pre-Symptomatic Detection and Differentiation of Contrasting Physiological Effects of Late Blight and Early Blight in Potato;In-vivo foliar spectroscopy, also known as contact hyperspectral reflectance, enables rapid and non-destructive characterization of plant physiological status. This can be used to assess pathogen impact on plant condition both prior to and after visual symptoms appear. Challenging this capacity is the fact that dead tissue yields relatively consistent changes in leaf optical properties, negatively impacting our ability to distinguish causal pathogen identity. Here, we used in-situ spectroscopy to detect and differentiate Phytophthora infestans (late blight) and Alternaria solani (early blight) on potato foliage over the course of disease development and explored non-destructive characterization of contrasting disease physiology. Phytophthora infestans, a hemibiotrophic pathogen, undergoes an obligate latent period of two-seven days before disease symptoms appear. In contrast, A. solani, a necrotrophic pathogen, causes symptoms to appear almost immediately when environmental conditions are conducive. We found that respective patterns of spectral change can be related to these differences in underlying disease physiology and their contrasting pathogen lifestyles. Hyperspectral measurements could distinguish both P. infestans-infected and A. solani-infected plants with greater than 80% accuracy two-four days before visible symptoms appeared. Individual disease development stages for each pathogen could be differentiated from respective controls with 89-95% accuracy. Notably, we could distinguish latent P. infestans infection from both latent and symptomatic A. solani infection with greater than 75% accuracy. Spectral features important for late blight detection shifted over the course of infection, whereas spectral features important for early blight detection remained consistent, reflecting their different respective pathogen biologies. Shortwave infrared wavelengths were important for differentiation between healthy and diseased, and between pathogen infections, both pre- and post-symptomatically. This proof-of-concept work supports the use of spectroscopic systems as precision agriculture tools for rapid and early disease detection and differentiation tools, and highlights the importance of careful consideration of underlying pathogen biology and disease physiology for crop disease remote sensing.;2020;10.3390/rs12020286
J;Snapshot Hyperspectral Volumetric Microscopy;The comprehensive analysis of biological specimens brings about the demand for capturing the spatial, temporal and spectral dimensions of visual information together. However, such high-dimensional video acquisition faces major challenges in developing large data throughput and effective multiplexing techniques. Here, we report the snapshot hyperspectral volumetric microscopy that computationally reconstructs hyperspectral profiles for high-resolution volumes of similar to 1000 mu m x 1000 mu m x 500 mu m at video rate by a novel four-dimensional (4D) deconvolution algorithm. We validated the proposed approach with both numerical simulations for quantitative evaluation and various real experimental results on the prototype system. Different applications such as biological component analysis in bright field and spectral unmixing of multiple fluorescence are demonstrated. The experiments on moving fluorescent beads and GFP labelled drosophila larvae indicate the great potential of our method for observing multiple fluorescent markers in dynamic specimens.;2016;10.1038/srep24624
C;Cell metabolism, tumour diagnosis and multispectral FLIM;Fluorescence guided diagnosis of tumour tissue is in many cases insufficient, because false positive results are interfering with the outcome. Discrimination between tumour and inflammation could be therefore difficult. Improvement of fluorescence diagnosis through observation of cell metabolism could be the solution, which needs a detailed understanding of the origin of autofluorescence. However, a complex combination of fluorophores give rise to the emission signal. Also in PDD (photodynamic diagnosis) different photosensitizer metabolites contribute to the fluorescence signal. Therefore, the fluorescence decay in many cases does not show a simple monoexponential profile. In those cases a considerable improvement could be achieved when time-resolved and spectral-resolved techniques are simultaneously incorporated. The discussion will focus on the detection of NADH, FAD and 5-ALA induced porphyrins. With respect to NADH and FAD the discrimination between protein bound and free coenzyme was investigated with multispectral FLIM in normal oral keratinocytes and squamous carcinoma cells from different origin. The redox ratio, which can be correlated with the fluorescence lifetimes of NADH and FAD changed depending on the state of the cells. Most of the investigations were done in monolayer cell cultures. However, in order to get information from a more realistic in vivo situation additionally the chorioallantoismembrane (CAM) of fertilized eggs was used where tumour cells or biopsies were allowed to grow. The results of theses measurements will be discussed as well.;2013;10.1117/12.2003729
J;Activatable Small Molecule Probes for Photoacoustic Imaging: Dyes and Applications;Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a non-invasive modality for molecular imaging and is on the way to becoming a routine clinical diagnostic tool. The advantage of PAI over many other currently used modalities is its ability to potentially image in vivo a variety of enzymatic and physiological processes as well as metabolites in real time at high tissue depths. For this purpose, photoacoustic signal generating chromophores, which have the ability to change their signal characteristics upon reaction, to their environments or trapping reactive species, are important. This review article provides an overview of the concepts for activatable small molecule probes for photoacoustic imaging, highlights the requirements for structural and optical properties, and describes their responses to the selective triggers.;2022;10.2174/0929867329666220208093735
J;Multispectral digital microscopy for in vivo monitoring of oral neoplasia in the hamster cheek pouch model of carcinogenesis;In this study we use a multi-spectral digital microscope (MDM) to measure multi-spectral auto-fluorescence and reflectance images of the hamster cheek pouch model of DMBA ( dimethylbenz[ a] anthracene)induced oral carcinogenesis. The multi-spectral images are analyzed both in the RGB ( red, green, blue) color space as well as in the YCbCr ( luminance, chromatic minus blue, chromatic minus red) color space. Mean image intensity, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis are selected as features to design a classification algorithm to discriminate normal mucosa from neoplastic tissue. The best diagnostic performance is achieved using features extracted from the YCbCr space, indicating the importance of chromatic information for classification. A sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 84% were achieved in separating normal from abnormal cheek pouch lesions. The results of this study suggest that a simple and inexpensive MDM has the potential to provide a cost-effective and accurate alternative to standard white light endoscopy.

J;Dual-color photoacoustic lymph node imaging using nanoformulated naphthalocyanines;Demarking lymph node networks is important for cancer staging in clinical practice. Here, we demonstrate in vivo dual-color photoacoustic lymphangiography using all-organic nanoformulated naphthalocyanines (referred to as nanonaps). Nanonap frozen micelles were self-assembled from two different naphthalocyanine dyes with near-infrared absorption at 707 nm or 860 nm. These allowed for noninvasive, nonionizing, high resolution photoacoustic identification of separate lymphatic drainage systems in vivo. With both types of nanonaps, rat lymph nodes buried deeply below an exogenously-placed 10 mm thick layer of chicken breast were clearly visualized in vivo. These results show the potential of multispectral photoacoustic imaging with nanonaps for detailed mapping of lymphatic drainage systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J;Principles of Quantitative MR Imaging with Illustrated Review of Applicable Modular Pulse Diagrams;Continued improvements in diagnostic accuracy using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging will require development of methods for tissue analysis that complement traditional qualitative MR imaging studies. Quantitative MR imaging is based on measurement and interpretation of tissue-specific parameters independent of experimental design, compared with qualitative MR imaging, which relies on interpretation of tissue contrast that results from experimental pulse sequence parameters. Quantitative MR imaging represents a natural next step in the evolution of MR imaging practice, since quantitative MR imaging data can be acquired using currently available qualitative imaging pulse sequences without modifications to imaging equipment. The article presents a review of the basic physical concepts used in MR imaging and how quantitative MR imaging is distinct from qualitative MR imaging. Subsequently, the article reviews the hierarchical organization of major applicable pulse sequences used in this article, with the sequences organized into conventional, hybrid, and multispectral sequences capable of calculating the main tissue parameters of T1, T2, and proton density. While this new concept offers the potential for improved diagnostic accuracy and workflow, awareness of this extension to qualitative imaging is generally low. This article reviews the basic physical concepts in MR imaging, describes commonly measured tissue parameters in quantitative MR imaging, and presents the major available pulse sequences used for quantitative MR imaging, with a focus on the hierarchical organization of these sequences.

J;Domain-Specific Image Analysis for Cervical Neoplasia Detection Based on Conditional Random Fields;This paper presents a domain-specific automated image analysis framework for the detection of pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions of the uterine cervix. Our proposed framework departs from previous methods in that we include domain-specific diagnostic features in a probabilistic manner using conditional random fields. Likewise, we provide a novel window-based performance assessment scheme for 2D image analysis which addresses the intrinsic problem of image misalignment. Image regions corresponding to different tissue types are indentified for the extraction of domain-specific anatomical features. The unique optical properties of each tissue type and the diagnostic relationships between neighboring regions are incorporated in the proposed conditional random field model. The validity of our method is examined using clinical data from 48 patients, and its diagnostic potential is demonstrated by a performance comparison with expert colposcopy annotations, using histopathology as the ground truth. The proposed automated diagnostic approach can support or potentially replace conventional colposcopy, allow tissue specimen sampling to be performed in a more objective manner, and lower the number of cervical cancer cases in developing countries by providing a cost effective screening solution in low-resource settings.;2011;10.1109/TMI.2011.2106796
J;Gold nanoparticles for photoacoustic imaging;Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is a biomedical imaging modality that provides functional information regarding the cellular and molecular signatures of tissue by using endogenous and exogenous contrast agents. There has been tremendous effort devoted to the development of PA imaging agents, and gold nanoparticles as exogenous contrast agents have great potential for PA imaging due to their inherent and geometrically induced optical properties. The gold-based nanoparticles that are most commonly employed for PA imaging include spheres, rods, shells, prisms, cages, stars and vesicles. This article provides an overview of the current state of research in utilizing these gold nanomaterials for PA imaging of cancer, atherosclerotic plaques, brain function and image-guided therapy.;2015;10.2217/NNM.14.169
C;The Application of Surgical Navigation System Using Optical Molecular Imaging Technology in Orthotopic Breast Cancer and Metastasis Studies;Currently, it has been an international focus on intraoperative precise positioning and accurate resection of tumor and metastases. The methods such as X-rays, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have played an important role in preoperative accurate diagnosis. However, most of them are inapplicable for intraoperative surgery. We have proposed a surgical navigation system based on optical molecular imaging technology for intraoperative detection of tumors and metastasis. This system collects images from two CCD cameras for real-time fluorescent and color imaging. For image processing, the template matching algorithm is used for multispectral image fusion. For the application of tumor detection, the mouse breast cancer cell line 4T1-luc, which shows highly metastasis, was used for tumor model establishment and a model of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expressing breast cancer. The tumor-bearing nude mice were given tail vein injection of MMP 750FAST (PerkinElmer, Inc. USA) probe and imaged with both bioluminescence and fluorescence to assess in vivo binding of the probe to the tumor and metastases sites. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed to confirm the presence of tumor and metastasis. As a result, one tumor can be observed visually in vivo. However liver metastasis has been detected under surgical navigation system and all were confirmed by histology. This approach helps surgeons to find orthotopic tumors and metastasis during intraoperative resection and visualize tumor borders for precise positioning. Further investigation is needed for future application in clinics.;2014;10.1117/12.2036182
J;High-resolution optoacoustic mesoscopy with a 24 MHz multidetector translate-rotate scanner;Optoacoustic (photoacoustic) mesoscopy aims at high-resolution optical imaging of anatomical, functional, and cellular parameters at depths that go well beyond those of optical-resolution optical or optoacoustic microscopy i.e., reaching several millimeters in depth. The approach utilizes tomography to achieve ultrasonic-diffraction resolution and operates at high-ultrasound frequencies (20 to 200 MHz) induced by few-nanosecond laser pulse excitation of tissues. We investigated here the performance of optoacoustic mesoscopy implemented at 24 MHz center frequency and its ability to resolve optical absorption contrast in the mouse kidney ex vivo. The developed system achieved better than 30 mu m in-plane resolution and 110 mu m elevation resolution over a cylindrical volume of 9-mm diameter and 9-mm height. This unprecedented combination of resolution and depth was achieved by implementing a translate-rotate detection geometry and by tomographic reconstruction. The approach yielded images of optically absorbing structures with a level of detail never-before visualized in an intact mouse kidney and allows insights into their unperturbed architecture. We discuss the ability to offer multispectral acquisitions and enable in vivo imaging. c 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE);2013;10.1117/1.JBO.18.10.106005
J;Development of a Multimodal Colposcopy for Characterization of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia;"To develop and evaluate the clinical application of a multimodal colposcopy combining multispectral reflectance, autofluorescence, and red, green, blue (RGB) imaging for noninvasive characterization of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). We developed a multimodal colposcopy system that combined multispectral reflectance, autofluorescence, and RGB imaging for noninvasive characterization of CIN. We studied the optical properties of cervical tissue first; then the imaging system was designed and tested in a clinical trial where comprehensive datasets were acquired and analyzed to differentiate between squamous normal and high grade types of cervical tissue. The custom-designed multimodal colposcopy is capable of acquiring multispectral reflectance images, autofluorescence images, and RGB images of cervical tissue consecutively. The classification algorithm was employed on both normal and abnormal cases for image segmentation. The performance characteristics of this system were comparable to the gold standard histopathologic measurements with statistical significance. Our pilot study demonstrated the clinical potential of this multimodal colposcopic system for noninvasive characterization of CIN. The proposed system was simple, noninvasive, cost-effective, and portable, making it a suitable device for deployment in developing countries or rural regions of limited resources.";2017;10.1115/1.4036335
J;Optoacoustic imaging identifies ovarian cancer using a microenvironment targeted theranostic wormhole mesoporous silica nanoparticle;At the intersection of the newly emerging fields of optoacoustic imaging and theranostic nanomedicine, promising clinical progress can be made in dismal prognosis of ovarian cancer. An acidic pH targeted wormhole mesoporous silica nanoparticle (V7-RUBY) was developed to serve as a novel tumor specific theranostic nanoparticle detectable using multispectral optoacoustic tomographic (MSOT) imaging. We report the synthesis of a small, < 40 nm, biocompatible asymmetric wormhole pore mesoporous silica core particle that has both large loading capacity and favorable release kinetics combined with tumor-specific targeting and gatekeeping. V7RUBY exploits the acidic tumor microenvironment for tumor-specific targeting and tumor-specific release. In vitro, treatment with V7-RUBY containing either paclitaxel or carboplatin resulted in increased cell death at pH 6.6 in comparison to drug alone (p < 0.0001). In orthotopic ovarian xenograft mouse models, V7-RUBY containing IR780 was specifically detected within the tumor 7X and 4X higher than the liver and > 10X higher than in the kidney using both multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging with secondary confirmation using near infrared fluorescence imaging (p < 0.0004). The V7-RUBY system carrying a cargo of either contrast agent or an anti-neoplastic drug has the potential to become a theranostic nanoparticle which can improve both diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer.;2018;10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.08.001
J;Dynamic and accurate assessment of acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity by integrated photoacoustic imaging and mechanistic biomarkers in vivo;"The prediction and understanding of acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury (APAP-ILI) and the response to therapeutic interventions is complex. This is due in part to sensitivity and specificity limitations of currently used assessment techniques. Here we sought to determine the utility of integrating translational non-invasive photo acoustic imaging of liver function with mechanistic circulating biomarkers of hepatotoxicity with histological assessment to facilitate the more accurate and precise characterization of APAP-ILI and the efficacy of therapeutic intervention. Perturbation of liver function and cellular viability was assessed in C57BL/6J male mice by Indocyanine green (ICG) clearance (Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT)) and by measurement of mechanistic (miR-122, HMGB1) and established (ALT, bilirubin) circulating biomarkers in response to the acetaminophen and its treatment with acetylcysteine (NAC) in vivo. We utilised a 60% partial hepatectomy model as a situation of defined hepatic functional mass loss to compared acetaminophen-induced changes to. Integration of these mechanistic markers correlated with histological features of APAP hepatotoxicity in a time dependent manner. They accurately reflected the onset and recovery from hepatotoxicity compared to traditional biomarkers and also reported the efficacy of NAC with high sensitivity. ICG clearance kinetics correlated with histological scores for acute liver damage for APAP (i.e. 3 h timepoint; r = 0.90, P < 0.0001) and elevations in both of the mechanistic biomarkers, miR-122 (e.g. 6 h timepoint; r = 0.70, P = 0.005) and HMGB1 (e.g. 6 h timepoint; r= 0.56, P = 0.04). For the first time we report the utility of this non-invasive longitudinal imaging approach to provide direct visualisation of the liver function coupled with mechanistic biomarkers, in the same animal, allowing the investigation of the toxicological and pharmacological aspects of APAP-ILI and hepatic regeneration.

J;The Status of Advanced Imaging Techniques for Optical Biopsy of Colonic Polyps;The progressive miniaturization of photonic components presents the opportunity to obtain unprecedented microscopic images of colonic polyps in real time during endoscopy. This information has the potential to act as optical biopsy to aid clinical decision-making, including the possibility of adopting new paradigms such as a resect and discard approach for low-risk lesions. The technologies discussed in this review include confocal laser endomicroscopy, optical coherence tomography, multiphoton microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and hyperspectral imaging. These are in different stages of development and clinical readiness, but all show the potential to produce reliable in vivo discrimination of different tissue types. A structured literature search of the imaging techniques for colorectal polyps has been conducted. The significant developments in endoscopic imaging were identified for each modality, and the status of current development was discussed. Of the advanced imaging techniques discussed, confocal laser endomicroscopy is in clinical use and, under optimal conditions with an experienced operator, can provide accurate histological assessment of tissue. The remaining techniques show potential for incorporation into endoscopic equipment and practice, although further component development is needed, followed by robust prospective validation of accuracy. Optical coherence tomography illustrates tissue texture well and gives good assessment of mucosal thickness and layers. Multiphoton microscopy produces high-resolution images at a subcellular resolution. Raman spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging are less developed endoscopically but provide a tissue fingerprint which can distinguish between tissue types. Molecular imaging may become a powerful adjunct to other techniques, with its ability to precisely label specific molecules within tissue and thereby enhance imaging.;2020;10.14309/ctg.0000000000000130

J;In vivo bioluminescence tomography with a blocking-off finite-difference SP3 method and MRI/CT coregistration;Purpose: Bioluminescence imaging is a research tool for studying gene expression levels in small animal models of human disease. Bioluminescence light, however, is strongly scattered in biological tissue and no direct image of the light-emitting reporter probe's location can be obtained. Therefore, the authors have developed a linear image reconstruction method for bioluminescence tomography (BLT) that recovers the three-dimensional spatial bioluminescent source distribution in small animals. Methods: The proposed reconstruction method uses third-order simplified spherical harmonics (SP3) solutions to the equation of radiative transfer for modeling the bioluminescence light propagation in optically nonuniform tissue. The SP3 equations and boundary conditions are solved with a finite-difference (FD) technique on a regular grid. The curved geometry of the animal surface was taken into account with a blocking-off region method for regular grids. Coregistered computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images provide information regarding the geometry of the skin surface and internal organs. The inverse source problem is defined as an algebraic system of linear equations for the unknown source distribution and is iteratively solved given multiview and multispectral boundary measurements. The average tissue absorption parameters, which are used for the image reconstruction process, were calculated with an evolution strategy (ES) from in vivo measurements using an implanted pointlike source of known location and spectrum. Moreover, anatomical information regarding the location of the internal organs and other tissue structures within the animal's body are provided by coregistered MR images. Results: First, the authors recovered the wavelength-dependent absorption coefficients (average error of 14%) with the ES under ideal conditions by using a numerical mouse model. Next, they reconstructed the average absorption coefficient of a small animal by using an artificial implanted light source and the validated ES. Last, they conducted two in vivo animal experiments and recovered the spatial location of the implanted light source and the spatial distribution of a bioluminescent reporter system located in the kidneys. The source reconstruction results were coregistered to CT and MR images. They further found that accurate bioluminescence image reconstructions could be obtained when segmenting a voidlike cyst with low-scattering and absorption parameters, whereas inaccurate image reconstructions were obtained when assuming a uniform optical parameter distribution instead. The image reconstructions were completed within 23 min on a 3 GHz Intel processor. Conclusions: The authors demonstrated on in vivo examples that the combination of anatomical coregistration, accurate optical tissue properties, multispectral acquisition, and a blocking-off FD-SP3 solution of the radiative transfer model significantly improves the accuracy of the BLT reconstructions.

J;Thermosensitive, Near-Infrared-Labeled Nanoparticles for Topotecan Delivery to Tumors;"Liposomal nanoparticles have proven to be versatile systems for drug delivery. However, the progress in clinic has been slower and less efficient than expected. This suggests a need for further development using carefully designed chemical components to improve usefulness under clinical conditions and maximize therapeutic effect. For cancer chemotherapy, PEGylated liposomes were the first nano-medicine to reach the market and have been used clinically for several years. Approaches toward targeted drug delivery using next generation thermally triggered nanoparticles are now in clinical trials. However, clinically tested thermosensitive liposomes (TSLs) lack the markers that allow tumor labeling improved imaging for tissue specific applied hyperthernia. Here we describe the development of optically labeled TSLs for image guidance drug delivery and proof-of-concept results for their application in the treatment of murine xenograft tumors using the anticancer drug topotecan. These labeled TSLs also allow the simultaneous, real-time diagnostic imaging of nanoparticle biodistribution using a near-infrared (NIR; 750-950 nm) fluorophore coupled to a lipidic component of the lipid bilayer. When combined with multispectral fluorescence analysis, this allows for specific and high sensitivity tracking of the nanoparticles in vivo. The application of NIR fluorescence-labeled TSLs could have a transformative effect on future cancer chemotherapy.";2015;10.1021/mp5002679
J;The need for speed;One of the key enabling features of coherent Raman scattering (CRS) techniques is the dramatically improved imaging speed over conventional vibrational imaging methods. It is this enhanced imaging acquisition rate that has guided the field of vibrational microscopy into the territory of real-time imaging of live tissues. In this feature article, we review several aspects of fast vibrational imaging and discuss new applications made possible by the improved CRS imaging capabilities. In addition, we reflect on the current limitations of CRS microscopy and look ahead at several new developments towards real-time, hyperspectral vibrational imaging of biological tissues.

J;Photoacoustic imaging of the spatial distribution of oxygen saturation in an ischemia-reperfusion model in humans;Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a novel hybrid imaging technique that combines the advantages of optical and ultrasound imaging to produce hyperspectral images of the tissue. The feasibility of measuring oxygen saturation (sO(2)) with PAI has been demonstrated pre-clinically, but has limited use in humans under conditions of ischemia and reperfusion. As an important step towards making PAI clinically available, we present a study in which PAI was used to estimate the spatial distribution of sO(2) in vivo during and after occlusion of the finger of eight healthy volunteers. The results were compared with a commercial oxygen saturation monitor based on diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. We here describe the capability of PAI to provide spatially resolved picture of the evolution of sO(2) during ischemia following vascular occlusion of a finger, demonstrating the clinical viability of PAI as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for diseases indicated by impaired microvascularization.

J;Fast Noninvasive Measurement of Brown Adipose Tissue in Living Mice by Near-Infrared Fluorescence and Photoacoustic Imaging;Aberrant brown adipose tissue (BAT) metabolism is linked to obesity as well as other metabolic disorders. However, the paucity of imaging tools limits the study of in vivo BAT metabolism in animal models. The current work evaluated a heptamethine dye (CyHF-8) in living mice as a dual-modality BAT-avid molecular probe for two imaging approaches, including near-infrared fluorescence imaging (NIRF) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI). CyHF-8 exhibited favorable spectral properties in the near-infrared window (786/787/805 nm) and accumulated in the subcellular mitochondria of brown adipocytes. After intravenous injection of CyHF-8, NIRF and PAI were both capable of noninvasively detecting interscapular BAT at early time points in living mice. Quantitative analysis of NIRF and PAI images showed that CyHF8 signals respond to dynamic BAT changes in mice stimulated by norepinephrine (NE) and in diabetic mice induced by streptozotocin (STZ). In summary, dual-modality NIRF/PAI probe CyHF-8 can be used for both NIRF and PAI to noninvasively assess BAT metabolism in living animals.;2020;10.1021/acs.analchem.9b05162
J;Deep thrombosis characterization using photoacoustic imaging with intravascular light delivery;Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a condition in which blood clots form within the deep veins of the leg or pelvis to cause deep vein thrombosis. The optimal treatment of VTE is determined by thrombus properties such as the age, size, and chemical composition of the blood clots. The thrombus properties can be readily evaluated by using photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT), a hybrid imaging modality that combines the rich contrast of optical imaging and deep penetration of ultrasound imaging. With inherent sensitivity to endogenous chromophores such as hemoglobin, multispectral PACT can provide composition information and oxygenation level in the clots. However, conventional PACT of clots relies on external light illumination, which provides limited penetration depth due to strong optical scattering of intervening tissue. In our study, this depth limitation is overcome by using intravascular light delivery with a thin optical fiber. To demonstrate in vitro blood clot characterization, clots with different acuteness and oxygenation levels were placed underneath ten-centimeter-thick chicken breast tissue and imaged using multiple wavelengths. Acoustic frequency analysis was performed on the received PA channel signals, and oxygenation level was estimated using multispectral linear spectral unmixing. The results show that, with intravascular light delivery, clot oxygenation level can be accurately measured, and the clot age can thus be estimated. In addition, we found that retracted and unretracted clots had different acoustic frequency spectrum. While unretracted clots had stronger high frequency components, retracted clots had much higher low frequency components due to densely packed red blood cells. The PACT characterization of the clots was consistent with the histology results and mechanical tests.;2022;10.1007/s13534-022-00216-0
J;Pulse length variation causing spectral distortions in OPO-based hyperspectral coherent Raman scattering microscopy;Picosecond optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) with broad wavelength tunability are frequently used as light sources in hyperspectral coherent Raman scattering (CRS) microscopy. We investigate how changes in the pulse length during OPO wavelength tuning of the pump beam affect hyperspectral CRS imaging. We find that significant distortions of the resulting CRS spectra occur if the OPO is operated without monitoring pulse length variations. By utilizing a custom-written MATLAB based control program to counteract changes in pulse length, normalized and reproducible data sets can be acquired. We demonstrate this by comparing hyperspectral data obtained from pure substances, as well as relevant biological specimens.

J;Simultaneous Raman Microspectroscopy and Fluorescence Imaging of Bone Mineralization in Living Zebrafish Larvae;Confocal Raman microspectroscopy and fluorescence imaging are two well-established methods providing functional insight into the extracellular matrix and into living cells and tissues, respectively, down to single-molecule detection. In living tissues, however, cells and extracellular matrix coexist and interact. To acquire information on this cell-matrix interaction, we developed a technique for colocalized, correlative multispectral tissue analysis by implementing high-sensitivity, wide-field fluorescence imaging on a confocal Raman microscope. As a proof of principle, we study early stages of bone formation in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae because the zebrafish has emerged as a model organism to study vertebrate development. The newly formed bones were stained using a calcium fluorescent marker and the maturation process was imaged and chemically characterized in vivo. Results obtained from early stages of mineral deposition in the zebrafish fin bone unequivocally show the presence of hydrogen phosphate containing mineral phases in addition to the carbonated apatite mineral. The approach developed here opens significant opportunities in molecular imaging of metabolic activities, intracellular sensing, and trafficking as well as in vivo exploration of cell-tissue interfaces under (patho-)physiological conditions.;2014;10.1016/j.bpj.2014.01.002
J;Insights into in vivo adipocyte differentiation through cell-specific labeling in zebrafish;White adipose tissue hyperplasia has been shown to be crucial for handling excess energy in healthy ways. Though adipogenesis mechanisms have been underscored in vitro, we lack information on how tissue and systemic factors influence the differentiation of new adipocytes. While this could be studied in zebrafish, adipocyte identification currently relies on neutral lipid labeling, thus precluding access to cells in early stages of differentiation. Here we report the generation and analysis of a zebrafish line with the transgene fabp4a(-2.7):EGFPcaax. In vivo confocal microscopy of the pancreatic and abdominal visceral depots of transgenic larvae, revealed the presence of labeled mature adipocytes as well as immature cells in earlier stages of differentiation. Through co-labeling for blood vessels, we observed a close interaction of differentiating adipocytes with endothelial cells through cell protrusions. Finally, we implemented hyperspectral imaging and spectral phasor analysis in Nile Red-labeled transgenic larvae and revealed the lipid metabolic transition towards neutral lipid accumulation of differentiating adipocytes. Altogether our work presents the characterization of a novel adipocyte-specific label in zebrafish and uncovers previously unknown aspects of in vivo adipogenesis.

J;Automatic multispectral MRI segmentation of human hippocampal subfields: an evaluation of multicentric test-retest reproducibility;Accurate and reproducible automated segmentation of human hippocampal subfields is of interest to study their roles in cognitive functions and disease processes. Multispectral structural MRI methods have been proposed to improve automated hippocampal subfield segmentation accuracy, but the reproducibility in a multicentric setting is, to date, not well characterized. Here, we assessed test-retest reproducibility of FreeSurfer 6.0 hippocampal subfield segmentations using multispectral MRI analysis pipelines (22 healthy subjects scanned twice, a week apart, at four 3T MRI sites). The harmonized MRI protocol included two 3D-T1, a 3D-FLAIR, and a high-resolution 2D-T2. After within-session T1 averaging, subfield volumes were segmented using three pipelines with different multispectral data: two longitudinal (long_T1s and long_T1s_FLAIR) and one cross-sectional (long_T1s_FLAIR_crossT2). Volume reproducibility was quantified in magnitude (reproducibility error-RE) and space (DICE coefficient). RE was lower in all hippocampal subfields, except for hippocampal fissure, using the longitudinal pipelines compared to long_T1s_FLAIR_crossT2 (average RE reduction of 0.4-3.6%). Similarly, the longitudinal pipelines showed a higher spatial reproducibility (1.1-7.8% of DICE improvement) in all hippocampal structures compared to long_T1s_FLAIR_crossT2. Moreover, long_T1s_FLAIR provided a small but significant RE improvement in comparison to long_T1s (p = 0.015), whereas no significant DICE differences were found. In addition, structures with volumes larger than 200 mm(3) had better RE (1-2%) and DICE (0.7-0.95) than smaller structures. In summary, our study suggests that the most reproducible hippocampal subfield FreeSurfer segmentations are derived from a longitudinal pipeline using 3D-T1s and 3D-FLAIR. Adapting a longitudinal pipeline to include high-resolution 2D-T2 may lead to further improvements.;2021;10.1007/s00429-020-02172-w
C;Improving colorectal cancer detection by extending the near-infrared wavelength range and tissue probed depth of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy: a support vector machine approach;Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most deadly and third most common type of cancer worldwide, accounting for 11.3% of all diagnosed cancer cases and 10.2% of all cancer-related deaths in 2020. Early CRC detection can decrease its incidence and substantially improve patient prognosis. Detection of potentially malignant lesions can be performed by optical techniques, which are molecular sensitive and have shown great potential for tissue differentiation and guidance of colorectal diagnostic procedures such as colonoscopy. One of these techniques is diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), which evaluates tissue biochemistry and micro/nano-structure based on its diffuse reflected light containing the information about tissue absorption and scattering properties. In this study, we assessed the improvement of the diagnostic potential of DRS for CRC detection upon extending the tissue probed depth and wavelength ranges investigated in previous studies. This assessment was performed by calculating classification performance metrics of differentiation between normal mucosa and cancer tissues by using 6 multivariate analysis models based on support vector machines (SVMs). Our dataset consisted of 2889 diffuse reflectance spectra over wavelengths between 350-1919 nm obtained from freshly excised ex vivo tissues of 47 patients. These spectra were collected with fiber optic probes with source-detector distances of 630 mu m and 2500-mu m to probe different depths. We achieved 93.5 +/- 2.4 % sensitivity, 94.0 +/- 1.7 % specificity and 0.971 +/- 0.014 AUC by sampling superficial colorectal tissues and 96.1 +/- 1.8 % sensitivity, 95.7 +/- 0.6 % specificity and 0.987 +/- 0.005 AUC by probing deeper tissue layers. Future research consists of developing a probe for CRC detection during colonoscopy.;2022;10.1117/12.2610497
C;Hyperspectral stimulated Raman microscopy with two fiber laser sources;A fast all fiber based setup for stimulated Raman microscopy based on a rapidly wavelength swept cw-laser is presented. The applied Fourier domain mode locked (FDML) laser is a fiber ring laser, providing a continuously changing wavelength output over time. This fast swept source allows us to rapidly change the wavelength and, thereby the energy difference with respect to a single color pump laser. The pump laser is a master oscillator power amplifier based on a fiber amplified laser diode and a Raman shifter. By controlled variation of the relative timing between probe and pump laser with an arbitrary waveform generator, the Raman signals are encoded in time and they are directly acquired with a synchronized, fast analog-to-digital converter. This setup is capable of acquiring rapidly high resolution spectra (up to 0.5 cm(-1)) with shot noise limited sensitivity over a broadband (750 cm(-1) to 3150 cm(-1)) spectral region. Here, we show the performance of this system for imaging in the CH-stretch region around 3000 cm(-1) and in the fingerprint region around 1600 cm(-1). We present hyperspectral images of a plant stem slice with molecular contrast of lignin and a lipid representative as well as images of PS (polystyrene) and PMMA (poly(methyl methacrylate) beads with an acquisition speed of 18 mu s per spectral point.;2015;10.1117/12.2183822
J;Optoacoustic Imaging of Human Vasculature: Feasibility by Using a Handheld Probe;Purpose: To investigate whether multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) developed for deep-tissue imaging in humans could enable the clinical assessment of major blood vessels and microvasculature. Materials and Methods: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University Medical Center Groningen (CCMO-NL-43587) and registered in the Dutch National Trial Registry (NTR4125). The authors designed a real-time handheld optoacoustic scanner for human use, based on a concave 8-MHz transducer array, attaining 135 degrees angular coverage. They applied a single-pulse-frame (SPF) sequence, which enabled motion insensitive optoacoustic imaging during handheld operation. SPF optoacoustic imaging was applied to imaging arteries and microvascular landmarks in the lower extremities of 10 healthy volunteers. The diameters selected microvessels were determined by measuring the full width at half maximum through the vessels in the MSOT images. Duplex ultrasonography was performed on the same landmarks in seven of the 10 volunteers for subjective comparison to the corresponding optoacoustic images. Results: Optoacoustic imaging resolved blood vessels as small as 100 mu m in diameter and within 1 cm depth. Additionally, MSOT provided images reflecting hemoglobin oxygen saturation in blood vessels, clearly identifying arteries and veins, and was able to identify pulsation in arteries during imaging. Larger blood vessels, specifically the tibialis posterior and the dorsalis pedis arteries, were also visualized with MSOT. Conclusion: Handheld MSOT was found to be capable of clinical vascular imaging, providing visualization of major blood vessels and microvasculature and providing images of hemoglobin oxygen saturation and pulsation.

J;Targeting Nanomedicines to Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Specificity of Ligands to Two Different Receptors In Vivo;"This manuscript utilised in vivo multispectral imaging to demonstrate the efficacy of two different nanomedicine formulations for targeting prostate cancer. Pegylated hyperbranched polymers were labelled with fluorescent markers and targeting ligands against two different prostate cancer markers; prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and the protein kinase, EphrinA2 receptor (EphA2). The PSMA targeted nanomedicine utilised a small molecule glutamate urea inhibitor of the protein, while the EphA2 targeted nanomedicine was conjugated to a single-chain variable fragment based on the antibody 4B3 that has shown high affinity to the receptor. Hyperbranched polymers were synthesised bearing the different targeting ligands. In the case of the EphA2-targeting nanomedicine, significant in vitro uptake was observed in PC3 prostate cancer cells that overexpress the receptor, while low uptake was observed in LNCaP cells (that have minimal expression of this receptor). Conversely, the PSMA-targeted nanomedicine showed high uptake in LNCaP cells, with only minor uptake in the PC3 cells. In a dual-tumour xenograft mouse model, the nanomedicines showed high uptake in tumours in which the receptor was overexpressed, with only minimal non-specific accumulation in the low-expression tumours. This work highlighted the importance of clearly defining the target of interest in next-generation nanomedicines, and suggests that dual-targeting in such nanomedicines may be a means to achieve greater efficacy.";2016;10.1007/s11095-016-1945-x
J;Transcranial Photoacoustic Detection of Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption Following Focused Ultrasound-Mediated Nanoparticle Delivery;"Purpose Blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD) is of interest for treating neurodegenerative diseases and tumors by enhancing drug delivery. Focused ultrasound (FUS) is a powerful method to alleviate BBB challenges; however, the detection of BBB opening by non-invasive methods remains limited. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate that 3D transcranial color Doppler (3DCD) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) combined with custom-made nanoparticle (NP)-mediated FUS delivery can detect BBBD in mice. Procedures We use MRI and stereotactic ultrasound-mediated BBBD to create and confirm four openings in the left hemisphere and inject intravenously indocyanine green (ICG) and three sizes (40 nm, 100 nm, and 240 nm in diameter) of fluorophore-labeled NPs. We use PAI and fluorescent imaging (FI) to assess the spatial distribution of ICG/NPs in tissues. Results A reversible 41 +/- 12 % (n = 8) decrease in diameter of the left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) relative to the right after FUS treatment is found using CD images. The spectral unmixing of photoacoustic images of the in vivo (2 h post FUS), perfused, and ex vivo brain reveals a consistent distribution pattern of ICG and NPs at *FUS locations. Ex vivo spectrally unmixed photoacoustic images show that the opening width is, on average, 1.18 +/- 0.12 mm and spread laterally 0.49 +/- 0.05 mm which correlated well with the BBB opening locations on MR images. In vivo PAI confirms a deposit of NPs in tissues for hours and potentially days, is less sensitive to NPs of lower absorbance at a depth greater than 3 mm and too noisy with NPs above an absorbance of 85.4.

J;High-Throughput Molecular Imaging via Deep-Learning-Enabled Raman Spectroscopy;Raman spectroscopy enables nondestructive, label-free imaging with unprecedented molecular contrast, but is limited by slow data acquisition, largely preventing high-throughput imaging applications. Here, we present a comprehensive framework for higher-throughput molecular imaging via deep-learning-enabled Raman spectroscopy, termed DeepeR, trained on a large data set of hyperspectral Raman images, with over 1.5 million spectra (400 h of acquisition) in total. We first perform denoising and reconstruction of low signal-to-noise ratio Raman molecular signatures via deep learning, with a 10x improvement in the mean-squared error over common Raman filtering methods. Next, we develop a neural network for robust 2-4X spatial super-resolution of hyperspectral Raman images that preserve molecular cellular information. Combining these approaches, we achieve Raman imaging speed-ups of up to 40-90X, enabling good-quality cellular imaging with a high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio in under 1 min. We further demonstrate Raman imaging speed-up of 160x, useful for lower resolution imaging applications such as the rapid screening of large areas or for spectral pathology. Finally, transfer learning is applied to extend DeepeR from cell to tissue-scale imaging. DeepeR provides a foundation that will enable a host of higher-throughput Raman spectroscopy and molecular imaging applications across biomedicine.;2021;10.1021/acs.analchem.1c02178
J;Spectroscopic optical coherence elastography;We present an optical technique to image the frequency-dependent complex mechanical response of a viscoelastic sample. Three-dimensional hyperspectral data, comprising two-dimensional B-mode images and a third dimension corresponding to vibration frequency, were acquired from samples undergoing external mechanical excitation in the audio-frequency range. We describe the optical coherence tomography (OCT) signal when vibration is applied to a sample and detail the processing and acquisition techniques used to extract the local complex mechanical response from three-dimensional data that, due to a wide range of vibration frequencies, possess a wide range of sample velocities. We demonstrate frequency-dependent contrast of the displacement amplitude and phase of a silicone phantom containing inclusions of higher stiffness. Measurements of an ex vivo tumor margin demonstrate distinct spectra between adipose and tumor regions, and images of displacement amplitude and phase demonstrated spatially-resolved contrast. Contrast was also observed in displacement amplitude and phase images of a rat muscle sample. These results represent the first demonstration of mechanical spectroscopy based on B-mode OCT imaging. Spectroscopic optical coherence elastography (S-OCE) provides a high-resolution imaging capability for the detection of tissue pathologies that are characterized by a frequency-dependent viscoelastic response.

J;Validating tyrosinase homologue melA as a photoacoustic reporter gene for imaging Escherichia coli;To understand the pathogenic processes for infectious bacteria, appropriate research tools are required for replicating and characterizing infections. Fluorescence and bioluminescence imaging have primarily been used to image infections in animal models, but optical scattering in tissue significantly limits imaging depth and resolution. Photoacoustic imaging, which has improved depth-to-resolution ratio compared to conventional optical imaging, could be useful for visualizing melA-expressing bacteria since melA is a bacterial tyrosinase homologue which produces melanin. Escherichia coli-expressing melA was visibly dark in liquid culture. When melA-expressing bacteria in tubes were imaged with a VisualSonics Vevo LAZR system, the signal-to-noise ratio of a 9x dilution sample was 55, suggesting that similar to 20 bacteria cells could be detected with our system. Multispectral (680, 700, 750, 800, 850, and 900 nm) analysis of the photoacoustic signal allowed unmixing of melA-expressing bacteria from blood. To compare photoacoustic reporter gene melA (using Vevo system) with luminescent and fluorescent reporter gene Nano-lantern (using Bruker Xtreme In-Vivo system), tubes of bacteria expressing melA or Nano-lantern were submerged 10 mm in 1% Intralipid, spaced between <1 and 20 mm apart from each other, and imaged with the appropriate imaging modality. Photoacoustic imaging could resolve the two tubes of melA-expressing bacteria even when the tubes were less than 1 mm from each other, while bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging could not resolve the two tubes of Nano-lantern- expressing bacteria even when the tubes were spaced 10 mm from each other. After injecting 100-mu L of melA-expressing bacteria in the back flank of a chicken embryo, photoacoustic imaging allowed visualization of melA-expressing bacteria up to 10-mm deep into the embryo. Photoacoustic signal from melA could also be separated from deoxy-and oxy-hemoglobin signal observed within the embryo and chorioallantoic membrane. Our results suggest that melA is a useful photoacoustic reporter gene for visualizing bacteria, and further work incorporating photoacoustic reporters into infectious bacterial strains is warranted.

J;Simultaneous, label-free, multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging and optical coherence tomography using a double-clad fiber;We present a novel fiber-based imaging platform that allows simultaneous fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) using a double-clad fiber. This platform acquires co-registered images showing structural and compositional contrast in unlabeled biological samples by scanning the fiber tip across the sample surface. In this Letter, we report a characterization of each modality and show examples of co-registered FLIm and OCT images acquired from a lemon segment and a section of human coronary artery. The close comparison between the combined FLIm and OCT images and a coregistered histology section provides a qualitative validation of the technique and highlights its potential for minimally invasive, multimodal imaging of tissue structure and composition.

J;Hand-held optoacoustic imaging: A review;"Optoacoustic imaging is a medical imaging modality that uses optical excitation and acoustic detection to generate images of tissue structures based up optical absorption within a tissue sample. This imaging modality has been widely explored as a tool for a number of clinical applications, including cancer diagnosis and wound healing tracking. Recently, the optoacoustic imaging community has published a number of reports of hand-held optoacoustic imaging devices and platforms; these hand-held configurations improve the modality's potential for commercial clinical implementation. Here, we review recent advancements in hand-held optoacoustic imaging platforms and methods, including recent pre-clinical applications, and we present an overview of the remaining limitations in optoacoustic imaging that must be addressed to increase the translation of the modality into commercial and clinical use.";2018;10.1016/j.pacs.2018.07.001
C;Non-contact photoacoustic characterization of retinal vasculature for brain-injury assessment;This paper describes use of a non-contact photoacoustic method to characterize blood vessels in the retina for brain injury assessment. Retinal hemorrhages (RHs) and vascular abnormalities can serve as diagnostic indicators of head trauma. Ensuring an accurate and complete diagnosis of the trauma requires a quantitative description of the hemorrhages. In this work, we describe an optical interferometry-based photoacoustic (PA) microscope (PAM) to remotely evaluate retinal tissue at sub-micron resolution with an ultra-broadband detection bandwidth (1 GHz). To demonstrate feasibility, ex-vivo porcine retina specimens containing typical blood-vessel networks were imaged using our all-optical PAM. PA signals were generated in the tissue by a 532-nm pulsed laser, and PA-induced broadband ultrasound signals were detected at the surface of the specimen using an optical interferometer operating at 532 nm. K-space reconstruction methods were employed to obtain the tissue properties by time-reversing and back-propagating the measured signals into the medium. A tunable pulsed laser was employed to perform multispectral PA imaging of the vasculature to demonstrate feasibility of measuring blood volume, oxygen concentration and lipids. Multispectral PA data were obtained to a depth of 5 mm, in raster-scanned steps of 50 microns over the wavelength range of 680 to 950 nm.;2014;10.1109/ULTSYM.2014.0207
J;Assessing autophagy in murine skeletal muscle: current findings to modulate and quantify the autophagic flux;Purpose of review In addition to the currently available lysosomotropic drugs and autophagy whole-body knockout mouse models, we provide alternative methods that enable the modulation and detection of autophagic flux in vivo, discussing advantages and disadvantages of each method. Recent findings With the autophagosome-lysosome fusion inhibitor colchicine in skeletal muscle and temporal downregulation of autophagy using a novel Autophagy related 5-short hairpin RNA (Atg5-shRNA) mouse model we mention two models that directly modulate autophagy flux in vivo. Furthermore, methods to quantify autophagy flux, such as mitophagy transgenic reporters, in situ immunofluorescent staining and multispectral imaging flow cytometry, in mature skeletal muscle and cells are addressed. To achieve clinical benefit, less toxic, temporary and cell-type-specific modulation of autophagy should be pursued further. A temporary knockdown as described for the Atg5-shRNA mice could provide a first insight into possible implications of autophagy inhibition. However, it is also important to take a closer look into the methods to evaluate autophagy after harvesting the tissue. In particular caution is required when experimental conditions can influence the final measurement and this should be pretested carefully.;2019;10.1097/MCO.0000000000000579
C;Diagnosis of uterine cervix cancer using Muller polarimetry: a comparison with histopathology;Today around 275000 women a year in the world keep dying from the cancer of uterine cervix due to the difficulty to meet the logistic requirements of an organized screening in the developing world. Polarimetric imaging is a new promising technique with a tremendous potential for applications in biomedical diagnostics: it is sensitive to slight morphological changes in tissues, can provide wide field images for the screening and requires light sources such as a LED for example. This work intends to characterize the polarimetric response of the uterine cervix in its healthy and pathological states. An extensive series of ex-vivo measurements is in progress the Kremlin Bicetre hospital near Paris using an imaging multispectral Mueller polarimeter in backscattering configuration. The goal of this study is to evaluate the performances of polarimetric imaging technique in terms of sensitivity and specificity for the detection of healthy epithelia (Healthy Squamous epithelium and Malpighian Metaplasia) with respect to the diagnosis provided by pathologists from histology slides as the gold standard. We show that, at lambda=550nm, performances as high as 62% sensitivity and 64% specificity are achieved by optimizing a simple threshold on the scalar retardance values.;2015;10.1117/12.2192423
J;Aminopeptidase N Activatable Nanoprobe for Tracking Lymphatic Metastasis and Guiding Tumor Resection Surgery via Optoacoustic/ NIR-II Fluorescence Dual-Mode Imaging;Lymphatic metastasis is a crucial mechanism by which the cancer cells break away from the primary (original) tumor and travel to the closest regional lymph node(s) and ultimately to other organs or parts of the body, which is closely associated with tumor recurrence and reduced survival. Thus, tracking tumor lymphatic metastasis and realizing imaging-guided lymphoma resection surgery is of great significance. In this study, an activatable nanoprobe is developed for precisely tracking lymphatic metastasis of tumors and imaging-guided resection of the primary tumor and metastatic lymphoma. The molecular probe contains tricyanofuran as the electron-accepting unit (electron acceptor), xanthene as the electron-donating unit (electron donor), and alanine as the responsive unit (recognition moiety) for aminopeptidase N, and the probe molecules form the nanoprobe with bovine serum albumin as the matrix. The nanoprobe can respond specifically to aminopeptidase N overproduced in the tumor, thereby transmuting the alanine into an amino group, and correspondingly the nanoprobe is activated. Strong optoacoustic and NIRII fluorescence signals emitted by the activated nanoprobe can be utilized for visualizing the lymphatic metastasis of tumors. Moreover, the nanoprobe with the aid of three-dimensional multispectral optoacoustic tomography (3D MSOT) imaging can accurately locate the tumor site of lymphatic metastasis, and ultimately, both the primary tumor and the metastatic lymphoma can be excised with resection surgery under the guidance of NIR-II fluorescence imaging.;2022;10.1021/acs.analchem.2c01241
J;Quantum Dots Brighten Biological Imaging;Quantum dots (QDs) are novel photostable semiconductor nanocrystals possessing wide excitation spectra and narrow, symmetrical emission spectra and can be conjugated to a wide range of biological targets, including proteins, antibodies and nucleic acid probes. These characteristics have provoked considerable interest in their use for bioimaging. Much investigation has been performed into their use for multiplex immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation which, when combined with multispectral imaging. has enabled quantitation and colocalisation of gene expression in clinical tissue. Many advances have recently been made using QDs for live cell and in vivo imaging, in which QD-labelled molecules can be tracked and visualised in 3-D. This review aims to outline the beneficial properties presented by QDs along with important advances in their biological application. (c) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

J;Noninvasive in vivo tomographic optical imaging of cellular morphology in the breast: Possible convergence of microscopic pathology and macroscopic radiology;This article presents a pilot study of multispectral diffuse optical tomography for noninvasively imaging volume fraction and mean size of cellular scattering components in the breast. Cellular morphology images for a total of 14 cases (four malignant breast and ten benign lesions) were obtained. Analyzing the images based on the pathological findings of the cases studied, we found that light scattering in the breast was contributed from both the nucleus and organelles such as mitochondria and nucleolus. Based on the image analysis of these 14 cases, we found that the differences in the mean size and volume fraction between the malignant and benign lesions are significant. The contrast ratio of the average mean size and volume fraction between malignant and benign lesions were calculated to be 3.38 and 2.63. These initial results suggest that cellular mean size and volume fraction may be two new criteria that could be used to differentiate malignant from benign lesions.

J;Hyperspectral excitation-resolved fluorescence tomography of quantum dots;The proposed method exploits the spectral properties of tissue hemoglobin for the purpose of 3D image reconstruction of quantum dot reporter probes inside scattering tissue. It advances fluorescence tomography in such way that only a single light source with tunable wavelength selection is required for fluorescence stimulation and image reconstruction. Numerical results suggest that current planar surface imaging technology could easily be retrofitted for performing fluorescence tomography without the use of elaborate source-detector multiplexing.

C;Dependence of photoacoustic signal generation characteristics on fluorescence quantum yields of small organic molecule based contrast agents;Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is advantageous in contrast agent imaging because of high spatial resolution at depth more than several millimeter inside biological tissues. To detect small tumors specifically, we are developing small organic molecule-based activatable PA probe with mechanism similar to that of the enzyme-activatable fluorescence probe that have successfully used for rapid fluorescence imaging of small tumors. The probe can be imaged also by fluorescence imaging and the fluorescence image can be merged onto the PA images. To extend the imaging depth by increasing PA signal intensity, PA probe that produce PA signals efficiently is required. To select small organic molecules suitable for PA probe, we synthesized small-organic molecule-based contrast agents with various absorption spectra and fluorescence quantum yields and then we exhaustively evaluated their PA signal generation characteristics including PA signal generation efficiencies. To analyze PA signal generation efficiencies precisely, the absolute values of PA signal pressures produced from aqueous solutions of the contrast agents were measured by P(VDF-TrFE) piezoelectric film acoustic sensor. As a result, small organic molecule with low fluorescence quantum yield produced PA signals efficiently. Thus, as opposed to fluorescence probes, PA probes should have low fluorescence quantum yields. By considering the result and other characteristics including excitation wavelengths, we could single out the small organic molecule suitable for PA probe. We synthesized the new activatable PA probe with low fluorescence quantum yield and excitation wavelength longer than 600 nm and its specificity was examined in in vitro experiment.;2017;10.1117/12.2255594
J;Imaging-Guided Evaluation of the Novel Small-Molecule Benzosuberene Tubulin-Binding Agent KGP265 as a Potential Therapeutic Agent for Cancer Treatment;The selective disruption of tumor-associated vasculature represents an attractive therapeutic approach. We have undertaken the first in vivo evaluation of KGP265, a water-soluble prodrug of a benzosuberene-based tubulin-binding agent, and found promising vascular-disrupting activity in three distinct tumor types. Dose escalation in orthotopic MDA-MB-231-luc breast tumor xenografts in mice indicated that higher doses produced more effective vascular shutdown, as revealed by dynamic bioluminescence imaging (BLI). In syngeneic orthotopic 4T1-luc breast and RENCA-luc kidney tumors, dynamic BLI and oxygen enhanced multispectral optoacoustic tomography (OE-MSOT) were used to compare vascular shutdown following the administration of KGP265 (7.5 mg/kg). The BLI signal and vascular oxygenation response (Delta sO(2)) to a gas breathing challenge were both significantly reduced within 2 h, indicating vascular disruption, which continued over 24 h. A correlative histology confirmed increased necrosis and hemorrhage. Twice-weekly doses of KGP265 caused significant growth delay in both MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 breast tumors, with no obvious systemic toxicity. A combination with carboplatin produced significantly greater tumor growth delay than carboplatin alone, though significant carboplatin-associated toxicity was observed (whole-body weight loss). KGP265 was found to be effective at low concentrations, generating long-term vascular shutdown and tumor growth delay, thus providing strong rationale for further development, particularly in combination therapies.;2021;10.3390/cancers13194769
J;Real-Time Monitoring of Pharmacokinetics of Antibiotics in Biofilms with Raman-Tagged Hyperspectral Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy;Antibiotics resistance developed by biofilms has posed a clinical challenge in the effective treatment of bacterial infections. However, the resistance mechanisms have not been well understood due to a lack of suitable tools for dynamic observation of the interplay between antibiotics and biofilm. In this work, with the use of rapid hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering microscopy associated with an aryl-alkyne-based Raman tag synthesized, we investigate dynamic interactions between vancomycin and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) biofilm to gain new insights into the resistance mechanisms of the biofilm. Methods: We utilize spectral focusing hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering microscopy ensued with multivariate curve resolution analysis to spectrally decompose S. aureus biofilm into its major components (i.e., bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances). Concurrently, vancomycin is conjugated with aryl-alkyne Raman tag (Raman peak at 2218 cm(-1)) for in vivo tracking of its uptake into biofilm without tissue interference. Results: We find that vancomycin penetration is a non-uniform diffusion process with penetration depths limited by the preferential affinity to the cell clusters. Semi-quantitative analysis shows that the majority of vancomycin binds to the bacteria, achieving intracellular concentrations of up to 4- to 10- fold higher than the administered dosage. The diffusion constant of similar to 3.16 mu m(2)/min based on the diffusion and antibiotic binding equations is obtained that well accounts for the antibiotic penetration into the biofilm. SRS longitudinal monitoring of antibiotic effect on the growth of biofilms shows that the antibiotics can eradicate the upper layer of the biofilm exposed to sufficient dosages, while the lower layer of the biofilm at a sub-inhibitory dose remains viable, eventually re-growing to significant bio-volume. Conclusion: The Raman-tagged hyperspectral SRS microscopy developed is a powerful imaging tool for dynamic monitoring of inhibitory effects of antibiotics on the growing biofilm in vivo, which would facilitate the formulation of new antibiotics for more effective treatments of bacterial infections in near future.;2019;10.7150/thno.32043
J;Photoacoustic imaging for microcirculation;Microcirculation facilitates the blood-tissue exchange of nutrients and regulates blood perfusion. It is, therefore, essential in maintaining tissue health. Aberrations in microcirculation are potentially indicative of underlying cardiovascular and metabolic pathologies. Thus, quantitative information about it is of great clinical relevance. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a capable technique that relies on the generation of imaging contrast via the absorption of light and can image at micron-scale resolution. PAI is especially desirable to map microvasculature as hemoglobin strongly absorbs light and can generate a photoacoustic signal. This paper reviews the current state of the art for imaging microvascular networks using photoacoustic imaging. We further describe how quantitative information about blood dynamics such as the total hemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and blood flow rate is obtained using PAI. We also discuss its importance in understanding key pathophysiological processes in neurovascular, cardiovascular, ophthalmic, and cancer research fields. We then discuss the current challenges and limitations of PAI and the approaches that can help overcome these limitations. Finally, we provide the reader with an overview of future trends in the field of PAI for imaging microcirculation.;2022;10.1111/micc.12776
J;Comparison of image registration methods for combining laparoscopic video and spectral image data;Laparoscopic procedures can be assisted by intraoperative modalities, such as quantitative perfusion imaging based on fluorescence or hyperspectral data. If these modalities are not available at video frame rate, fast image registration is needed for the visualization in augmented reality. Three feature-based algorithms and one pre-trained deep homography neural network (DH-NN) were tested for single and multi-homography estimation. Fine-tuning was used to bridge the domain gap of the DH-NN for non-rigid registration of laparoscopic images. The methods were validated on two datasets: an open-source record of 750 manually annotated laparoscopic images, presented in this work, and in-vivo data from a novel laparoscopic hyperspectral imaging system. All feature-based single homography methods outperformed the fine-tuned DH-NN in terms of reprojection error, Structural Similarity Index Measure, and processing time. The feature detector and descriptor ORB1000 enabled video-rate registration of laparoscopic images on standard hardware with submillimeter accuracy.;2022;10.1038/s41598-022-20816-1
J;Deep learning for biomedical photoacoustic imaging: A review;Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a promising emerging imaging modality that enables spatially resolved imaging of optical tissue properties up to several centimeters deep in tissue, creating the potential for numerous exciting clinical applications. However, extraction of relevant tissue parameters from the raw data requires the solving of inverse image reconstruction problems, which have proven extremely difficult to solve. The application of deep learning methods has recently exploded in popularity, leading to impressive successes in the context of medical imaging and also finding first use in the field of PAI. Deep learning methods possess unique advantages that can facilitate the clinical translation of PAI, such as extremely fast computation times and the fact that they can be adapted to any given problem. In this review, we examine the current state of the art regarding deep learning in PAI and identify potential directions of research that will help to reach the goal of clinical applicability.;2021;10.1016/j.pacs.2021.100241
J;Hyperspectral Stimulated Raman Scattering Microscopy Unravels Aberrant Accumulation of Saturated Fat in Human Liver Cancer;Lipid metabolism is dysregulated in human cancers. The analytical tools that could identify and quantitatively map metabolites in unprocessed human tissues with submicrometer resolution are highly desired. Here, we implemented analytical hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering microscopy to map the lipid metabolites in situ in normal and cancerous liver tissues from 24 patients. In contrast to the conventional wisdom that unsaturated lipid accumulation enhances tumor cell survival and proliferation, we unexpectedly visualized substantial amount of saturated fat accumulated in cancerous liver tissues, which was not seen in majority of their adjacent normal tissues. Further analysis by mass spectrometry confirmed significant high levels of glyceryl tripalmitate specifically in cancerous liver. These findings suggest that the aberrantly accumulated saturated fat may have great potential to be a metabolic biomarker for liver cancer.;2018;10.1021/acs.analchem.8b01312
J;Four-color, 4-D time-lapse confocal imaging of chick embryos;"Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that direct cell motility, cell division, and cell shaping has benefited from innovations in cell labeling and the ability to resolve intracellular dynamics with multispectral, high-resolution imaging. However due to difficulties with in vivo cell marking and monitoring, most studies have been restricted to fixed tissue or cells in culture. Here, we report the delivery of multiple (up to four), multicolor fluorescent protein (FP) constructs and four-dimensional (4-D), multispectral time-lapse confocal imaging of cell movements in living chick embryos. Cell cytoskeletal components are fluorescently tagged after microinjection and electroporation of a cocktail of FP constructs into specific regions of chick embryos. We tested I I different FP constructs in various two-, three-, and four-color combinations using multispectral imaging and linear unmixing to limit the crosstalk between different emission spectra. We monitored intracellular dynamics in individual multicolored migrating cells in vivo and developed a set of advantageous imaging parameters for 4-D time-lapse confocal microscopy. We find that the number of four-color labeled cells in a typical embryo is approximately 10% of the total number of fluorescently labeled cells; this value consistently increases showing that approximately 50% of the total labeled cells have only one-color We find that multicolored cells are photostable for time-lapses of approximately 2-3 h. Thus, cell labeling with up to four FP color schemes combined with multispectral, 4-D confocal time-lapse imaging offers a powerful tool to simultaneously analyze cellular and molecular dynamics during chick embryogenesis.";2005;10.2144/000112017
J;The Use of Supercontinuum Laser Sources in Biomedical Diffuse Optics: Unlocking the Power of Multispectral Imaging;Optical techniques based on diffuse optics have been around for decades now and are making their way into the day-to-day medical applications. Even though the physics foundations of these techniques have been known for many years, practical implementation of these technique were hindered by technological limitations, mainly from the light sources and/or detection electronics. In the past 20 years, the developments of supercontinuum laser (SCL) enabled to unlock some of these limitations, enabling the development of system and methodologies relevant for medical use, notably in terms of spectral monitoring. In this review, we focus on the use of SCL in biomedical diffuse optics, from instrumentation and methods developments to their use for medical applications. A total of 95 publications were identified, from 1993 to 2021. We discuss the advantages of the SCL to cover a large spectral bandwidth with a high spectral power and fast switching against the disadvantages of cost, bulkiness, and long warm up times. Finally, we summarize the utility of using such light sources in the development and application of diffuse optics in biomedical sciences and clinical applications.;2021;10.3390/app11104616
J;Clinical photoacoustic/ultrasound dual-modal imaging: Current status and future trends;Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is an emerging biomedical imaging modality that combines optical and ultrasonic imaging, providing overlapping fields of view. This hybrid approach allows for a natural integration of PAT and ultrasound (US) imaging in a single platform. Due to the similarities in signal acquisition and processing, the combination of PAT and US imaging creates a new hybrid imaging for novel clinical applications. Over the recent years, particular attention is paid to the development of PAT/US dual-modal systems highlighting mutual benefits in clinical cases, with an aim of substantially improving the specificity and sensitivity for diagnosis of diseases. The demonstrated feasibility and accuracy in these efforts open an avenue of translating PAT/US imaging to practical clinical applications. In this review, the current PAT/US dual-modal imaging systems are discussed in detail, and their promising clinical applications are presented and compared systematically. Finally, this review describes the potential impacts of these combined systems in the coming future.;2022;10.3389/fphys.2022.1036621
C;Guidance of lymphaticovenous anastomosis using LED-based photoacoustic lymphangiography: A human volunteer study;Lymphedema is abnormal swelling that can develop in the arm, hand, breast, or torso as a side effect of breast cancer surgery (lymph node dissection) and/or radiation therapy. Lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA) is a surgical method of redirecting excess lymphatic fluid into the venous system to improve the lymphatic flow and prevent the recurrence of edema. Before the anastomosis, it is important to identify lymphatic vessels and suitable veins nearby with high resolution and sensitivity to decide on accurate incisions. ICG-enhanced multispectral photoacoustic imaging holds potential in simultaneous visualization of veins and lymphatic vessels, consequently a good candidate for the guidance of LVA. In this work, we explore the potential of a portable LED-based dual-wavelength (820/940 nm) photoacoustic imaging system in 3D visualization of human lymphatic vessels and veins when using ICG as a contrast agent. As a proof-of-principle, we performed a simple phantom experiment using tubes filled with human venous blood and ICG. In addition, we also performed in vivo 2D and 3D imaging experiments after injecting ICG into the subcutaneous tissue of a healthy human volunteer. Our results demonstrate that LED-based photoacoustic imaging system used in this study can visualize and separate lymphatic vessels and veins with high spatial resolution. We believe that these results will have direct and profound impact on photoacoustic-guided LVA procedure and subsequent clinical translation of it.;2022;10.1117/12.2610025
J;Development of a multimodal foveated endomicroscope for the detection of oral cancer;A multimodal endomicroscope was developed for cancer detection that combines hyperspectral and confocal imaging through a single foveated objective and a vibrating optical fiber bundle. Standard clinical examination has a limited ability to identify early stage oral cancer. Optical detection methods are typically restricted by either achievable resolution or a small field-of-view. By combining high resolution and widefield spectral imaging into a single probe, a device was developed that provides spectral and spatial information over a 5 mm field to locate suspicious lesions that can then be inspected in high resolution mode. The device was evaluated on ex vivo biopsies of human oral tumors. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America;2017;10.1364/BOE.8.001525
J;In vivo inflammation mapping of periodontal disease based on diffuse reflectance spectral imaging: a clinical study;Since conventional techniques using periodontal probes have inherent drawbacks in the diagnosis of different grades of gingival inflammation, development of noninvasive screening devices becomes significant. Diffuse reflectance (DR) spectra recorded with white light illumination is utilized to detect periodontal inflammation from the oxygenated hemoglobin absorption ratio R620/R575. A multispectral imaging system is utilized to record narrow-band DR images at 575 and 620 nm from the anterior sextant of the gingivia of 15 healthy volunteers and 25 patients (N = 40). An experienced periodontist assesses the level of gingival inflammation at each site through periodontal probing and assigns diagnosis as healthy, mild, moderate, or severe inflammation. The DR image ratio R620/R575 computed for each pixel (8-mu m resolution) from the monochrome images is pseudo-color-mapped to identify gingival inflammation sites. The DR image ratio values at each site are compared with clinical diagnosis to estimate the specificity and sensitivity of the DR imaging technique in inflammation mapping. The high diagnostic accuracy is utilized to detect underlying inflammation in six patients with a previous history of periodontitis.

J;Quantification of atherosclerotic plaque components using in vivo MRI and supervised classifiers;In this work we aimed to study the possibility of using supervised classifiers to quantify the main components of carotid atherosclerotic plaque in vivo on the basis of multisequence MRI data. MRI data consisting of five MR weightings were obtained from 25 symptomatic subjects. Histological micrographs of endarterectomy specimens from the 25 carotids were used as a standard of reference for training and evaluation. The set of subjects was divided in a training set (12 subjects) and an evaluation set (13 subjects). Four different classifiers and two human MRI readers determined the percentages of calcified tissue, fibrous tissue, lipid core, and intraplaque hemorrhage on the subject level for all subjects in the evaluation set. Quantification of the relatively small amounts of calcium could not be done with statistical significance by either the classifiers or the MRI readers. For the other tissues a simple Bayesian classifier (Bayes) performed better than the other classifiers and the MRI readers. All classifiers performed better than the MRI readers in quantifying the sum of hemorrhage and lipid proportions. The MRI readers overestimated the hemorrhage proportions and tended to underestimate the lipid proportions. In conclusion, this pilot study demonstrates the benefits of algorithmic classifiers for quantifying plaque components.;2006;10.1002/mrm.20828
J;Automatic 3D Nonlinear Registration of Mass Spectrometry Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data;Multimodal integration between mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and radiology-established modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would allow the investigations of key questions in complex biological systems such as the central nervous system. Such integration would provide complementary multiscale data to bridge the gap between molecular and anatomical phenotypes, potentially revealing new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying anatomical pathologies presented on MRI. Automatic coregistration between 3D MSI/MRI is a computationally challenging process due to dimensional complexity, MSI data sparsity, lack of direct spatial-correspondences, and nonlinear tissue deformation. Here, we present a new computational approach based on stochastic neighbor embedding to nonlinearly align 3D MSI to MRI data, identify and reconstruct biologically relevant molecular patterns in 3D, and fuse the MSI datacube to the MRI space. We demonstrate our method using multimodal high-spectral resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) 9.4 T MSI and 7 T in vivo MRI data, acquired from a patient-derived, xenograft mouse brain model of glioblastoma following administration of the EGFR inhibitor drug of Erlotinib. Results show the distribution of some identified molecular ions of the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib, a phosphatidylcholine lipid, and cholesterol, which were reconstructed in 3D and mapped to the MRI space. The registration quality was evaluated on two normal mouse brains using the Dice coefficient for the regions of brainstem, hippocampus, and cortex. The method is generic and can therefore be applied to hyperspectral images from different mass spectrometers and integrated with other established in vivo imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET).;2019;10.1021/acs.analchem.9b00854
J;Spatial and Spectral Imaging of Retinal Laser Photocoagulation Burns;"PURPOSE. To correlate in vivo spatial and spectral morphologic changes of short- to long-pulse 532 nm Nd:YAG retinal laser lesions using Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (FD OCT), autofluorescence (AF), fluorescein angiography (FA), and multispectral imaging. METHODS. Ten eyes with treatment-naive preproliferative or proliferative diabetic retinopathy were studied. A titration grid of laser burns at 20, 100, and 200 milliseconds was applied to the nasal retina and laser fluence titrated to produce four grades of laser lesion visibility: subvisible (SV), barely visible (BV, light-gray), threshold (TH, gray-white), and suprathreshold (ST, white). The AF, FA, FD-OCT, and multispectral imaging were performed 1 week before laser, and 1 hour, 4 weeks, and 3 and 6 months post-laser. Multi-spectral imaging measured relative tissue oxygen concentration. RESULTS. Laser burn visibility and lesion size increased in a linear relationship according to fixed fluence levels. At fixed pulse durations, there was a semilogarithmic increase in lesion size over 6 months. At 20 milliseconds, all grades of laser lesion were reduced significantly in size after 6 months: SV, 51%; BV, 54%; TH, 49%; and ST, 50% (P < 0.001), with retinal pigment epithelial proliferation and photoreceptor infilling. At 20 milliseconds, there was healing of photoreceptor inner segment/outer segment junction layers compared with 100- and 200-millisecond lesions. Significant increases in mean tissue oxygenation (range, four to six units) within the laser titration area and in oxygen concentration across the laser lesions (P < 0.01) were detected at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS. For patients undergoing therapeutic laser, there may be improved tissue oxygenation, higher predictability of burn morphology, and more spatial localization of healing responses of burns at 20 milliseconds compared with longer pulse durations over time.

J;Photoacoustic Imaging for Differential Diagnosis of Benign Polyps versus Malignant Polyps of the Gallbladder: A Preliminary Study;"Objective: To investigate the feasibility of ex vivo multispectral photoacoustic (PA) imaging in differentiating cholesterol versus neoplastic polyps, and benign versus malignant polyps, of the gallbladder. Materials and Methods: A total of 38 surgically confirmed gallbladder polyps (24 cholesterol polyps, 4 adenomas, and 10 adenocarcinomas) from 38 patients were prospectively included in this study. The surgical specimens were set on a gel pad immersed in a saline-filled container. The PA intensities of polyps were then measured, using two separate wavelength intervals (421-647 nm and 692-917 nm). Mann-Whitney U test was performed for the comparison of normalized PA intensities between the cholesterol and neoplastic polyps, and between the benign and malignant polyps. Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted for the comparison of normalized PA intensities among the cholesterol polyps, adenomas, and adenocarcinomas. Results: A significant difference was observed in the normalized PA intensities between the cholesterol and neoplastic polyps at 459 nm (median, 1.00 vs. 0.73; p = 0.032). Comparing the benign and malignant polyps, there were significant differences in the normalized PA intensities at 765 nm (median, 0.67 vs. 0.78; p = 0.013), 787 nm (median, 0.65 vs. 0.77; p = 0.034), and 853 nm (median, 0.59 vs. 0.85; p = 0.028). The comparison of the normalized PA intensities among cholesterol polyps, adenomas, and adenocarcinomas demonstrated marginally significant differences at 765 nm (median, 0.67 vs. 0.66 vs. 0.78, respectively; p = 0.049). Conclusion: These preliminary results indicate that benign versus malignant gallbladder polyps might exhibit different spectral patterns on multispectral PA imaging.";2017;10.3348/kjr.2017.18.5.821
J;Strong Photoacoustic Signal Enhancement by Coating Gold Nanoparticles with Melanin for Biomedical Imaging;Photoacoustics is a powerful biomedical imaging and detection technique, because it is a noninvasive, nonionizing, and low-cost method facilitating deep tissue penetration. However, suitable contrast agents need to be developed to increase the contrast for in vivo imaging. Gold nanoparticles are often discussed as potential sonophores due to their large absorption cross-section and their tunable plasmon resonance. However, disadvantages such as toxicity and low photoacoustic efficiency in the tissue transparency window prevail, preventing their clinical application. As a result, there remains a strong need to develop colloidal photoacoustic contrast agents which absorb in the tissue transparency window, exhibit high photoacoustic signal, and are biocompatible. Here, a facile synthetic approach is presented to produce melanin shells around various gold nanoparticle geometries, from spheres to stars and rods. These hybrid particles show excellent dispersability, better biocompatibility, and augmented photoacoustic responses over the pure melanin or pristine gold particles, with a rod-shape geometry leading to the highest performance. These experimental results are corroborated using numerical calculations and explain the improved photoacoustic performance with a thermal confinement effect. The applicability of melanin coated gold nanorods as gastrointestinal imaging probes in mouse intestine is showcased.;2018;10.1002/adfm.201705607
J;Multispectral optoacoustic tomography to differentiate between lymph node metastases and coronavirus-19 vaccine-associated lymphadenopathy;IntroductionWorldwide mass vaccination for COVID-19 started in late 2020. COVID-19 vaccines cause benign hypermetabolic lymphadenopathies. Clinical stratification between vaccine-associated benign lymphadenopathies and malignant lymphadenopathies through ultrasound, MRI or FDG PET-CT is not feasible. This leads to unnecessary lymph node biopsies, excisions and even radical lymph node dissections. Therefore, to avoid unnecessary surgeries, we assessed whether noninvasive multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) enables a better differentiation between benign and malignant lymphadenopathies. Patients and MethodsAll patients were vaccinated for COVID-19. We used MSOT to image deoxy- and oxyhaemoglobin levels in lymph nodes of tumour patients to assess metastatic status. MSOT imaging results were compared with standard ultrasound and pathological lymph node analysis. We also evaluated the influences of gender, age and time between vaccination and MSOT measurement of lymph nodes on the measured deoxy- and oxyhaemoglobin levels in patients with reactive lymph node changes. ResultsMultispectral optoacoustic tomography was able to identify cancer-free lymph nodes in vivo without a single false negative (33 total lymph nodes), with 100% sensitivity and 50% specificity. A statistically significant higher deoxyhaemoglobin content was detected in patients with tumour manifestations in the lymph node (p = 0.02). There was no statistically significant difference concerning oxyhaemoglobin (p = 0.65). Age, sex and time between vaccination and MSOT measurement had statistically non-significant impact on deoxy- and oxyhaemoglobin levels in patients with reactive lymph nodes. ConclusionHere, we show that MSOT measurement is an advantageous clinical approach to differentiate between vaccine-associated benign lymphadenopathy and malignant lymph node metastases based on the deoxygenation level in lymph nodes.;;10.1111/jdv.18847
J;Modern diagnostic procedures in dermatological oncology;New technologies, such as confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), optical coherence tomography (OCT), electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and multispectral analysis have greatly enriched the possibilities of diagnostics in dermatological oncology. They can be supplementary tools to dermatoscopy and histopathology to make a more precise diagnosis of skin lesions. Increasing relevance of new systems for diagnosis and monitoring of dermatological therapy. Presentation of the technology and the diagnostic range of application for various skin lesions. Presentation of scientifically relevant studies and statistical data, discussion of basic research and expert recommendations. The diagnostic spectrum of dermatological oncology has been significantly enriched in recent years. New technologies, such as CLSM, OCT, EIS and multispectral analysis are non-invasive and therefore painless for the patient. In only a few minutes these techniques deliver valid data and findings and provide dermatologists with more accurate diagnostic information about benign or malignant melanocytic skin lesions or the various forms of white skin cancer. In recent years, non-invasive diagnostic and analytical imaging procedures have been progressively established in dermatological oncology and supplement classical dermatoscopy and histopathology. With respect to the follow-up of different therapeutic modalities unnecessary tissue biopsies and scars can be reduced for patients.;2015;10.1007/s00292-014-2062-4
C;Photo Acoustic Imaging: Technology, Systems and Market Trends;Although the Photo Acoustic effect was observed by Graham Bell in 1880, the first applications (gas analysis) occurred in 1970's using the required energetic light pulses from lasers. During mid 1990's medical imaging research begun to use Photo Acoustic effect and in vivo images were obtained in mid-2000. Since 2009, the number of patent related to Photo Acoustic Imaging (PAI) has dramatically increased. PAI machines for pre-clinical and small animal imaging have been being used in a routine way for several years. Based on its very interesting features (non-ionizing radiation, non-invasive, high depth resolution ratio, scalability, moderate price) and because it is able to deliver not only anatomical, but functional and molecular information, PAI is a very promising clinical imaging modality. It penetrates deeper into tissue than OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) and provides a higher resolution than ultrasounds. The PAI is one of the most growing imaging modality and some innovative clinical systems are planned to be on market in 2017. Our study analyzes the different approaches such as photoacoustic computed tomography, 3D photoacoustic microscopy, multispectral photoacoustic tomography and endoscopy with the recent and tremendous technological progress over the past decade: advances in image reconstruction algorithms, laser technology, ultrasound detectors and miniaturization. We analyze which medical domains and applications are the most concerned and explain what should be the forthcoming medical system in the near future. We segment the market in four parts: Components and R&D, pre-clinical, analytics, clinical. We analyzed what should be, quantitatively and qualitatively, the PAI medical markets in each segment and its main trends. We point out the market accessibility (patents, regulations, clinical evaluations, clinical acceptance, funding). In conclusion, we explain the main market drivers and challenges to overcome and give a road map for medical approved PAI products.;2017;10.1117/12.2254015
J;Monitoring Oxygenation Levels Deep in the Tumor Core: Noninvasive Imaging of Hypoxia, Now in Real-Time 3D;"Understanding the way hypoxia influences tumor biology is important; to study tumor hypoxia, simple and robust quantification of tissue oxygenation levels in vivo is necessary. Real-time noninvasive imaging without the use of expensive large equipment (PET or MRI) is most desirable. Photoacoustic imaging, in the form of volumetric multispectral optoacoustic tomography, as described in this issue of Cancer Research, paves the way for tumor hypoxia studies using an intrinsic optical contrast agent (hemoglobin), up to cm depth and 0.1-mm spatial resolution, in real-time 3D. This approach may find use in the clinic to assess tumor status and therapeutic efficacy.";2019;10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-2151
J;Rh-I-UEA-1 Polymerized Liposomes Target and Image Adenomatous Polyps in the APC(Min/+) Mouse Using Optical Colonography;"Mutated adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) genes predispose transformations to neoplasia, progressing to colorectal carcinoma. Early detection facilitates clinical management and therapy. Novel lectin-mediated polymerized targeted liposomes (Rh-I-UEA-1), with polyp specificity and incorporated imaging agents were fabricated to locate and image adenomatous polyps in APC(Min/+) mice. The biomarker alpha-L-fucose covalently joins the liposomal conjugated lectin Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA-1), via glycosidic linkage to the polyp mucin layer. Multispectral optical imaging (MSI) corroborated a global perspective of specific binding (rhodamine B 532 nm emission, 590-620 nm excitation) of targeted Rh-I-UEA-1 polymerized liposomes to polyps with 1.4-fold labeling efficiency. High-resolution coregistered optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescence molecular imaging (FMI) reveal the spatial correlation of contrast distribution and tissue morphology. Freshly excised APC(Min) bowels were incubated with targeted liposomes (UEA-1 lectin), control liposomes (no lectin), or iohexol (Omnipaque) and imaged by the three techniques. Computed tomographic quantitative analyses did not confirm that targeted liposomes more strongly bound polyps than nontargeted liposomes or iohexol (Omnipaque) alone. OCT, with anatomic depth capabilities, along with the coregistered FMI, substantiated Rh-I-UEA-1 liposome binding along the mucinous polyp surface. UEA-1 lectin denotes alpha-L-fucose biomarker carbohydrate expression at the mucin glycoprotein layer; Rh-I-UEA-1 polymerized liposomes target and image adenomatous polyps in APC(Min) mice.";2011;10.2310/7290.2010.00054
J;Automated quantification of bioluminescence images;We developed a computer-aided analysis tool for quantitatively determining bioluminescent reporter distributions inside small animals. The core innovations are a body-fitting animal shuttle and a statistical mouse atlas, both of which are spatially aligned and scaled according to the animal's weight, and hence provide data congruency across animals of varying size and pose. In conjunction with a multispectral bioluminescence tomography technique capitalizing on the spatial framework of the shuttle, the in vivo biodistribution of luminescent reporters can rapidly be calculated and, thus, enables operator-independent and computer-driven data analysis. We demonstrate its functionality by quantitatively monitoring a bacterial infection, where the bacterial organ burden was determined and validated with the established serial-plating method. In addition, the statistical mouse atlas was validated and compared to existing techniques providing an anatomical reference. The proposed data analysis tool promises to increase data throughput and data reproducibility and accelerate human disease modeling in mice.;2018;10.1038/s41467-018-06288-w
J;Quantitative Visualization and Detection of Skin Cancer Using Dynamic Thermal Imaging;In 2010 approximately 68,720 melanomas will be diagnosed in the US alone, with around 8,650 resulting in death(1). To date, the only effective treatment for melanoma remains surgical excision, therefore, the key to extended survival is early detection(2,3). Considering the large numbers of patients diagnosed every year and the limitations in accessing specialized care quickly, the development of objective in vivo diagnostic instruments to aid the diagnosis is essential. New techniques to detect skin cancer, especially non-invasive diagnostic tools, are being explored in numerous laboratories. Along with the surgical methods, techniques such as digital photography, dermoscopy, multispectral imaging systems (MelaFind), laser-based systems (confocal scanning laser microscopy, laser doppler perfusion imaging, optical coherence tomography), ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, are being tested. Each technique offers unique advantages and disadvantages, many of which pose a compromise between effectiveness and accuracy versus ease of use and cost considerations. Details about these techniques and comparisons are available in the literature(4). Infrared (IR) imaging was shown to be a useful method to diagnose the signs of certain diseases by measuring the local skin temperature. There is a large body of evidence showing that disease or deviation from normal functioning are accompanied by changes of the temperature of the body, which again affect the temperature of the skin(5,6). Accurate data about the temperature of the human body and skin can provide a wealth of information on the processes responsible for heat generation and thermoregulation, in particular the deviation from normal conditions, often caused by disease. However, IR imaging has not been widely recognized in medicine due to the premature use of the technology(7,8) several decades ago, when temperature measurement accuracy and the spatial resolution were inadequate and sophisticated image processing tools were unavailable. This situation changed dramatically in the late 1990s-2000s. Advances in IR instrumentation, implementation of digital image processing algorithms and dynamic IR imaging, which enables scientists to analyze not only the spatial, but also the temporal thermal behavior of the skin(9), allowed breakthroughs in the field. In our research, we explore the feasibility of IR imaging, combined with theoretical and experimental studies, as a cost effective, non-invasive, in vivo optical measurement technique for tumor detection, with emphasis on the screening and early detection of melanoma(10-13). In this study, we show data obtained in a patient study in which patients that possess a pigmented lesion with a clinical indication for biopsy are selected for imaging. We compared the difference in thermal responses between healthy and malignant tissue and compared our data with biopsy results. We concluded that the increased metabolic activity of the melanoma lesion can be detected by dynamic infrared imaging.;2011;10.3791/2679
C;Optoacoustic detection of 3D microstructures in deep tissue-mimicking phantoms;The emerging research field of functional micro devices and microbots aims at developing remote-controlled microsensors and actuators that can operate inside living organisms for biomedical applications. However, a significant gap remains in controlling with high accuracy such microdevices in complex environments. This is primarily due to the lack of high spatial and temporal resolution techniques. Here we demonstrate the detection of synthetic microstructures with sizes between 10 and 50 mu m size, in deep tissue-mimicking phantoms, using multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT). When referring to guidance/propulsion, cargo-delivery, and imaging capabilities, these microstructures represent key components of the physical, chemical and biohybrid microbots. They are conceived for diverse in vivo medical applications, including non-invasive diagnosis and therapy.;2019;
J;Simulated Gastric Digestion and In Vivo Intestinal Uptake of Orally Administered CuO Nanoparticles and TiO2 E171 in Male and Female Rat Pups;Oral exposure to nanoparticles (NPs) during early life is an understudied area. The goals of this study were to evaluate the effect of pre-weaned rat gastric fluids on 50 nm CuO NPs and TiO2 E171 in vitro, and to evaluate uptake in vivo. The NP uptake was studied in vivo in male and female Sprague-Dawley rat pups following oral administration of four consecutive daily doses of 10 mg/kg CuO NPs, TiO2 E171, or vehicle control (water) between postnatal day (PND) 7-10. Rat pups were sacrificed on either PND10 or PND21. Simulated digestion led to dissolution of CuO NPs at the later ages tested (PND14 and PND21, but not PND7). In vivo intestinal uptake of CuO NPs and TiO2 E171 was observed by hyperspectral imaging of intestinal cross sections. Brightfield microscopy showed that the number of immune cells increased in the intestinal tissue following NP administration. Orally administered NPs led to low intestinal uptake of NPs and an increase in immune cells in the small and large intestine, suggesting that oral exposure to NPs during early life may lead to irritation or a low-grade inflammation. The long-term impact of increased immune cells in the intestinal tract during early life is unknown.;2021;10.3390/nano11061487
C;A method for atlas-based volumetric registration with surface constraints for Optical Bioluminescence Tomography in small animal imaging;Atlases are normalized representations of anatomy that can provide a standard coordinate system for in vivo imaging studies. For Optical Bioluminescence Tomography (OBT) in small animals, the animal's surface topography can be reconstructed from structured light measurements, but internal anatomy is unavailable unless additional CT or MR images are acquired. We present a novel method for estimating the internal organ structure of a mouse by warping a labeled 3D volumetric mouse atlas with the constraint that the surfaces of the two should match. Surface-constrained harmonic maps used for this bijective warping are computed by minimizing the covariant harmonic energy. We demonstrate the application of this warping scheme in OBT, where scattering and absorption coefficients of tissue are functions of the internal anatomy and hence, better estimates of the organ structures can lead to a more accurate forward model resulting in improved source localization. We first estimated the subject's internal geometry using the atlas-based warping scheme. Then the mouse was tessellated and optical properties were assigned based on the estimated organ structure. Bioluminescent sources were simulated, an optical forward model was computed using a finite-element solver, and multispectral data were simulated. We evaluate the accuracy of the forward model computed using the warped atlas against that assuming a homogeneous mouse model. This is done by comparing each model against a 'true' optical forward model where the anatomy of the mouse is assumed known. We also evaluate the impact of anatomical alignment on bioluminescence source localization.;2007;10.1117/12.710197
J;Photoacoustic clinical imaging;Photoacoustic is an emerging biomedical imaging modality, which allows imaging optical absorbers in the tissue by acoustic detectors (light in - sound out). Such a technique has an immense potential for clinical translation since it allows high resolution, sufficient imaging depth, with diverse endogenous and exogenous contrast, and is free from ionizing radiation. In recent years, tremendous developments in both the instrumentation and imaging agents have been achieved. These opened avenues for clinical imaging of various sites allowed applications such as brain functional imaging, breast cancer screening, diagnosis of psoriasis and skin lesions, biopsy and surgery guidance, the guidance of tumor therapies at the reproductive and urological systems, as well as imaging tumor metastases at the sentinel lymph nodes. Here we survey the various clinical and pre-clinical literature and discuss the potential applications and hurdles that still need to be overcome.;2019;10.1016/j.pacs.2019.05.001
J;Multiscale optical and optoacoustic imaging of amyloid-beta deposits in mice;Large-field multifocal illumination fluorescence microscopy and panoramic volumetric multispectral optoacoustic tomography can be combined to longitudinally assess amyloid-beta deposits in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Deposits of amyloid-beta (A beta) in the brains of rodents can be analysed by invasive intravital microscopy on a submillimetre scale, or via whole-brain images from modalities lacking the resolution or molecular specificity to accurately characterize A beta pathologies. Here we show that large-field multifocal illumination fluorescence microscopy and panoramic volumetric multispectral optoacoustic tomography can be combined to longitudinally assess A beta deposits in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. We used fluorescent A beta-targeted probes (the luminescent conjugated oligothiophene HS-169 and the oxazine-derivative AOI987) to transcranially detect A beta deposits in the cortex of APP/PS1 and arcA beta mice with single-plaque resolution (8 mu m) and across the whole brain (including the hippocampus and the thalamus, which are inaccessible by conventional intravital microscopy) at sub-150 mu m resolutions. Two-photon microscopy, light-sheet microscopy and immunohistochemistry of brain-tissue sections confirmed the specificity and regional distributions of the deposits. High-resolution multiscale optical and optoacoustic imaging of A beta deposits across the entire brain in rodents thus facilitates the in vivo study of A beta accumulation by brain region and by animal age and strain.;2022;10.1038/s41551-022-00906-1
J;Multispectral Depth-Resolved Fluorescence Lifetime Spectroscopy Using SPAD Array Detectors and Fiber Probes;Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) arrays are increasingly exploited and have demonstrated potential in biochemical and biomedical research, both for imaging and single-point spectroscopy applications. In this study, we explore the application of SPADs together with fiber-optic-based delivery and collection geometry to realize fast and simultaneous single-point time-, spectral-, and depth-resolved fluorescence measurements at 375 nm excitation light. Spectral information is encoded across the columns of the array through grating-based dispersion, while depth information is encoded across the rows thanks to a linear arrangement of probe collecting fibers. The initial characterization and validation were realized against layered fluorescent agarose-based phantoms. To verify the practicality and feasibility of this approach in biological specimens, we measured the fluorescence signature of formalin-fixed rabbit aorta samples derived from an animal model of atherosclerosis. The initial results demonstrate that this detection configuration can report fluorescence spectral and lifetime contrast originating at different depths within the specimens. We believe that our optical scheme, based on SPAD array detectors and fiber-optic probes, constitute a powerful and versatile approach for the deployment of multidimensional fluorescence spectroscopy in clinical applications where information from deeper tissue layers is important for diagnosis.;2019;10.3390/s19122678
J;EGFP-EGF1 protein-conjugated PEG-PLA nanoparticles for tissue factor targeted drug delivery;In a strategy for anti-thrombotic therapy, we have expressed EGFP-EGF1 fusion protein, in which EGF1 can bind with tissue factor (TF). EGFP has previously been widely used as a fluorescent protein marker. EGFP-EGF1 protein was thiolated and conjugated to the malemide covering on the pegylated nanoparticles (NP) to form the EGFP-EGF1-NP. The EGFP-EGF1-NP was characterized in terms of morphology, size and zeta potential. In vitro cell viability experiment confirmed that the biodegradable EGFP-EGF1-NP was safe. To evaluate the delivering ability of EGFP-EGF1-NP, a fluorochrome dye, Dir, was incorporated into the nanoparticle, and the loading capacity and release property of the particle were examined. In vitro results showed that the binding ability of EGFP-EGF1-NP with IF-expressing cells was significantly stronger than that of non-conjugated NP. In vivo multispectral fluorescent imaging demonstrated that EGFP-EGF1-NP had high specificity and sensitivity in targeting thrombi. Our study demonstrated that EGFP-EGF1-NP is a promising IF-targeting drug delivery system for thrombolytic treatment. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J;Multispectral nanoparticle contrast agents for true-color spectroscopic optical coherence tomography;We have recently developed a novel dual window scheme for processing spectroscopic OCT images to provide spatially resolved true color imaging of chromophores in scattering samples. Here we apply this method to measure the extinction spectra of plasmonic nanoparticles at various concentrations for potential in vivo applications. We experimentally demonstrate sub-nanomolar sensitivity in the measurement of nanoparticle concentrations, and show that colorimetric imaging with multiple species of nanoparticles produces enhanced contrast for spectroscopic OCT in both tissue phantom and cell studies.

J;Long-Term Risk Assessment for Medical Application of Cold Atmospheric Pressure Plasma;Despite increasing knowledge gained based on multidisciplinary research, plasma medicine still raises various questions regarding specific effects as well as potential risks. With regard to significant statements about in vivo applicability that cannot be prognosticated exclusively based on in vitro data, there is still a deficit of clinical data. This study included a clinical follow-up of five probands who had participated five years previously in a study on the influence of cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAP) on the wound healing of CO2 laser-induced skin lesions. The follow-up included a complex imaging diagnostic involving dermatoscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI). Hyperspectral analysis showed no relevant microcirculatory differences between plasma-treated and non-plasma-treated areas. In summary of all the findings, no malignant changes, inflammatory reactions or pathological changes in cell architecture could be detected in the plasma-treated areas. These unique in vivo long-term data contribute to a further increase in knowledge about important safety aspects in regenerative plasma medicine. However, to confirm these findings and secure indication-specific dose recommendations, further clinical studies are required.;2020;10.3390/diagnostics10040210
J;Coherent Raman Scattering Unravelling Mechanisms Underlying Skull Optical Clearing for Through-Skull Brain Imaging;Optical access of a mouse brain using microscopes is the key to study brain structures and functions in vivo. However, the opaque skull of a mouse has to be either opened or thinned in an invasive way to attain an adequate imaging depth in the brain. Mild skull optical clearing is highly desired, but its chemical mechanism is far from being understood. Here, we unraveled the molecular process underlying optical clearing of the mouse skull by label-free hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, thereby discovering the optimal clearing strategy to turn a turbid skull into a transparent skull window. Furthermore, we demonstrated in vivo three-photon imaging of vascular structures as deep as 850 mu m in the cortex of the mouse brain. Coherent Raman based microspectroscopy holds great promise to advance skull and tissue clearing methods in the future.;2019;10.1021/acs.analchem.9b02624
J;Targeted Imaging of VCAM-1 mRNA in a Mouse Model of Laser-Induced Choroidal Neovascularization Using Antisense Hairpin-DNA-Functionalized Gold-Nanoparticles;Mouse laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (mouse LCNV) recapitulates the wet form of human age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) is a known inflammatory biomarker, and it increases in the choroidal neovascular tissues characteristic of this experimental model. We have designed and constructed gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with hairpin-DNA that incorporates an antisense sequence complementary to VCAM-1 mRNA (AS-VCAM-1 hAuNPs) and tested them as optical imaging probes. The 3' end of the hairpin is coupled to a near-infrared fluorophore that is quenched by the AuNP surface via Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Hybridization of the antisense sequence to VCAM-1 mRNA displaces the fluorophore away from the AuNP surface, inducing fluorescent activity. In vitro testing showed that hAuNPs hybridize to an exogenous complementary oligonucleotide within a pH range of 4.5-7.4, and that they are stable at reduced pH. LCNV mice received tail-vein injections of AS-VCAM-1 hAuNPs. Hyperspectral imaging revealed the delivery of AS-VCAM-1 hAuNPs to excised choroidal tissues. Fluorescent images of CNV lesions were obtained, presumably in response to the hybridization of AS-hAuNPs to LCNV-induced VCAM-1 mRNA. This is the first demonstration of systemic delivery of hAuNPs to ocular tissues to facilitate mRNA imaging of any target.;2018;10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00661
J;Optical and magnetic resonance imaging as complementary modalities in drug discovery;Imaging has the ability to study various biological and chemical processes noninvasively in living subjects in a longitudinal way. For this reason, imaging technologies have become an integral part of the drug-discovery and development program and are commonly used in following disease processes and drug action in both preclinical and clinical stages. As the domain of imaging sciences transitions from anatomical/functional to molecular applications, the development of molecular probes becomes crucial for the advancement of the field. This review summarizes the role of two complementary techniques, magnetic resonance and fluorescence optical imaging, in drug discovery. While the first approach exploits intrinsic tissue characteristics as the source of image contrast, the second necessitates the use of appropriate probes for signal generation. The anatomical, functional, metabolic and molecular information that becomes accessible through imaging can provide invaluable insights into disease mechanisms and mechanisms of drug action.;2010;10.4155/FMC.09.175
J;Epi-detecting label-free multimodal imaging platform using a compact diode-pumped femtosecond solid-state laser;We have developed an epi-detected multimodal nonlinear optical microscopy platform based on a compact and cost-effective laser source featuring simultaneous acquisition of signals arising from hyperspectral coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), two-photon fluorescence, and second harmonic generation. The laser source is based on an approach using a frequency-doubled distributed Bragg reflector-tapered diode laser to pump a femtosecond Ti: sapphire laser. The operational parameters of the laser source are set to the optimum trade-off between the spectral and temporal requirements for these three modalities, achieving sufficient spectral resolution for CARS in the lipid region. The experimental results on a biological tissue reveal that the combination of the epi-detection scheme and the use of a compact diode-pumped femtosecond solid-state laser in the nonlinear optical microscope is promising for biomedical applications in a clinical environment.

J;Assessing spectral imaging of the human finger for detection of arthritis;Rheumatoid arthritis causes changes in the optical properties of tissues in the joints, which could be detected using spectral imaging. This has the potential for development of low cost, non-contact method for early detection of the disease. In this work, hyperspectral imaging system was used to obtain 24 images of proximal interphalangeal joints of 12 healthy volunteers. A large inter-subject variability was observed, but still an increase in transmittance in the spectral range of 600 nm - 950 nm could be associated to the joint in all images. The results of experiments were compared to detailed simulations of light propagation trough tissue. For the simulations, voxelized 3D models of unaffected and inflamed human joints with realistic tissue distributions were constructed from an in-vivo MRI scan of a healthy human finger. The simulated model of healthy finger successfully reproduced the experimental data, while the affected models indicated that the inflammation introduces detectable differences in the spectral and spatial features. The results were used to guide the design of a dedicated imaging system for detection of rheumatoid arthritis, that will be used in an upcoming clinical study.

J;Parametric level set reconstruction methods for hyperspectral diffuse optical tomography;A parametric level set method (PaLS) is implemented for image reconstruction for hyperspectral diffuse optical tomography (DOT). Chromophore concentrations and diffusion amplitude are recovered using a linearized Born approximation model and employing data from over 100 wavelengths. The images to be recovered are taken to be piecewise constant and a newly introduced, shape-based model is used as the foundation for reconstruction. The PaLS method significantly reduces the number of unknowns relative to more traditional level-set reconstruction methods and has been show to be particularly well suited for ill-posed inverse problems such as the one of interest here. We report on reconstructions for multiple chromophores from simulated and experimental data where the PaLS method provides a more accurate estimation of chromophore concentrations compared to a pixel-based method.

J;Insights into photoacoustic speckle and applications in tumor characterization;In ultrasound imaging, fully-developed speckle arises from the spatiotemporal superposition of pressure waves backscattered by randomly distributed scatterers. Speckle appearance is affected by the imaging system characteristics (lateral and axial resolution) and the random-like nature of the underlying tissue structure. In this work, we examine speckle formation in acoustic-resolution photoacoustic (PA) imaging using simulations and experiments. Numerical and physical phantoms were constructed to demonstrate that PA speckle carries information related to unresolved absorber structure in a manner similar to ultrasound speckle and unresolved scattering structures. A fractal-based model of the tumor vasculature was used to study PA speckle from unresolved cylindrical vessels. We show that speckle characteristics and the frequency content of PA signals can be used to monitor changes in average vessel size, linked to tumor growth. Experimental validation on murine tumors demonstrates that PA speckle can be utilized to characterize the unresolved vasculature in acoustic-resolution photoacoustic imaging.;2019;10.1016/j.pacs.2019.02.002
J;Vibrational imaging for label-free cancer diagnosis and classification;The first key step in the detection and classification of most cancers is the microscopic assessment of thin tissue slices, the so-called histopathology. This procedure is still nowadays, similarly to 150 years ago, performed by staining the tissue with two or more dyes able to bind to specific biological structures, followed by visual inspection by the histopathologist under the bright-field optical microscope. This approach involves long manual procedures which can be accompanied by human errors, subjectivity, and lack of reproducibility. Vibrational microscopies are capable of directly providing chemical and biomolecular information on tissues, identifying them through their fingerprint vibrational spectra without the need of staining and, thus, constitute powerful tools for label-free and objective tumour identification. The two most established techniques, spontaneous Raman microscopy and infrared absorption microscopy, suffer, respectively, from long acquisition times and low spatial resolution. These limitations can be overcome by novel and more technically demanding approaches such coherent Raman scattering and photothermal infrared microscopy. Here we present an extended overview of the major advances in the field of vibrational imaging for cancer diagnosis. We start from a detailed description of the different technologies and then present examples of their applications to tissue imaging for cancer assessment. We critically compare the presented approaches, discussing the steps required to bring these powerful technologies from bench to bedside.;2022;10.1007/s40766-021-00027-6
J;Tryptophan autofluorescence imaging of neoplasms of the human colon;Detection of flat neoplasia is a major challenge in colorectal cancer screening, as missed lesions can lead to the development of an unexpected 'incident' cancer prior to the subsequent endoscopy. The use of a tryptophan-related autofluorescence has been reported to be increased in murine intestinal dysplasia. The emission spectra of cells isolated from human adenocarcinoma and normal mucosa of the colon were studied and showed markedly greater emission intensity from cancerous cells compared to cells obtained from the surrounding normal mucosa. A proto-type multispectral imaging system optimized for ultraviolet macroscopic imaging of tissue was used to obtain autofluorescence images of surgical specimens of colonic neoplasms and normal mucosa after resection. Fluorescence images did not display the expected greater emission from the tumor as compared to the normal mucosa, most probably due to increased optical absorption and scattering in the tumors. Increased fluorescence intensity in neoplasms was observed however, once fluorescence images were corrected using reflectance images. Tryptophan fluorescence alone may be useful in differentiating normal and cancerous cells, while in tissues its autofluorescence image divided by green reflectance may be useful in displaying neoplasms.

J;A new method for the in vivo volumetric measurement of the human hippocampus with high neuroanatomical accuracy;"Accurate and reproducible in vivo measurement of hippocampal volumes using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is complicated by the morphological complexity of the structure. Additionally, separation of certain parts of the hippocampus from the adjacent brain structures on MR images is sometimes very difficult. These difficulties have led most investigators to either use arbitrary landmarks or to exclude certain parts Of the structure from their measurements. Eased on three-dimensional MR data, we have developed a reliable in vivo volumetric measurement of the human hippocampus. In contrast to most of the previously described volumetric MR-based methods,; we aimed to sample the entire hippocampal formation using its true anatomical definition. This was accomplished by relying on the capacity of the BRAINS software to simultaneously visualize in multiple planes, to telegraph tracings or cursor position from one plane to another, and to simultaneously rely on multispectral data from three different image sets (T1, T2, and tissue classified). The methods for identifying boundaries. and measuring the hippocampal volume are described. The method has excellent reliability, sensitivity, and specificity. The method may be,of use in studies of structure-function relationships in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, temporal lobe epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease. Future work will use these measurements as training data for a neural net-based technique to identify the anatomical boundaries automatically. Hippocampus 2000;10:752-758.

J;Application of optical and spectroscopic technologies for the characterization of carious lesions in vitro;The detection of the beginning demineralization process of dental hard tissue remains a challenging task in dentistry. As an alternative to bitewing radiographs, optical and spectroscopic technologies showed promising results for caries diagnosis. The aim of the present work is to give an overview of optical and spectroscopic properties of healthy and carious human teeth in vitro by means of Raman spectroscopy (RS), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI). OCT was able to represent microstructural changes below the enamel surface and revealed increased scattering for white spot lesions and a white scattering trail for deeper lesions. HSI showed similar absorbance characteristics for healthy and demineralized enamel over the entire spectrum and a characteristic absorbance peak at 550 nm for discolored lesions. Already at early carious stages (white spot), we found a distinct loss of hydroxylapatite-related intensity at 959 cm(-1) in demineralized regions with RS. Healthy and demineralized tooth surfaces can be distinguished at different signal levels by means of RS, OCT and HSI. The presented modalities provide additional information to the current clinical diagnosis of caries such as microstructural changes, quantification of the demineralization and imaging of caries-related chemical changes.;2018;10.1515/bmt-2017-0133
J;Simultaneous multi-color optical sectioning fluorescence microscopy with wavelength-coded volume holographic gratings;Optical sectioning fluorescence microscopy provides high contrast images of volumetric samples and has been widely used for many biological applications. However, simultaneously acquiring multi-color fluorescence images require additional optical elements and devices, which are bulky, wavelength specific, and not cost-effective. In this paper, wavelength-coded volume holographic gratings (WC-VHGs) based optical sectioning fluorescence microscopy is proposed to simultaneously offer multi-color fluorescence images with fine out-of-focus background rejection. Due to wavelength degeneracy, multiplexed WC-VHGs are capable of acquiring multi-wavelength fluorescence images in a single shot, and displaying the laterally separated multi-wavelength images onto CCD. In our system optical sectioning capability is achieved through speclde illumination and HiLo imaging method. To demonstrate imaging characteristics of our system, dual-wavelength fluorescence images of both standard fluorescent microspheres and ex vivo mT/mG mice cardiac tissue are presented. Current results may find important applications in hyperspectral imaging for biomedical research.

J;Clinical photoacoustic imaging platforms;"Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a new promising medical imaging technology available for diagnosing and assessing various pathologies. PAI complements existing imaging modalities by providing information not currently available for diagnosing, e.g., oxygenation level of the underlying tissue. Currently, researchers are translating PAI from benchside to bedside to make unique clinical advantages of PAI available for patient care. The requirements for a successful clinical PAI system are; deeper imaging depth, wider field of view, and faster scan time than the laboratory-level PAI systems. Currently, many research groups and companies are developing novel technologies for data acquisition/signal processing systems, detector geometry, and an acoustic sensor. In this review, we summarize state-of-the-art clinical PAI systems with three types of the imaging transducers: linear array transducer, curved linear array transducer, and volumetric array transducer. We will also discuss the limitations of the current PAI systems and describe latest techniques being developed to address these for further enhancing the image quality of PAI for successful clinical translation.";2018;10.1007/s13534-018-0062-7
J;Spectrally resolved bioluminescence tomography with adaptive finite element analysis: methodology and simulation;As a molecular imaging technique, bioluminescence tomography (BLT) withits highly sensitive detection and facile operation can significantly reveal molecular and cellular information in vivo at the whole-body small animal level. However, because of complex photon transportation in biological tissue and boundary detection data with high noise, bioluminescent sources in deeper positions generally cannot be localized. In our previous work, we used achromatic or monochromatic measurements and an a priori permissible source region strategy to develop a multilevel adaptive finite-element algorithm. In this paper, we propose a spectrally solved tomographic algorithm with a posteriori permissible source region selection. Multispectral measurements, and anatomical and optical information first deal with the nonuniqueness of BLT and constrain the possible solution of source reconstruction. The use of adaptive mesh refinement and permissible source region based on a posteriori measures not only avoids the dimension disaster arising from the multispectral measured data but also reduces the ill-posedness of BLT and therefore improves the reconstruction quality. Reconsideration of the optimization method and related modifications further enhance reconstruction robustness and efficiency. We also incorporate into the method some improvements for reducing computational burdens. Finally, using a whole-body virtual mouse phantom, we demonstrate the capability of the proposed BLT algorithm to reconstruct accurately bioluminescent sources in deeper positions. In terms of optical property errors and two sources of discernment in deeper positions, this BLT algorithm represents the unique predominance for BLT reconstruction.;2007;10.1088/0031-9155/52/15/009
J;In vivo delivery of small interfering RNA to tumors and their vasculature by novel dendritic nanocarriers;New targets for RNA interference (RNAi)based cancer therapy are constantly emerging from the increasing knowledge on key molecular pathways that are paramount for carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, in vivo delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) remains a crucial challenge for therapeutic success. siRNAs on their own are not taken up by most mammalian cells in a way that preserves their activity. Moreover, when applied in vivo, siRNA-based approaches are all limited by poor penetration into the target tissue and low silencing efficiency. To circumvent these limitations, we have developed novel polymerized polyglycerol-based dendrimer core shell structures to deliver siRNA to tumors in vivo. These cationic dendrimers can strongly improve the stability of the siRNA, its intracellular trafficking, its silencing efficacy, and its accumulation in the tumor environment owing to the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Here, we show that our dendritic nanocarriers exhibited low cytotoxicity and high efficacy in delivering active siRNA into cells. With use of human glioblastoma and murine mammary adenocarcinoma cell lines as model systems, these siRNA-dendrimer polyplexes silenced the luciferase gene, ectopically overexpressed in these cells. Importantly, significant gene silencing was accomplished in vivo within 24 h of treatment with our luciferase siRNA-nanocarrier polyplexes, as measured by noninvasive intravital bioluminescence imaging. Moreover, our siRNA-nanocarriers show very low levels of toxicity as no significant weight loss was observed after intravenous administration of the polyplexes. We show a proof of concept for siRNA delivery in vivo using a luciferase-based model. We predict that in vivo silencing of important cell growth and angiogenesis regulator genes in a selective manner will justify this approach as a successful anticancer therapy.-Ofek, P., Fischer, W., Calderon, M., Haag, R., Satchi-Fainaro, R.

J;Nondestructive assessment of collagen hydrogel cross-linking using time-resolved autofluorescence imaging;We investigate the use of a fiber-based, multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) system to nondestructively monitor changes in mechanical properties of collagen hydrogels caused by controlled application of widely used cross-linking agents, glutaraldehyde (GTA) and ribose. Postcross-linking, fluorescence lifetime images are acquired prior to the hydrogels being processed by rheological or tensile testing to directly probe gel mechanical properties. To preserve the sterility of the ribose-treated gels, FLIm is performed inside a biosafety cabinet (BSC). A pairwise correlation analysis is used to quantify the relationship between mean hydrogel fluorescence lifetimes and the storage or Young's moduli of the gels. In the GTA study, we observe strong and specific correlations between fluorescence lifetime and the storage and Young's moduli. Similar correlations are not observed in the ribose study and we postulate a reason for this. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of FLIm to longitudinally monitor dynamic cross-link formation. The strength of the GTA correlations and deployment of our fiber-based FLIm system inside the aseptic environment of a BSC suggests that this technique may be a valuable tool for the tissue engineering community where longitudinal assessment of tissue construct maturation in vitro is highly desirable.

J;The use of optical spectroscopy for in vivo detection of cervical pre-cancer;In order to investigate the effectiveness of optical spectroscopy for in vivo diagnosis of cervical pre-cancerous conditions, a series of published studies are surveyed. The six optical technologies investigated include fluorescence spectroscopy, reflectance spectroscopy, and their combination using point probe or multispectral imaging approaches. Searching in the well-known databases, the most recent published works were sought out. Various aspects of the studies were evaluated including the details of the technology used, the pathologic threshold for tissue classification and the gold standard, the study population and prevalence of disease in this population, the method of measurement, the number of clinicians involved in the study, the classification and validation algorithms, and the performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity and, when available, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Forty-four studies conducted from 1994 to 2012 were evaluated. The data are gathered in two comprehensive tables, and five illustrations are provided to simplify a comparison between studies from different points of view. There is a broad band of studies from small pilot studies through phase III clinical trials. Among the reviewed articles, only three factors were found to influence the performance of the optical spectroscopy studies. Multispectral approaches show higher specificity than the point probe approaches (p = 0.001). The use of acetic acid before measurement and prevalence of disease among the studied population, also, have an impact on the sensitivity and specificity of the studies (p < 0.05), respectively.;2014;10.1007/s10103-013-1288-3
J;Tuning Optical Properties of BODIPY Dyes by Pyrrole Conjugation for Photoacoustic Imaging;Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is increasingly employed in (pre-) clinical research, thus, development of suitable contrast agents, in particular fluorescence-quenched chromophores, for PAI is of high importance. Small molecule dyes are appropriate due to favorable circulation, excretion properties, and ease of conjugation to targeting moieties. The BODIPY chromophores have been widely used in bioimaging, yet they are not ideal for PAI due to high fluorescence. Hence, here nonfluorescent BODIPY are designed by 1H-pyrrole conjugation (PyBODIPY) to apply as probes for PAI. The PyBODIPYs exhibit absorption maxima up to 800 nm, and PA signal could be detected in concentrations of 1 nmol mL(-1) and 35 pmol mm(-3), by tube and tissue phantom, respectively. In addition to nonfluorescent, PyBODIPYs are non-phototoxic, photostable, and show high molar extinction coefficients, as well as inertness toward nucleophilic addition. PyBODIPYs are modified with PEG-400, to improve aqueous solubility and to enable in vivo imaging. Thus, PyBODIPY is an attractive small molecule to use as PA contrast agent, which could be coupled to targeting ligands for in vivo use. In addition, 1H-pyrrole conjugation might be applied to the design of novel near-infrared ranged quenchers suitable for PAI, and promote the development of probes for clinical translation.;2020;10.1002/adom.201902115
J;Preclinical imaging methods for assessing the safety and efficacy of regenerative medicine therapies;Regenerative medicine therapies hold enormous potential for a variety of currently incurable conditions with high unmet clinical need. Most progress in this field to date has been achieved with cell-based regenerative medicine therapies, with over a thousand clinical trials performed up to 2015. However, lack of adequate safety and efficacy data is currently limiting wider uptake of these therapies. To facilitate clinical translation, non-invasive in vivo imaging technologies that enable careful evaluation and characterisation of the administered cells and their effects on host tissues are critically required to evaluate their safety and efficacy in relevant preclinical models. This article reviews the most common imaging technologies available and how they can be applied to regenerative medicine research. We cover details of how each technology works, which cell labels are most appropriate for different applications, and the value of multi-modal imaging approaches to gain a comprehensive understanding of the responses to cell therapy in vivo.;2017;10.1038/s41536-017-0029-9
C;Near infrared spectroscopy system for quantitative monitoring of renal hemodynamics and oxygenation in rats;Regulation of renal hemodynamics and oxygenation is complex and its detailed understanding is crucial to improve therapeutic procedures for kidney diseases like acute kidney injury. For the challenging task of monitoring renal hemodynamics and oxygenation in rats, we designed a continuous wave (cw) multispectral near-infrared spectroscopy setup. A fiber probe with a source fiber and eight detection fibers is placed on the ventral surface of the exposed rat kidney in vivo, and an additional source fiber is positioned on the dorsal surface. Nine wavelengths from 658 nm to 1060 nm are used to have sufficient redundancy for reliable quantification of hemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, and tissue water content. To investigate both, the surface layer and deeper tissues, the setup alternates between reflection and transmission at a rate of 10 Hz. Our system relies on spatially resolved reflection and transmission, and multispectral analysis to differentiate absorption from scattering. Monte-Carlo Simulations for a layered tissue structure are used as a model for quantitative characterization of the renal cortex and medulla. Renal parameters are monitored during baseline conditions and during dedicated pathophysiologically relevant interventions including arterial occlusion and changes of inspiratory gas mixture. Together with invasive probes, which monitor arterial blood pressure, renal perfusion and tissue oxygenation, a detailed picture of renal hemodynamics and oxygenation in several pathophysiological conditions is acquired. This detailed information can serve as a quantitative reference to other methods such as MRI.;2019;10.1117/12.2507371
C;PIR-fiber spectroscopy with FTIR and TDL spectrometers in the middle infrared range of spectra;Development of Polycrystalline Infrared (PIR-) fibers extruded from solid solutions of AgCl/AgBr has opened a new horizon of molecular spectroscopy applications in 4-18 micron range of spectra. PIR-fiber cables and probes could be coupled with a variety of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and Tunable Diode Lasers (TDL), including pig tailing of Mercury Cadmium Tellurium (MCT) detectors. Using these techniques no sample preparation is necessary for PIR-fiber probes to measure reflection and absorption spectra, in situ, in vivo, in real time and even multiplexed. Such PIR-fiber probes have been used for evanescent absorption spectroscopy of malignant tissue and skin surface diagnostics in-vivo, glucose detection in blood as well as crude oil composition analysis, for organic pollution and nuclear waste monitoring. A review of various PIR-fiber applications in medicine, industry and environment control is presented. The synergy of PIR-fibers flexibility with a super high spectral resolution of TDL spectrometers with Deltav=10(-4) cm(-1), provides the unique tool for gas analysis, specifically when PIR-fibers are coupled as pigtails with MCT-detectors and Pb-salt lasers. Design of multichannel PIR-fiber tailed TDL spectrometer could be used as a portable device for multispectral gas analysis at 1ppb level of detectivity for various applications in medicine and biotechnology.;2000;
J;Estimation of optoacoustic contrast agent concentration with self-calibration blind logarithmic unmixing;Chromophore quantification in optoacoustic tomography is challenging due to signal contributions from strongly absorbing background tissue chromophores and the depth-dependent light attenuation. Herein we present a procedure capable of correcting for wavelength-dependent light fluence variations using a logarithmic representation of the images taken at different wavelengths assisted with a blind unmixing approach. It is shown that the serial expansion of the logarithm of an optoacoustic image contains a term representing the ratio between absorption of the probe of interest and other background components. Under assumptions of tissue-like background absorption variations, this term can be readily isolated with an unmixing algorithm, attaining quantitative maps of photo-absorbing agent distribution.;2014;10.1088/0031-9155/59/17/4785
J;Dual ifgMosaic: A Versatile Method for Multispectral and Combinatorial Mosaic Gene-Function Analysis;"Improved methods for manipulating and analyzing gene function have provided a better understanding of how genes work during organ development and disease. Inducible functional genetic mosaics can be extraordinarily useful in the study of biological systems; however, this experimental approach is still rarely used in vertebrates. This is mainly due to technical difficulties in the assembly of large DNA constructs carrying multiple genes and regulatory elements and their targeting to the genome. In addition, mosaic phenotypic analysis, unlike classical single gene-function analysis, requires clear labeling and detection of multiple cell clones in the same tissue. Here, we describe several methods for the rapid generation of transgenic or gene-targeted mice and embryonic stem (ES) cell lines containing all the necessary elements for inducible, fluorescent, and functional genetic mosaic (ifgMosaic) analysis. This technology enables the interrogation of multiple and combinatorial gene function with high temporal and cellular resolution.";2017;10.1016/j.cell.2017.07.031
J;RETRACTED: Optically and acoustically triggerable sub-micron phase-change contrast agents for enhanced photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging (Retracted Article);We demonstrate a versatile phase-change sub-micron contrast agent providing three modes of contrast enhancement: 1) photoacoustic imaging contrast, 2) ultrasound contrast with optical activation, and 3) ultrasound contrast with acoustic activation. This agent, which we name 'Cy-droplet', has the following novel features. It comprises a highly volatile perfluorocarbon for easy versatile activation, and a near-infrared optically absorbing dye chosen to absorb light at a wavelength with good tissue penetration. It is manufactured via a 'microbubble condensation' method. The phase-transition of Cy-droplets can be optically triggered by pulsed-laser illumination, inducing photoacoustic signal and forming stable gas bubbles that are visible with echo-ultrasound in situ. Alternatively, Cy-droplets can be converted to microbubble contrast agents upon acoustic activation with clinical ultrasound. Potentially all modes offer extravascular contrast enhancement because of the sub-micron initial size. Such versatility of acoustic and optical 'triggerability' can potentially improve multi-modality imaging, molecularly targeted imaging and controlled drug release. (C) 2017 The Authors.

J;Potential Applications of Photoacoustic Imaging in Early Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment;Photoacoustic imaging technique overcomes the strong scattering effects of light when transmitting in organisms by detecting the ultrasonic signals based on the photoacoustic effect, which avoids the limitations of low depth of traditional optical imaging and low contrast of acoustic imaging. This technique has potential applications in early cancer diagnosis and it can possibly become an effective method for tumor diagnosis, locating, staging and treating. The principle of photoacoustic imaging and the research status of its clinical applications in early cancer diagnosis and treatment at home and abroad arc mainly described.

J;Copper Manganese Sulfide Nanoplates: A New Two-Dimensional Theranostic Nanoplatform for MRI/MSOT Dual-Modal Imaging-Guided Photothermal Therapy in the Second Near-Infrared Window;Multifunctional nanoplatforms with integrated diagnostic and therapeutic functions have attracted tremendous attention. Especially, the second near-infrared (NIR-II) light response-based nanoplatforms hold great potential in cancer theranostic applications, which is because the NIR-II window provides larger tissue penetration depth and higher maximum permissible exposure (MPE) than that of the well-studied first near-infrared (NIR-I) window. Herein, we for the first time present a two-dimensional (2D)-nanoplatform based on Cu2MnS2 nanoplates (NPs) for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) dual-modal imaging-guided photothermal therapy (PTT) of cancer in the NIR-II window. Methods: Cu2MnS2 NPs were synthesized through a facile and environmentally friendly process. A series of experiments, including the characterization of Cu2MnS2 NPs, the long-term toxicity of Cu2MnS2 NPs in BALB/c nude mice, the applications of Cu2MnS2 NPs for in vitro and in vivo MRI/MSOT dual-modal imaging and NIR-II PTT of cancer were carried out. Results: The as-synthesized Cu2MnS2 NPs exhibit low cytotoxicity, excellent biocompatibility as well as high photothermal conversion efficiency (similar to 49.38%) and outstanding photostability. Together with their good T-1-shortening effect and strong absorbance in the NIR-I and NIR-II region, the Cu2MnS2 NPs display high-contrast imaging performance both in MRI and MSOT (900 nm laser source). Moreover, the subsequent in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that the Cu2MnS2 NPs possess excellent PTT efficacy under 1064 nm laser irradiation with a low power density (0.6 W cm(-2)). In addition, the detailed long-term toxicity studies further confirming the safety of Cu2MnS2 NPs in vivo. Conclusion: We have developed a new 2D Cu2MnS2 NPs as multifunctional theranostic agents for MRI/MSOT dual-modal imaging-guided PTT of cancer in the NIR-II window. Such biocompatible Cu2MnS2 NPs might provide a new perspective for exploring new 2D-based nanoplatforms with improved properties for clinical applications in the future.;2017;10.7150/thno.21694
J;When cells divide: Label-free multimodal spectral imaging for exploratory molecular investigation of living cells during cytokinesis;In vivo, molecular-level investigation of cytokinesis, the climax of the cell cycle, not only deepens our understanding of how life continues, but it will also open up new possibilities of diagnosis/prognosis of cancer cells. Although fluorescence-based methods have been widely employed to address this challenge, they require a fluorophore to be designed for a specific known biomolecule and introduced into the cell. Here, we present a label-free spectral imaging approach based on multivariate curve resolution analysis of Raman hyperspectral data that enables exploratory untargeted studies of mammalian cell cytokinesis. We derived intrinsic vibrational spectra and intracellular distributions of major biomolecular components (lipids and proteins) in dividing and nondividing human colon cancer cells. In addition, we discovered an unusual autofluorescent lipid component that appears predominantly in the vicinity of the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. This autofluorescence signal could be utilized as an endogenous probe for monitoring and visualizing cytokinesis in vivo.;2015;10.1038/srep17541
J;Emerging imaging technologies in dermatology Part I: Basic principles;"Dermatologists rely primarily on clinical examination in combination with histopathology to diagnose conditions; however, clinical examination alone might not be sufficient for accurate diagnosis and skin biopsies have associated morbidity. With continued technological advancement, there are emerging ancillary imaging technologies available to dermatologists to aid in diagnosis and management. This 2-part review article will discuss these emerging technologies including: digital photographic imaging, confocal microscopy, optical coherence tomography, and high-frequency ultrasound, as well as several additional modalities in development. In this first installment, the authors describe the breadth of technologies available and the science behind them.

J;Biomedical Applications of Translational Optical Imaging: From Molecules to Humans;Light is a powerful investigational tool in biomedicine, at all levels of structural organization. Its multitude of features (intensity, wavelength, polarization, interference, coherence, timing, non-linear absorption, and even interactions with itself) able to create contrast, and thus images that detail the makeup and functioning of the living state can and should be combined for maximum effect, especially if one seeks simultaneously high spatiotemporal resolution and discrimination ability within a living organism. The resulting high relevance should be directed towards a better understanding, detection of abnormalities, and ultimately cogent, precise, and effective intervention. The new optical methods and their combinations needed to address modern surgery in the operating room of the future, and major diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration are reviewed here, with emphasis on our own work and highlighting selected applications focusing on quantitation, early detection, treatment assessment, and clinical relevance, and more generally matching the quality of the optical detection approach to the complexity of the disease. This should provide guidance for future advanced theranostics, emphasizing a tighter coupling-spatially and temporally-between detection, diagnosis, and treatment, in the hope that technologic sophistication such as that of a Mars rover can be translationally deployed in the clinic, for saving and improving lives.;2021;10.3390/molecules26216651
J;Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping Using a Multispectral Autoregressive Moving Average Model to Assess Hepatic Iron Overload;Background R2*-MRI is clinically used to noninvasively assess hepatic iron content (HIC) to guide potential iron chelation therapy. However, coexisting pathologies, such as fibrosis and steatosis, affect R2* measurements and may thus confound HIC estimations. Purpose To evaluate whether a multispectral auto regressive moving average (ARMA) model can be used in conjunction with quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) to measure magnetic susceptibility as a confounder-free predictor of HIC. Study Type Phantom study and in vivo cohort. Subjects Nine iron phantoms covering clinically relevant R2* range (20-1200/second) and 48 patients (22 male, 26 female, median age 18 years). Field Strength/Sequence Three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) multi-echo gradient echo (GRE) at 1.5 T. Assessment ARMA-QSM modeling was performed on the complex 3D GRE signal to estimate R2*, fat fraction (FF), and susceptibility measurements. R2*-based dry clinical HIC values were calculated from the 2D GRE acquisition using a published R2*-HIC calibration curve as reference standard. Statistical Tests Linear regression analysis was performed to compare ARMA R2* and susceptibility-based estimates to iron concentrations and dry clinical HIC values in phantoms and patients, respectively. Results In phantoms, the ARMA R2* and susceptibility values strongly correlated with iron concentrations (R-2 >= 0.9). In patients, the ARMA R2* values highly correlated (R-2 = 0.97) with clinical HIC values with slope = 0.026, and the susceptibility values showed good correlation (R-2 = 0.82) with clinical dry HIC values with slope = 3.3 and produced a dry-to-wet HIC ratio of 4.8. Data Conclusion This study shows the feasibility that ARMA-QSM can simultaneously estimate susceptibility-based wet HIC, R2*-based dry HIC and FFs from a single multi-echo GRE acquisition. Our results demonstrate that both, R2* and susceptibility-based wet HIC values estimated with ARMA-QSM showed good association with clinical dry HIC values with slopes similar to published R2*-biopsy HIC calibration and dry-to-wet tissue weight ratio, respectively. Hence, our study shows that ARMA-QSM can provide potentially confounder-free assessment of hepatic iron overload. Level of Evidence 3 Technical Efficacy Stage 2;2021;10.1002/jmri.27584
J;Multiparametric fat-water separation method for fast chemical-shift imaging guidance of thermal therapies;Purpose: A k-means-based classification algorithm is investigated to assess suitability for rapidly separating and classifying fat/water spectral peaks from a fast chemical shift imaging technique for magnetic resonance temperature imaging. Algorithm testing is performed in simulated mathematical phantoms and agar gel phantoms containing mixed fat/water regions. Methods: Proton resonance frequencies (PRFs), apparent spin-spin relaxation (T2*) times, and T1-weighted (T1-W) amplitude values were calculated for each voxel using a single-peak autoregressive moving average (ARMA) signal model. These parameters were then used as criteria for k-means sorting, with the results used to determine PRF ranges of each chemical species cluster for further classification. To detect the presence of secondary chemical species, spectral parameters were recalculated when needed using a two-peak ARMA signal model during the subsequent classification steps. Mathematical phantom simulations involved the modulation of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), maximum PRF shift (MPS) values, analysis window sizes, and frequency expansion factor sizes in order to characterize the algorithm performance across a variety of conditions. In agar, images were collected on a 1.5T clinical MR scanner using acquisition parameters close to simulation, and algorithm performance was assessed by comparing classification results to manually segmented maps of the fat/water regions. Results: Performance was characterized quantitatively using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), sensitivity, and specificity. The simulated mathematical phantom experiments demonstrated good fat/water separation depending on conditions, specifically high SNR, moderate MPS value, small analysis window size, and low but nonzero frequency expansion factor size. Physical phantom results demonstrated good identification for both water (0.997 +/- 0.001, 0.999 +/- 0.001, and 0.986 +/- 0.001 for DSC, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively) and fat (0.763 +/- 0.006, 0.980 +/- 0.004, and 0.941 +/- 0.002 for DSC, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively). Temperature uncertainties, based on PRF uncertainties from a 5 x 5-voxel ROI, were 0.342 and 0.351 degrees C for pure and mixed fat/water regions, respectively. Algorithm speed was tested using 25 x 25-voxel and whole image ROIs containing both fat and water, resulting in average processing times per acquisition of 2.00 +/- 0.07 s and 146 +/- 1 s, respectively, using uncompiled MATLAB scripts running on a shared CPU server with eight Intel Xeon (TM) E5640 quad-core processors (2.66 GHz, 12 MB cache) and 12 GB RAM. Conclusions: Results from both the mathematical and physical phantom suggest the k-means-based classification algorithm could be useful for rapid, dynamic imaging in an ROI for thermal interventions. Successful separation of fat/water information would aid in reducing errors from the non-temperature sensitive fat PRF, as well as potentially facilitate using fat as an internal reference for PRF shift thermometry when appropriate. Additionally, the T1-W or R2* signals may be used for monitoring temperature in surrounding adipose tissue. (C) 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.;2013;10.1118/1.4819815
J;Comparison of permissible source region and multispectral data using efficient bioluminescence tomography method;As a novel molecular imaging technology, bioluminescence tomography (BLT) has become an important tool for biomedical research in recent years, which can perform a quantitative reconstruction of an internal light source distribution with the scattered and transmitted bioluminescent signals measured on the external surface of a small animal. However, BLT is severely ill-posed because of complex photon propagation in the biological tissue and limited boundary measured data with noise. Therefore, sufficient a priori knowledge should be fused for the uniqueness and stability of BLT solution. Permissible source region strategy and spectrally resolved measurements are two kinds of a priori knowledge commonly used in BLT reconstruction. This paper compares their performance with simulation and in vivo heterogeneous mouse experiments. In order to improve the efficiency of large-scale source restoration, this paper introduces an efficient iterative shrinkage thresholding method that not only has faster convergence rate but also has better reconstruction accuracy than the modified Newton-type optimization approach. Finally, a discussion of these two kinds of a priori knowledge is given based on the comparison results.;2011;10.1002/jbio.201100049

J;Optical Access to Arteriovenous Cerebral Microcirculation Through a Transparent Cranial Implant;Background and Objective Microcirculation plays a critical role in physiologic processes and several disease states. Laser speckle imaging (LSI) is a full-field, real-time imaging technique capable of mapping microvessel networks and providing relative flow velocity within the vessels. In this study, we demonstrate that LSI combine with multispectral reflectance imaging (MSRI), which allows for distinction between veins and arteries in the vascular flow maps produced by LSI. We apply this combined technique to mouse cerebral vascular network in vivo, comparing imaging through the skull, to the dura mater and brain directly through a craniectomy, and through a transparent cranial Window to the Brain (WttB) implant. Study Design/Materials and Methods The WttB implant used in this study is made of a nanocrystalline Yttria-Stabilized-Zirconia ceramic. MSRI was conducted using white-light illumination and filtering the reflected light for 560, 570, 580, 590, 600, and 610 nm. LSI was conducted using an 810 nm continuous wave near-infrared laser with incident power of 100 mW, and the reflected speckle pattern was captured by a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera. Results Seven vessel branches were analyzed and comparison was made between imaging through the skull, craniectomy, and WttB implant. Through the skull, MSRI did not detect any vessels, and LSI could not image microvessels. Imaging through the WttB implant, MSRI was able to identify veins versus arteries, and LSI was able to image microvessels with only slightly higher signal-to-noise ratio and lower sharpness than imaging the brain through a craniectomy. Conclusions This study demonstrates the ability to perform MSRI-LSI across a transparent cranial implant, to allow for cerebral vascular networks to be mapped, including microvessels. These images contain additional information such as vein-artery separation and relative blood flow velocities, information which is of value scientifically and medically. The WttB implant provides substantial improvements over imaging through the murine cranial bone, where microvessels are not visible and MSRI cannot be performed. Lasers Surg. Med.

J;Multispectral photoacoustic microscopy of lipids using a pulsed supercontinuum laser;We demonstrate optical resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) of lipid-rich tissue between 1050-1714 nm using a pulsed supercontinuum laser based on a large-mode-area photonic crystal fiber. OR-PAM experiments of lipid-rich samples show the expected optical absorption peaks near 1210 and 1720 nm. These results show that pulsed supercontinuum lasers are promising for OR-PAM applications such as label-free histology of lipid-rich tissue and imaging small animal models of disease.

J;Multispectral fluorine-19 MRI enables longitudinal and noninvasive monitoring of tumor-associated macrophages;High-grade gliomas, the most common and aggressive primary brain tumors, are characterized by a complex tumor microenvironment (TME). Among the immune cells infiltrating the glioma TME, tumor-associated microglia and macrophages (TAMs) constitute the major compartment. In patients with gliomas, increased TAM abundance is associated with more aggressive disease. Alterations in TAM phenotypes and functions have been reported in preclinical models of multiple cancers during tumor development and after therapeutic interventions, including radiotherapy and molecular targeted therapies. These findings indicate that it is crucial to evaluate TAM abundance and dynamics over time. Current techniques to quantify TAMs in patients rely mainly on histological staining of tumor biopsies. Although informative, these techniques require an invasive procedure to harvest the tissue sample and typically only result in a snapshot of a small region at a single point in time. Fluorine isotope 19 MRI (F-19 MRI) represents a powerful means to noninvasively and longitudinally monitor myeloid cells in pathological conditions by intravenously injecting perfluorocarbon-containing nanoparticles (PFC-NP). In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility and power of F-19 MRI in preclinical models of gliomagenesis, breast-to-brain metastasis, and breast cancer and showed that the major cellular source of F-19 signal consists of TAMs. Moreover, multispectral F-19 MRI with two different PFC-NP allowed us to identify spatially and temporally distinct TAM niches in radiotherapy-recurrent murine gliomas. Together, we have imaged TAMs noninvasively and longitudinally with integrated cellular, spatial, and temporal resolution, thus revealing important biological insights into the critical functions of TAMs, including in disease recurrence.;2022;10.1126/scitranslmed.abo2952
J;High-Throughput Cell Imaging and Classification by Narrowband and Low-Spectral-Resolution Raman Microscopy;We investigated the use of narrowband Raman spectra for rapid label-free molecular imaging aimed at cell classification using principal component regression and linear discriminant analysis. In the classification of breast non-tumorigenic epithelial and cancer cell lines, the classification accuracies using a spectral range of 100 cm(-1) were equivalent to or better than that with using the fingerprint and high-wavenumber regions. Narrowing the Raman spectral range for analysis allows reduction of the charge-coupled device (CCD) pixels required for spectrum detection, resulting in the improvement of image acquisition speed with adequate classification accuracy. Our measurements revealed that the wavenumber region at 1397-1501 cm(-1) can provide molecular information sufficient for cell classification without causing notable errors in the baseline-correction. A spectral resolution of similar to 9 cm(-1) was found to be sufficient to provide high accuracy in cell classification, which allowed us to apply pixel binning at the CCD readout for further acceleration of the imaging speed. As a result, the acquisition time for a 1200 X 1500 pixels Raman hyperspectral image at 1397-1501 cm(-1) was reduced to 21 min. Under this condition, different cell lines were classified at accuracies higher than 90%. The presented approach will improve throughput of cell and tissue analysis and classification using Raman spectroscopy and extend practical uses of Raman imaging in biology and medicine.;2019;10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b11295
C;End-to-End Neural Network for Feature Extraction and Cancer Diagnosis of In Vivo Fluorescence Lifetime Images of Oral Lesions;In contrast to previous studies that focused on classical machine learning algorithms and hand-crafted features, we present an end-to-end neural network classification method able to accommodate lesion heterogeneity for improved oral cancer diagnosis using multispectral autofluorescence lifetime imaging (maFLIM) endoscopy. Our method uses an autoencoder framework jointly trained with a classifier designed to handle overfitting problems with reduced databases, which is often the case in healthcare applications. The autoencoder guides the feature extraction process through the reconstruction loss and enables the potential use of unsupervised data for domain adaptation and improved generalization. The classifier ensures the features extracted are task-specific, providing discriminative information for the classification task. The data-driven feature extraction method automatically generates task-specific features directly from fluorescence decays, eliminating the need for iterative signal reconstruction. We validate our proposed neural network method against support vector machine (SVM) baselines, with our method showing a 6.5%-8.3% increase in sensitivity. Our results show that neural networks that implement data-driven feature extraction provide superior results and enable the capacity needed to target specific issues, such as inter-patient variability and the heterogeneity of oral lesions.;2021;10.1109/EMBC46164.2021.9629739
J;Video rate optoacoustic tomography of mouse kidney perfusion;Optoacoustic tomography can visualize optical contrast in tissues while capitalizing on the advantages of ultrasound, such as high spatial resolution and fast imaging capabilities.

J;Retinal choroidal vessel imaging based on multi-wavelength fundus imaging with the guidance of optical coherence tomography;"A multispectral fundus camera (MSFC), as a novel noninvasive technology, uses an extensive range of monochromatic light sources that enable the view of different sectional planes of the retinal and choroidal structures. However, MSFC imaging involves complex processes affected by various factors, and the recognized theory based on light absorption above the choroid is not sufficient. In an attempt to supplement the relevant explanations, in this study, we used optical coherence tomography (OCT), a three-dimensional tomography modality, to analyze MSFC results at the retina and choroid. The swept-source OCT system at 1060 nm wavelength with a 200 kHz A-scan rate and an MSFC with 11 bands at 470 to 845 nm are employed. A quantitative evaluation procedure is proposed to compare MSFC and OCT en face images. The comparative study shows that 1) the MSFC images with the illumination wavelength of less than 605 nm could mainly provide the retinal structure information; 2) Relative choroidal layer thickness information could be inferred from the MSFC images, especially the image acquiring under the wavelength more than 605 nm. According to the results, further investigation revealed the contribution of the perivascular tissue and the sclera scattering in the difference of vascular brightness in MSFC images.

J;In Vivo Bioluminescence Tomography Center of Mass-Guided Conformal Irradiation;Purpose: The cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)-guided small animal radiation research platform (SARRP) has provided unique opportunities to test radiobiologic hypotheses. However, CBCT is less adept to localize soft tissue targets growing in a low imaging contrast environment. Three-dimensional bioluminescence tomography (BLT) provides strong image contrast and thus offers an attractive solution. We introduced a novel and efficient BLT-guided conformal radiation therapy and demonstrated it in an orthotopic glioblastoma (GBM) model. Methods and Materials: A multispectral BLT system was integrated with SARRP for radiation therapy (RT) guidance. GBM growth curve was first established by contrast CBCT/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to derive equivalent sphere as approximated gross target volume (aGTV). For BLT, mice were subject to multispectral bioluminescence imaging, followed by SARRP CBCT imaging and optical reconstruction. The CBCT image was acquired to generate anatomic mesh for the reconstruction and RT planning. To ensure high accuracy of the BLT-reconstructed center of mass (CoM) for target localization, we optimized the optical absorption coefficients mu(a) by minimizing the distance between the CoMs of BLT reconstruction and contrast CBCT/MRI-delineated GBM volume. The aGTV combined with the uncertainties of BLT CoM localization and target volume determination was used to generate estimated target volume (ETV). For conformal irradiation procedure, the GBM was first localized by the predetermined ETV centered at BLT-reconstructed CoM, followed by SARRP radiation. The irradiation accuracy was qualitatively confirmed by pathologic staining. Results: Deviation between CoMs of BLT reconstruction and contrast CBCT/MRI-imaged GBM is approximately 1 mm. Our derived ETV centered at BLT-reconstructed CoM covers >95% of the tumor volume. Using the second-week GBM as an example, the ETV-based BLT-guided irradiation can cover 95.4% +/- 4.7% tumor volume at prescribed dose. The pathologic staining demonstrated the BLT-guided irradiated area overlapped well with the GBM location. Conclusions: The BLT-guided RT enables 3-dimensional conformal radiation for important orthotopic tumor models, which provides investigators a new preclinical research capability.

J;Low-cost photoacoustic imaging systems based on laser diode and light-emitting diode excitation;Photoacoustic imaging, an emerging biomedical imaging modality, holds great promise for preclinical and clinical researches. It combines the high optical contrast and high ultrasound resolution by converting laser excitation into ultrasonic emission. In order to generate photoacoustic signal eficiently, bulky Q-switched solid-state laser systems are most commonly used as excitation sources and hence limit its commercialization. As an alternative, the miniaturized semiconductor laser system has the advantages of being inexpensive, compact, and robust, which makes a significant er effect on production-forming design. It is also desirable to obtain a wavelength in a wide range from visible to near-infrared spectrum for multispectral applications. Focussing on practical aspect, this paper reviews the state-of-the-art developments of low-cost photoacoustic system with laser diode and light-emitting diode excitation source and highlights a few representative installations in the past decade.;2017;10.1142/S1793545817300038
J;Gas plasma-spurred wound healing is accompanied by regulation of focal adhesion, matrix remodeling, and tissue oxygenation;In response to injury, efficient migration of skin cells to rapidly close the wound and restore barrier function requires a range of coordinated processes in cell spreading and migration. Gas plasma technology produces therapeutic reactive species that promote skin regeneration by driving proliferation and angiogenesis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating gas plasma-aided cell adhesion and matrix remodeling essential for wound closure remain elusive. Here, we combined in vitro analyses in primary dermal fibroblasts isolated from murine skin with in vivo studies in a murine wound model to demonstrate that gas plasma treatment changed phosphorylation of signaling molecules such as focal adhesion kinase and paxillin a in adhesion-associated complexes. In addition to cell spreading and migration, gas plasma exposure affected cell surface adhesion receptors (e.g., integrin alpha 5 beta 1, syndecan 4), structural proteins (e.g., vinculin, talin, actin), and transcription of genes associated with differentiation markers of fibroblasts-to-myofibroblasts and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cellular protrusions, fibronectin fibrillogenesis, matrix metabolism, and matrix metalloproteinase activity. Finally, we documented that gas plasma exposure increased tissue oxygenation and skin perfusion during ROS-driven wound healing. Altogether, these results provide critical insights into the molecular machinery of gas plasma-assisted wound healing mechanisms.;2021;10.1016/j.redox.2020.101809
J;Robustness of diffuse reflectance spectra analysis by inverse adding doubling algorithm;Analysing diffuse reflectance spectra to extract properties of biological tissue requires modelling of light transport within the tissue, considering its absorption, scattering, and geometrical properties. Due to the layered skin structure, skin tissue models are often divided into multiple layers with their associated optical properties. Typically, in the analysis, some model parameters defining these properties are fixed to values reported in the literature to speed up the fitting process and improve its performance. In the absence of consensus, various studies use different approaches in fixing the model parameters. This study aims to assess the effect of fixing various model parameters in the skin spectra fitting process on the accuracy and robustness of a GPU-accelerated two-layer inverse adding-doubling (IAD) algorithm. Specifically, the performance of the IAD method is determined for noiseless simulated skin spectra, simulated spectra with different levels of noise applied, and in-vivo measured reflectance spectra from hyperspectral images of human hands recorded before, during, and after the arterial occlusion. Our results suggest that fixing multiple parameters to a priori known values generally improves the robustness and accuracy of the IAD algorithm for simulated spectra. However, for in-vivo measured spectra, these values are unknown in advance and fixing optical parameters to incorrect values significantly deteriorates the overall performance. Therefore, we propose a method to improve the fitting performance by pre-estimating model parameters. Our findings could be considered in all future research involving the analysis of diffuse reflectance spectra to extract optical properties of skin tissue.

J;Mapping of neuroinflammation-induced hypoxia in the spinal cord using optoacoustic imaging;Recent studies suggest that metabolic changes and oxygen deficiency in the central nervous system play an important role in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS). In our present study, we investigated the changes in oxygenation and analyzed the vascular perfusion of the spinal cord in a rodent model of MS. We performed multispectral optoacoustic tomography of the lumbar spinal cord before and after an oxygen enhancement challenge in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for MS. In addition, mice were transcardially perfused with lectin to label the vasculature and their spinal columns were optically cleared, followed by light sheet fluorescence microscopy. To analyze the angioarchitecture of the intact spine, we used VesSAP, a novel deep learning-based framework. In EAE mice, the spinal cord had lower oxygen saturation and hemoglobin concentration compared to healthy mice, indicating compromised perfusion of the spinal cord. Oxygen administration reversed hypoxia in the spinal cord of EAE mice, although the ventral region remained hypoxic. Additionally, despite the increased vascular density, we report a reduction in length and complexity of the perfused vascular network in EAE. Taken together, these findings highlight a new aspect of neuroinflammatory pathology, revealing a significant degree of hypoxia in EAE in vivo that is accompanied by changes in spinal vascular perfusion. The study also introduces optoacoustic imaging as a tractable technique with the potential to further decipher the role of hypoxia in EAE and to monitor it in MS patients.;2022;10.1186/s40478-022-01337-4
J;Uncertainty-Aware Organ Classification for Surgical Data Science Applications in Laparoscopy;Objective: Surgical data science is evolving into a research field that aims to observe everything occurring within and around the treatment process to provide situation-aware data-driven assistance. In the context of endoscopic video analysis, the accurate classification of organs in the field of view of the camera proffers a technical challenge. Herein, we propose a new approach to anatomical structure classification and image tagging that features an intrinsic measure of confidence to estimate its own performance with high reliability and which can be applied to both RGB and multispectral imaging (MI) data. Methods: Organ recognition is performed using a superpixel classification strategy based on textural and reflectance information. Classification confidence is estimated by analyzing the dispersion of class probabilities. Assessment of the proposed technology is performed through a comprehensive in vivo study with seven pigs. Results: When applied to image tagging, mean accuracy in our experiments increased from 65% (RGB) and 80% (MI) to 90% (RGB) and 96% (MI) with the confidence measure. Conclusion: Results showed that the confidence measure had a significant influence on the classification accuracy, and MI data are better suited for anatomical structure labeling than RGB data. Significance: This paper significantly enhances the state of art in automatic labeling of endoscopic videos by introducing the use of the confidence metric, and by being the first study to use MI data for in vivo laparoscopic tissue classification. The data of our experiments will be released as the first in vivo MI dataset upon publication of this paper.;2018;10.1109/TBME.2018.2813015
J;Vital-dye enhanced fluorescence imaging of GI mucosa: metaplasia, neoplasia, inflammation;"Background: Confocal endomicroscopy has revolutionized endoscopy by offering subcellular images of the GI epithelium; however, the field of view is limited. Multiscale endoscopy platforms that use widefield imaging are needed to better direct the placement of high-resolution probes. Design: Feasibility study. Objective: This study evaluated the feasibility of a single agent, proflavine hemisulfate, as a contrast medium during both widefield and high-resolution imaging to characterize the morphologic changes associated with a variety of GI conditions. Setting: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, and Mount Sinai Media Center, New York, New York. Patients, Interventions, and Main Outcome Measurements: Resected specimens were obtained from 15 patients undergoing EMR, esophagectomy, or colectomy. Proflavine hemisulfate, a vital fluorescent dye, was applied topically. The specimens were imaged with a widefield multispectral microscope and a high-resolution microendoscope. The images were compared with histopathologic examination. Results: Widefield fluorescence imaging enhanced visualization of morphology, including the presence and spatial distribution of glands, glandular distortion, atrophy, and crowding. High-resolution imaging of widefield abnormal areas revealed that neoplastic progression corresponded to glandular heterogeneity and nuclear crowding in dysplasia, with glandular effacement in carcinoma. These widefield and high-resolution image features correlated well with the histopathologic features. Limitations: This imaging approach must be validated in vivo with a larger sample size. Conclusions: Multiscale proflavine-enhanced fluorescence imaging can delineate epithelial changes in a variety of GI conditions. Distorted glandular features seen with widefield imaging could serve as a critical bridge to high-resolution probe placement. An endoscopic platform combining the two modalities with a single vital dye may facilitate point-of-care decision making by providing real-time, in vivo diagnoses.";2012;10.1016/j.gie.2011.10.004
J;Rod-shape MSN@MoS2 Nanoplatform for FL/MSOT/CT Imaging-Guided Photothermal and Photodynamic Therapy;Rod-shape nanoplatform have received tremendous attention owing to their enhanced ability for cell internalization and high capacity for drug loading. MoS2, widely used in electronic devices, electrocatalysis, sensor and energy-storage, has been studied as photothermal agents over the years. However, the efficacy of rod-shape MoS2 based photothermal agents for photothermal therapy has not been studied before. Here, a near-infrared (NIR) light-absorbing MoS2 nanosheets coated mesoporous silica nanorods with human serum albumin (HSA) modifying and Ce6 loading (MSNR@MoS2-HSA/Ce6) were constructed for combined photothermal and photodynamic therapy. Methods: The near-infrared (NIR) light was used to trigger the synergistic anti-tumor therapy. In addition, breast cancer cell line was applied to evaluate the in vitro anti-tumor activity. The multi-modal imaging capacity and tumor-killing efficiency of the designed nanocomposites in vivo was also demonstrated with the 4T1 tumor-bearing mouse model. Results: These nanocomposites could not only perform NIR light triggered photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), but also achieve in vivo fluorescence (FL) /multispectral optical tomography (MSOT)/X-ray computed tomography (CT) triple-model bioimaging. What's more, the rod-shape nanoplatform could be endowed with better anti-tumor ability based on the EPR effect and HSA-mediated active tumor targeting. At the same time, the hyperthermia generated by MoS2 could synergistically improve the PDT effect with the acceleration of the blood flow, leading to the increase of the oxygen level in tumor tissue. Conclusion: MSNR@MoS2-HSA/Ce6 proves to be a promising multi-functional nanoplatform for effective treatment of tumor.;2019;10.7150/thno.32715
J;Clinical label-free endoscopic imaging of biochemical and metabolic autofluorescence biomarkers of benign, precancerous, and cancerous oral lesions;"Early detection is critical for improving the survival rate and quality of life of oral cancer patients; unfortunately, dysplastic and early-stage cancerous oral lesions are often difficult to distinguish from oral benign lesions during standard clinical oral examination. Therefore, there is a critical need for novel clinical technologies that would enable reliable oral cancer screening. The autofluorescence properties of the oral epithelial tissue provide quantitative information about morphological, biochemical, and metabolic tissue and cellular alterations accompanying carcinogenesis. This study aimed to identify novel biochemical and metabolic autofluorescence biomarkers of oral dysplasia and cancer that could be clinically imaged using novel multispectral autofluorescence lifetime imaging (maFLIM) endoscopy technologies. In vivo maFLIM clinical endoscopic images of benign, precancerous, and cancerous lesions from 67 patients were acquired using a novel maFLIM endoscope. Widefield maFLIM feature maps were generated, and statistical analyses were applied to identify maFLIM features providing contrast between dysplastic/cancerous vs. benign oral lesions. A total of 14 spectral and time-resolved maFLIM features were found to provide contrast between dysplastic/cancerous vs. benign oral lesions, representing novel biochemical and metabolic autofluorescence biomarkers of oral epithelial dysplasia and cancer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of clinical widefield maFLIM endoscopic imaging of novel biochemical and metabolic autofluorescence biomarkers of oral dysplasia and cancer, supporting the potential of maFLIM endoscopy for early detection of oral cancer.

J;Quantitative characterization of turbidity by radiative transfer based reflectance imaging;A new and noncontact approach of multispectral reflectance imaging has been developed to inversely determine the absorption coefficient of mu(a), the scattering coefficient of mu(s) and the anisotropy factor g of a turbid target from one measured reflectance image. The incident beam was profiled with a diffuse reflectance standard for deriving both measured and calculated reflectance images. A GPU implemented Monte Carlo code was developed to determine the parameters with a conjugate gradient descent algorithm and the existence of unique solutions was shown. We noninvasively determined embedded region thickness in heterogeneous targets and estimated in vivo optical parameters of nevi from 4 patients between 500 and 950nm for melanoma diagnosis to demonstrate the potentials of quantitative reflectance imaging.

J;Activatable Nanocomposite Probe for Preoperative Location and Intraoperative Navigation for Orthotopic Hepatic Tumor Resection via MSOT and Aggregation-Induced Near-IR-I/II Fluorescence Imaging;"The precise location of tumor and completeness of surgical resection are critical to successful tumor surgery; thus, the method capable of preoperatively locating a tumor site and intraoperatively determining tumor margins would be highly ideal. Herein, an activatable nanocomposite probe was developed for preoperatively locating orthotopic hepatic tumor via multispectral optoacoustic tomography imaging and for intraoperative navigation via near-IR-1 (NIR-I) and NIR-II fluorescence imaging. The molecular probe comprises an electronic donor, an acceptor, and a recognition moiety and forms the nanocomposite probe with bovine serum albumin. The probe specifically responds to nitroreductase overexpressed in tumor cells, which transforms the aromatic nitro group into an electron-donating amino group and thus activates the probe. The activated probe with the aggregation-induced emission feature generates strong NIR-I/NIR-H fluorescence and optoacoustic signals for dual-mode imaging. Owing to the in situ response toward nitroreductase in tumor cells in the hepatic region, the probe is found capable of detecting early stage orthotopic liver tumors. Furthermore, with the nanocomposite probe, we can obtain the 3D MSOT images to accurately locate orthotopic liver tumors preoperatively and the NIR-I/NIR-II fluorescence images to provide intraoperative guidance for tumor resection surgery.";2020;10.1021/acs.analchem.0c01596
J;Short-term oral administration of non-porous and mesoporous silica did not induce local or systemic toxicity in mice;"In this study, two sets of methyl-coated non-porous and mesoporous amorphous silica materials of two target sizes (100 and 300 nm; 10-844 m(2)/g) were used to investigate the potential role of specific surface area (SSA) and porosity on the oral toxicity in mice. Female Swiss mice were administered by oral gavage for 5 consecutive days. Two silica dose levels (100 and 1000 mg/kg b.w.) were tested for all four materials. All dispersions were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Batch dispersions of porous silica were rather unstable due to agglomeration. Animals were sacrificed one day after the last administration or after a three-week recovery period. No relevant toxicological effects were induced by any of the silica materials tested, as evaluated by body weight, gross pathology, relative organ weights (liver, spleen, kidneys), hematology, blood biochemistry, genotoxicity (Comet assay in jejunum cells and micronucleus test in peripheral blood erythrocytes), liver and small intestine histopathology, and intestinal inflammation. The presence of silica particles in the intestine was evaluated by a hyperspectral imaging microscopy system (CytoViva) using histological samples of jejunum tissue. Silica spectral signatures were found in jejunum samples with all the treatments, but only statistically significant in one of the treatment groups.";2020;10.1080/17435390.2020.1818325
J;In vivo measurements of diffuse reflectance and time-resolved autofluorescence emission spectra of basal cell carcinomas;We present a clinical investigation of diffuse reflectance and time-resolved autofluorescence spectra of skin cancer with an emphasis on basal cell carcinoma. A total of 25 patients were measured using a compact steady-state diffuse reflectance/fluorescence spectrometer and a fibre-optic-coupled multispectral time-resolved spectrofluorometer. Measurements were performed in vivo prior to surgical excision of the investigated region. Singular value decomposition was used to reduce the dimensionality of steady state diffuse reflectance and fluorescence spectra. Linear discriminant analysis was then applied to the measurements of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and used to predict the tissue disease state with a leave-one-out methodology. This approach was able to correctly diagnose 87% of the BCCs. With 445 nm excitation a decrease in the spectrally averaged fluorescence lifetime was observed between normal tissue and BCC lesions with a mean value of 886 ps. Furthermore, the fluorescence lifetime for BCCs was lower than that of the surrounding healthy tissue in all cases and statistical analysis of the data revealed that this decrease was significant (p = 0.002).

J;Quantitative Spatiotemporal Chemical Profiling of Individual Lipid Droplets by Hyperspectral CARS Microscopy in Living Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells;There is increasing evidence showing that cytosolic lipid droplets, present in all eukaryotic cells) play a key role in many cellular functions. Yet their composition at the individual droplet level and how it evolves over time in living cells is essentially unknown due to the lack of suitable quantitative nondestructive measurement techniques. In this work, we demonstrate the ability of label-free hyperspectral coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy, together with a quantitative image analysis algorithm developed by us, to quantify the lipid type and content in vol/vol concentration units of individual lipid droplets in living human adipose-derived stem cells during differentiation over 9 days in media supplemented with different fatty acids. Specifically, we investigated the, addition of the polyunsaturated linoleic and alpha-linolenic fatty acids into the normal differentiation medium (mostly containing monounsaturated fatty acids). We observe a heterogeneous uptake which is droplet size dependent, time dependent, and lipid dependent. Cells grown in linoleic-acid-supplemented medium show the largest distribution of lipid content across different droplets at all times during differentiation. When analyzing the average lipid content, we find that adding linoleic or alpha-linolenic fatty acids at day 0 results in uptake of the new lipid components with an exponential time constant of 22 +/- 2 h. Conversely, switching lipids at day 3 results in an exponential time constant of 60 +/- 5 h. These are unprecedented findings, exemplifying that the quantitative imaging method demonstrated here could open a radically new way of studying, and understanding cytosolic lipid droplets in living cells.;2016;10.1021/acs.analchem.5b04468
J;Engineered metal oxide nanomaterials inhibit corneal epithelial wound healing in vitro and in vivo;Ocular exposure to metal oxide engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) is common as exemplified by zinc(II) oxide (ZnO), a major constituent of sunscreens and cosmetics. The ocular surface that includes the transparent cornea and its protective tear film are common sites of exposure for metal ENMs. Despite the frequency of exposure of the ocular surface, there is a knowledge gap regarding the effects of metal oxide ENMs on the cornea in health and disease. Therefore, we studied the effects of metal oxide ENMs on the cornea in the presence or absence of injury. Cell viability of immortalized human corneal epithelial (hTCEpi) cells was assessed following treatment with 11 metal oxide ENMs with a concentration ranging from 0.5 to 250 mu g/ml for 24 h. An epithelial wound healing assay with a monolayer of hTCEpi cells was then performed using 11 metal oxide ENMs at select concentrations based on data from the viability assays. Subsequently, based on the in vitro results, in vivo testing of precorneal tear film (PTF) quantity and stability as well as a corneal epithelial wound healing were tested in the presence or absence ZnO or vanadium(V) oxide (V2O5) at a concentration of 50 mu g/ml. We found that WO3, ZnO, V2O5 and CuO ENMs significantly reduced hTCEpi cell viability in comparison to vehicle control or the other metal oxide ENMs tested. Furthermore, ZnO and V2O5 ENMs also significantly decreased hTCEpi cell migration. Although ZnO and V2O5 did not alter PTF parameters of rabbits in vivo, corneal epithelial wound healing was significantly delayed by topical ZnO while V2O5 did not alter wound healing. Finally, hyperspectral images confirmed penetration of ZnO and V2O5 through all corneal layers and into the iris stroma. Considering the marked epithelial toxicity and corneal penetration of ZnO, further investigations on the impact of this ENM on the eye are warranted.;2020;10.1016/j.impact.2019.100198
J;NG2 expression regulates vascular morphology and function in human brain tumours;"Tumour angiogenesis is a tightly regulated process involving cross-talk between tumour cells and the host tissue. The underlying mechanisms that regulate such interactions remain largely unknown. NG2 is a transmembrane proteoglyean whose presence on transformed cells has been demonstrated to increase proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. To study the effects of NG2 during tumour growth and progression, we engineered an NG2 positive human glioma cell line (U251-NG2) from parental NG2 negative cells (U251-WT) and implanted both cell types stereotactically into immunodeficient nude rat brains. The tumours were longitudinally monitored in vivo using multispectral MRI employing two differently sized contrast agents (Gd-DTPA-BMA and Gadomer) to assess vascular leakiness, vasogenic oedema, tumour volumes and necrosis. Comparisons of Gd-DTPA-BMA and Gadomer revealed differences in their spatial distribution in the U251-NG2 and U251-WT tumours. The U251-NG2 tumours exhibited a higher leakiness of the larger molecular weight Gadomer and displayed a stronger vasogenic oedema (69.9 +/- 15.2, P = 0.018), compared to the controls (10.7 +/- 7.7). Moreover, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy revealed that the U251-NG2 tumours had a higher microvascular density (11.81 +/- 0.54; P = 0.0010) compared to controls (5.76 +/- 0.87), with vessels that displayed larger gaps between the endothelial cells. Thus, tumour cells can regulate both the function and structure of the host-derived tumour vasculature through NG2 expression, suggesting a role for NG2 in the cross-talk between tumour-host compartments.

J;An advanced MRI and MRSI data fusion scheme for enhancing unsupervised brain tumor differentiation;Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (H-1 MRSI) has shown great potential in tumor diagnosis since it provides localized biochemical information discriminating different tissue types, though it typically has low spatial resolution. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MM) is widely used in tumor diagnosis as an in vivo tool due to its high resolution and excellent soft tissue discrimination. This paper presents an advanced data fusion scheme for brain tumor diagnosis using both MRSI and MM data to improve the tumor differentiation accuracy of MRSI alone. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) of the spectral feature vectors from MRSI data and the image fusion with MRI based on wavelet analysis are implemented jointly. Hence, it takes advantage of the biochemical tissue discrimination of MRSI as well as the high resolution of MM. The feasibility of the proposed frame work is validated by comparing with the expert delineations, giving mean correlation coefficients for the tumor source of 0.97 and the Dice score of tumor region overlap of 0.90. These results compare favorably against those obtained with a previously proposed NMF method where MRSI and MM are integrated by stacking the MRSI and MM features.;2017;10.1016/j.compbiomed.2016.12.017
J;Wavelength band optimization in spectral near-infrared optical tomography improves accuracy while reducing data acquisition and computational burden;Multispectral near-infrared (NIR) tomographic imaging has the potential to provide information about molecules absorbing light in tissue, as well as subcellular structures scattering light, based on transmission measurements. However, the choice of possible wavelengths used is crucial for the accurate separation of these parameters, as well as for diminishing crosstalk between the contributing chromophores. While multispectral systems are often restricted by the wavelengths of laser diodes available, continuous-wave broadband systems exist that have the advantage of providing broadband NIR spectroscopy data, albeit without the benefit of the temporal data. In this work, the use of large spectral NIR datasets is analyzed, and an objective function to find optimal spectral ranges (windows) is examined. The optimally identified wavelength bands derived from this method are tested using both simulations and experimental data. It is found that the proposed method achieves images as qualitatively accurate as using the full spectrum, but improves crosstalk between parameters. Additionally, the judicious use of these spectral windows reduces the amount of data needed for full spectral tomographic imaging by 50%, therefore increasing computation time dramatically.

J;Cutting-Edge Platforms for Analysis of Immune Cells in the Hepatic Microenvironment-Focus on Tumor-Associated Macrophages in Hepatocellular Carcinoma;Simple Summary Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common primary liver malignancy in the United States. Macrophages are immune cells that play a critical role in the promotion of cancer growth and configuration of the hepatic microenvironment. Studying intrahepatic macrophages is challenging because they are difficult to isolate, they transform their phenotype upon manipulation, and in vivo animal models poorly replicate the liver microenvironment. Understanding the complexity of intrahepatic macrophage populations is crucial because they coordinate antitumoral immunity. Application of novel methods that can detect immune cell phenotypes, along with their spatial co-localization in situ is critical and timely. The role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is poorly understood. Most studies rely on platforms that remove intrahepatic macrophages from the microenvironment prior to evaluation. Cell isolation causes activation and phenotypic changes that may not represent their actual biology and function in situ. State-of-the-art methods provides new strategies to study TAMs without losing the context of tissue architecture and spatial relationship with neighboring cells. These technologies, such as multispectral imaging (e.g., Vectra Polaris), mass cytometry by time-of-flight (e.g., Fluidigm CyTOF), cycling of fluorochromes (e.g., Akoya Biosciences CODEX/PhenoCycler-Fusion, Bruker Canopy, Lunaphore Comet, and CyCIF) and digital spatial profiling or transcriptomics (e.g., GeoMx or Visium, Vizgen Merscope) are being utilized to accurately assess the complex cellular network within the tissue microenvironment. In cancer research, these platforms enable characterization of immune cell phenotypes and expression of potential therapeutic targets, such as PDL-1 and CTLA-4. Newer spatial profiling platforms allow for detection of numerous protein targets, in combination with whole transcriptome analysis, in a single liver biopsy tissue section. Macrophages can also be specifically targeted and analyzed, enabling quantification of both protein and gene expression within specific cell phenotypes, including TAMs. This review describes the workflow of each platform, summarizes recent research using these approaches, and explains the advantages and limitations of each.;2022;10.3390/cancers14081861
J;Expanding Multimodal Microscopy by High Spectral Resolution Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering Imaging for Clinical Disease Diagnostics;Over the past years fast label-free nonlinear imaging modalities providing molecular contrast of endogenous disease markers with subcellular spatial resolution have been emerged. However, applications of these imaging modalities in clinical settings are still at the very beginning. This is because single nonlinear imaging modalities such as second-harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) have only limited value for diagnosing diseases due to the small number of endogenous markers. Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy on the other hand can potentially be added to SHG and TPEF to visualize a much broader range of marker molecules. However, CARS requires a second synchronized laser source and the detection of a certain wavenumber range of the vibrational spectrum to differentiate multiple molecules, which results in increased experimental complexity and often inefficient excitation of SHG and TPEF signals. Here we report the application of a novel near-infrared (NIR) fiber laser of 1 MHz repetition rate, 65 ps pulse duration, and 1 cm(-1) spectral resolution to realize an efficient but experimentally simple SGH/TPEF/multiplex CARS multimodal imaging approach for a label-free characterization of composition of complex tissue samples. This is demonstrated for arterial tissue specimens demonstrating differentiation of elastic fibers, triglycerides, collagen, myelin, cellular cytoplasm, and lipid droplets by analyzing the CARS spectra within the C-H stretching region only. A novel image analysis approach for multispectral CARS data based on colocalization allows correlating spectrally distinct pixels to morphologic structures. Transfer of this highly precise but compact and simple to use imaging approach into clinical settings is expected in the near future.;2013;10.1021/ac400570w
J;Gold nanoparticles in cardiovascular imaging;Although originally applied in the field of oncology, recent results have illustrated the considerable potential of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) in the imaging of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). CVDs represent the leading cause of mortality and disability in the world. The principal cause underpinning CVDs is atherosclerosis, which develops into mid and large blood vessels, often leading to severe complications. Thanks to their unique physicochemical properties, GNPs have drawn much attention from the research community in cardiovascular imaging. Thus, the optical properties of GNPs have led to their utilization as contrast agents for optical or X-ray imaging modalities allowing the detection of atherosclerotic plaques, intravascular thrombus, or fibrotic tissue. In this study, we detail the most promising preclinical scientific progresses based on the use of GNPs for imaging in cardiovascular field and their improvements for a potential clinical application.

J;Small-Animal Whole-Body Photoacoustic Tomography: A Review;With the wide use of small animals for biomedical studies, in vivo small-animal whole-body imaging plays an increasingly important role. Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is an emerging whole-body imaging modality that shows great potential for preclinical research. As a hybrid technique, PAT is based on the acoustic detection of optical absorption from either endogenous tissue chromophores, such as oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin, or exogenous contrast agents. Because ultrasound scatters much less than light in tissue, PAT generates high-resolution images in both the optical ballistic and diffusive regimes. Using near-infrared light, which has relatively low blood absorption, PAT can image through the whole body of small animals with acoustically defined spatial resolution. Anatomical and vascular structures are imaged with endogenous hemoglobin contrast, while functional and molecular images are enabled by the wide choice of exogenous optical contrasts. This paper reviews the rapidly growing field of small-animal whole-body PAT and highlights studies done in the past decade.;2014;10.1109/TBME.2013.2283507
J;Blind source unmixing in multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography;Multispectral optoacoustic (photoacoustic) tomography (MSOT) is a hybrid modality that can image through several millimeters to centimeters of diffuse tissues, attaining resolutions typical of ultrasound imaging. The method can further identify tissue biomarkers by decomposing the spectral contributions of different photo-absorbing molecules of interest. In this work we investigate the performance of blind source unmixing methods and spectral fitting approaches in decomposing the contributions of fluorescent dyes from the tissue background, based on MSOT measurements in mice. We find blind unmixing as a promising method for accurate MSOT decomposition, suitable also for spectral unmixing in fluorescence imaging. We further demonstrate its capacity with temporal unmixing on real-time MSOT data obtained in-vivo for enhancing the visualization of absorber agent flow in the mouse vascular system.

J;MULTISPECTRAL ANALYSIS FOR QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENTS OF MYOGLOBIN OXYGEN FRACTIONAL SATURATION IN THE PRESENCE OF HEMOGLOBIN INTERFERENCE;Quantitative values for myoglobin oxygen fractional saturation were extracted from visible absorption spectra of myoglobin and hemoglobin solutions by analysis with three algorithms: classical least-squares, partial least-squares, and stagewise multiple linear regression. In an effort to mimic in vivo conditions, oxygen tensions and concentrations of myoglobin and hemoglobin solutions in separate cuvettes were varied independently. Transmission measurements were made through both cuvettes so that spectra contained contributions from both myoglobin and hemoglobin. Oxygen tensions in the myoglobin solutions spanned the rapidly varying region of the myoglobin oxygen saturation curve with pO2 ranging from 0 to 4.79 Torr, corresponding to fractional saturation values between 0 and 0.903. A range of hemoglobin oxygenations from fully oxygenated to fully deoxygenated was used. Estimation of myoglobin fractional saturation by the classical least-squares algorithm had a standard error (SE(est)) of 0.094, while the partial least-squares method resulted in an SE(est) of 0.070. Partial least-squares estimations resulted in an SE(est) of 0.041 when a limited wavelength range was used. The stagewise multiple linear regression method had an SE(est) of 0.052. Results indicate that stagewise regression and partial least-squares yielded estimates of myoglobin fractional saturation that were more accurate than those obtained from classical least-squares.;1992;10.1366/0003702924123412
J;Clinically compatible flexible wide-field multi-color fluorescence endoscopy with a porcine colon model;Early detection of structural or molecular changes in dysplastic epithelial tissues is crucial for cancer screening and surveillance. Multi-targeting molecular endoscopic fluorescence imaging may improve noninvasive detection of precancerous lesions in the colon. Here, we report the first clinically compatible, wide-field-of-view, multi-color fluorescence endoscopy with a leached fiber bundle scope using a porcine model. A porcine colon model that resembles the human colon is used for the detection of surrogate tumors composed of multiple biocompatible fluorophores (FITC, ICG, and heavy metal-free quantum dots (hfQDs)). With an ex vivo porcine colon tumor model, molecular imaging with hfQDs conjugated with MMP14 antibody was achieved by spraying molecular probes on a mucosa layer that contains xenograft tumors. With an in vivo porcine colon embedded with surrogate tumors, target-to-background ratios of 3.36 +/- 0.43, 2.70 +/- 0.72, and 2.10 +/- 0.13 were achieved for FITC, ICG, and hfQD probes, respectively. This promising endoscopic technology with molecular contrast shows the capacity to reveal hidden tumors and guide treatment strategy decisions.

J;Tattoo tomography: Freehand 3D photoacoustic image reconstruction with an optical pattern;Purpose Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is a novel imaging technique that can spatially resolve both morphological and functional tissue properties, such as vessel topology and tissue oxygenation. While this capacity makes PAT a promising modality for the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of various diseases, a current drawback is the limited field of view provided by the conventionally applied 2D probes. Methods In this paper, we present a novel approach to 3D reconstruction of PAT data (Tattoo tomography) that does not require an external tracking system and can smoothly be integrated into clinical workflows. It is based on an optical pattern placed on the region of interest prior to image acquisition. This pattern is designed in a way that a single tomographic image of it enables the recovery of the probe pose relative to the coordinate system of the pattern, which serves as a global coordinate system for image compounding. Results To investigate the feasibility of Tattoo tomography, we assessed the quality of 3D image reconstruction with experimental phantom data and in vivo forearm data. The results obtained with our prototype indicate that the Tattoo method enables the accurate and precise 3D reconstruction of PAT data and may be better suited for this task than the baseline method using optical tracking. Conclusions In contrast to previous approaches to 3D ultrasound (US) or PAT reconstruction, the Tattoo approach neither requires complex external hardware nor training data acquired for a specific application. It could thus become a valuable tool for clinical freehand PAT.;2021;10.1007/s11548-021-02399-w
J;Aberrant axial mineralization precedes spinal ankylosis: a molecular imaging study in ank/ank mice;Introduction: The diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis is made from a combination of clinical features and the presence of radiographic evidence that may be detected only after many years of inflammatory back pain. It is not uncommon to have a diagnosis confirmed 5 to 10 years after the initial onset of symptoms. Development of a more-sensitive molecular imaging technology to detect structural changes in the joints would lead to earlier diagnosis and quantitative tracking of ankylosis progression. Progressive ankylosis (ank/ank) mice have a loss of function in the Ank gene, which codes for a regulator of PPi transport. In this study, we used these ank/ank mutant mice to assess a noninvasive, quantitative measure of joint ankylosis with near-infrared (NIR) molecular imaging in vivo. Methods: Three age groups (8, 12, and 18 weeks) of ank/ank (15 mice) and wild-type littermates (12 +/+ mice) were assessed histologically and radiographically. Before imaging, OsteoSense 750 (bisphosphonate pamidronate) was injected i.v. Whole-body images were analyzed by using the multispectral Maestro imaging system. Results: OsteoSense 750 signals in the paw joints were higher in ank/ank mice in all three age groups compared with controls. In the spine, significantly higher OsteoSense 750 signals were detected early, in 8-week-old ank/ank mice compared with controls, although minimal radiographic differences were noted at this time point. The molecular imaging changes in the ank/ank spine (8 weeks) were supported by histologic changes, including calcium apatite crystals at the edge of the vertebral bodies and new syndesmophyte formation. Conclusions: Changes in joint pathology of ank/ank mice, as evaluated by histologic and radiographic means, are qualitative, but only semiquantitative. In contrast, molecular imaging provides a quantitative assessment. Ankylosis in ank/ank mice developed simultaneously in distal and axial joints, contrary to the previous notion that it is a centripetal process. NIR imaging might be feasible for early disease diagnosis and for monitoring disease progression in ankylosing spondylitis.;2011;10.1186/ar3482
J;Transcutaneous monitoring of hemoglobin derivatives during methemoglobinemia in rats using spectral diffuse reflectance;Significance: Untreated methemoglobinemia may cause severe hypoxemia and even death when methemoglobin levels in the blood stream exceed 70%. Although CO-oximetry can be used to monitor the response to treatment for methemoglobinemia, it is costly and requires an invasive procedure for collecting blood samples from patients. A pulse CO-oximeter with a contact probe can be used to continuously and non-invasively measure the percentage of methemoglobin, as well as the percutaneous oxygen saturation. In terms of the prevention of infectious diseases, however, it is desirable to monitor methemoglobin and oxygen saturation levels in a non-contact manner. Diffuse reflectance spectral imaging is promising as a non-contact, non-invasive, and cost-effective clinical diagnostic tool for methemoglobinemia. Aim: To demonstrate the feasibility of visible spectral diffuse reflectance for in vivo monitoring of hemoglobin derivatives and evaluating methemoglobin production and reduction as well as hypoxemia during methemoglobinemia in rats. Approach: A new imaging approach based on the multiple regression analysis aided by Monte Carlo simulations for light transport was developed to quantify methemoglobin, oxygenated hemoglobin, and deoxygenated hemoglobin using a hyperspectral imaging system. An in vivo experiment with rats exposed to sodium nitrite (NaNO2) at different doses was performed to confirm the feasibility of the method for evaluating the dynamics of methemoglobin, oxygenated hemoglobin, and deoxygenated hemoglobin during methemoglobinemia. Systemic physiological parameters, including the percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation, heart rate (HR), and pulse distention, were measured by a commercially available pulse oximeter, and the results were compared to those obtained by the proposed method. Results: Both the methemoglobin concentration and methemoglobin saturation rapidly increased with a half-maximum time of <20 min. They reached their maximal values nearly 60 min after the administration of NaNO2. Tissue oxygen saturation dramatically dropped to a minimum of 33.7% +/- 0.4%, 23.1% +/- 5.6%, 8.8% +/- 1.7%, and 9.7% +/- 5.1% on average for NaNO2 doses of 25, 37.5, 50, and 75 mg/kg, respectively. Changes in methemoglobin concentration and tissue oxygen saturation are indicative of the temporary production of methemoglobin and severe hypoxemia during methemoglobinemia. Profound increases in the HR and pulse distention implied an elevated cardiac output caused by tachycardia and the resultant increase in peripheral blood volume to compensate for the hypoxia and hypoxemia during methemoglobinemia. This was in agreement with the time course of the peripheral hemoglobin volume concentration obtained by the proposed method. Conclusions: The proposed method is capable of the in vivo non-contact simultaneous evaluation of methemoglobin levels and hypoxemia during methemoglobinemia, and that it has potential as a tool for the diagnosis and management of methemoglobinemia.

J;Dynamic spatio-temporal control of naturally sourced soft photonic crystals;The quest for flexible curvilinear displays is driving renewed interest in natural soft photonic systems that rely on the adaptable response of nanostructured living tissues to external stimuli for camouflage and energy management. Understanding and controlling the dynamics of these systems is challenging due to difficulties in sourcing the tissues and constraints in the ability to stimulate them. Here, we present an ex-vivo approach to systematically investigate soft biophotonic crystals and dynamically control their response by using the Bos taurus tapetum as a model system. The tapetum's structural color is controlled chemically and electronically and examined by multispectral imaging providing insights on the color change dynamics. The ability to spatio-temporally control the optical response of biophotonic crystals provides insights for the development of soft photonic systems for displays and dynamic light management. Controlling the dynamics of natural soft photonic systems is challenging due to difficulties in sourcing and stimulating them. Here, natural bovine tapetum is used to investigate soft biophotonic crystals and dynamically control their response, providing insight into the development of displays and dynamic light management.;2022;10.1038/s43246-022-00305-8
J;Hypoxia inducible microRNA 210 attenuates keratinocyte proliferation and impairs closure in a murine model of ischemic wounds;Ischemia complicates wound closure. Here, we are unique in presenting a murine ischemic wound model that is based on bipedicle flap approach. Using this model of ischemic wounds we have sought to elucidate how microRNAs may be implicated in limiting wound re-epithelialization under hypoxia, a major component of ischemia. Ischemia, evaluated by laser Doppler as well as hyperspectral imaging, limited blood flow and lowered tissue oxygen saturation. EPR oximetry demonstrated that the ischemic wound tissue had pO(2) < 10 mm Hg. Ischemic wounds suffered from compromised macrophage recruitment and delayed wound epithelialization. Specifically, epithelial proliferation, as determined by Ki67 staining, was compromised. In vivo imaging showed massive hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) stabilization in ischemic wounds, where HIF-1 alpha induced miR-210 expression that, in turn, silenced its target E2F3, which was markedly down-regulated in the wound-edge tissue of ischemic wounds. E2F3 was recognized as a key facilitator of cell proliferation. In keratinocytes, knock-down of E2F3 limited cell proliferation. Forced stabilization of HIF-1 alpha using Ad-VP16-HIF-1 alpha under normoxic conditions upregulated miR-210 expression, down-regulated E2F3, and limited cell proliferation. Studies using cellular delivery of miR-210 antagomir and mimic demonstrated a key role of miR-210 in limiting keratinocyte proliferation. In summary, these results are unique in presenting evidence demonstrating that the hypoxia component of ischemia may limit wound re-epithelialization by stabilizing HIF-1 alpha, which induces miR-210 expression, resulting in the down-regulation of the cell-cycle regulatory protein E2F3.;2010;10.1073/pnas.1001653107
J;Diagnostic prospects and preclinical development of optical technologies using gold nanostructure contrast agents to boost endogenous tissue contrast;"Numerous developments in optical biomedical imaging research utilizing gold nanostructures as contrast agents have advanced beyond basic research towards demonstrating potential as diagnostic tools; some of which are translating into clinical applications. Recent advances in optics, lasers and detection instrumentation along with the extensive, yet developing, knowledge-base in tailoring the optical properties of gold nanostructures has significantly improved the prospect of near-infrared (NIR) optical detection technologies. Of particular interest are optical coherence tomography (OCT), photoacoustic imaging (PAI), multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), Raman spectroscopy (RS) and surface enhanced spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SESORS), due to their respective advancements. Here we discuss recent technological developments, as well as provide a prediction of their potential to impact on clinical diagnostics. A brief summary of each techniques' capability to distinguish abnormal (disease sites) from normal tissues, using endogenous signals alone is presented. We then elaborate on the use of exogenous gold nanostructures as contrast agents providing enhanced performance in the above-mentioned techniques. Finally, we consider the potential of these approaches to further catalyse advances in pre-clinical and clinical optical diagnostic technologies.";2020;10.1039/d0sc01926g
J;In vivo measurement of skin microrelief using photometric stereo in the presence of interreflections;This paper proposes and describes an implementation of a photometric stereo-based technique for in vivo assessment of three-dimensional (3D) skin topography in the presence of interreflections. The proposed method illuminates skin with red, green, and blue colored lights and uses the resulting variation in surface gradients to mitigate the effects of interreflections. Experiments were carried out on Caucasian, Asian, and African American subjects to demonstrate the accuracy of our method and to validate the measurements produced by our system. Our method produced significant improvement in 3D surface reconstruction for all Caucasian, Asian, and African American skin types. The results also illustrate the differences in recovered skin topography due to the nondiffuse bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) for each color illumination used, which also concur with the existing multispectral BRDF data available for skin.

C;Coherent Raman dual-comb spectroscopy and imaging;The invention of the optical frequency comb technique has revolutionized the field of precision spectroscopy, providing a way to measure the absolute frequency of any optical transition. Since, frequency combs have become common equipment for frequency metrology. In the last decade, novel applications for the optical frequency comb have been demonstrated beyond its original purpose. Broadband molecular spectroscopy is one of those. One such technique of molecular spectroscopy with frequency combs, dual-comb Fourier transform spectroscopy provides short measurement times with resolution and accuracy. Two laser frequency combs with slightly different repetition frequencies generate pairs of pulses with a linearly-scanned delay between pulses in a pair. The system without moving parts mimics a fast scanning Fourier transform interferometer. The measurement speed may be several orders of magnitude faster than that of a Michelson-based Fourier transform spectrometer, which opens up new opportunities for broadband molecular spectroscopy. Recently, dual-comb spectroscopy has been extended to nonlinear phenomena. A broadband Raman spectrum of molecular fingerprints may be measured within a few tens of microseconds with coherent Raman dual-comb spectroscopy. Raster scanning the sample leads to hyperspectral images. This rapid and broadband label-free vibrational spectroscopy and imaging technique might provide new diagnostic methods in a variety of scientific and industrial fields.;2014;10.1117/12.2071156
J;Leaf microscopy applications in photosynthesis research: identifying the gaps;Leaf imaging via microscopy has provided critical insights into research on photosynthesis at multiple junctures, from the early understanding of the role of stomata, through elucidating C-4 photosynthesis via Kranz anatomy and chloroplast arrangement in single cells, to detailed explorations of diffusion pathways and light utilization gradients within leaves. In recent decades, the original two-dimensional (2D) explorations have begun to be visualized in three-dimensional (3D) space, revising our understanding of structure-function relationships between internal leaf anatomy and photosynthesis. In particular, advancing new technologies and analyses are providing fresh insight into the relationship between leaf cellular components and improving the ability to model net carbon fixation, water use efficiency, and metabolite turnover rate in leaves. While ground-breaking developments in imaging tools and techniques have expanded our knowledge of leaf 3D structure via high-resolution 3D and time-series images, there is a growing need for more in vivo imaging as well as metabolite imaging. However, these advances necessitate further improvement in microscopy sciences to overcome the unique challenges a green leaf poses. In this review, we discuss the available tools, techniques, challenges, and gaps for efficient in vivo leaf 3D imaging, as well as innovations to overcome these difficulties. We review the techniques applied in leaf imaging to model anatomy and locate metabolites, and evaluate their power and efficiency in addressing fundamental questions in photosynthetic research.;2022;10.1093/jxb/erab548
J;Quantum dots light up pathology;Quantum dots (QDs) are novel nanocrystal fluorophores with extremely high fluorescence efficiency and minimal photobleaching. They also possess a constant excitation wavelength together with sharp and symmetrical tunable emission spectra. These unique optical properties make them near-perfect fluorescent markers and there has recently been rapid development of their use for bioimaging. QDs can be conjugated to a wide range of biological targets, including proteins, antibodies, and nucleic acid probes, rendering them of particular interest to pathology researchers. They have been used in multiplex immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, which when combined with multispectral imaging, has enabled quantitative measurement of gene expression in situ. QDs have also been used for live in vivo animal imaging and are now being applied to an ever-increasing range of biological problems. These are detailed in this review, which also acts to outline the important advances that have been made in their range of applications. The relative novelty of QDs can present problems in their practical use and guidelines for their application are given. Copyright (C) 2008 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

J;Clinically translatable quantitative molecular photoacoustic imaging with liposome-encapsulated ICG J-aggregates;Photoacoustic imaging is limited by a lack of contrast agents which can enable combined molecular and physiological imaging at depth. Here the authors address these limitations by developing and validating a contrast agent based on targeted liposomes loaded with J-aggregated indocyanine green dye. Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is a functional and molecular imaging technique capable of high sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution at depth. Widespread use of PA imaging, however, is limited by currently available contrast agents, which either lack PA-signal-generation ability for deep imaging or their absorbance spectra overlap with hemoglobin, reducing sensitivity. Here we report on a PA contrast agent based on targeted liposomes loaded with J-aggregated indocyanine green (ICG) dye (i.e., PAtrace) that we synthesized, bioconjugated, and characterized to addresses these limitations. We then validated PAtrace in phantom, in vitro, and in vivo PA imaging environments for both spectral unmixing accuracy and targeting efficacy in a folate receptor alpha-positive ovarian cancer model. These study results show that PAtrace concurrently provides significantly improved contrast-agent quantification/sensitivity and SO2 estimation accuracy compared to monomeric ICG. PAtrace's performance attributes and composition of FDA-approved components make it a promising agent for future clinical molecular PA imaging.;2021;10.1038/s41467-021-25452-3
J;Characterizing the origin of autofluorescence in human esophageal epithelium under ultraviolet excitation;The autofluorescence under ultraviolet excitation arising from normal squamous and columnar esophageal mucosa is investigated using multispectral microscopy. The results suggest that the autofluorescence signal arises from the superficial tissue layer due to the short penetration depth of the ultraviolet excitation. As a result, visualization of esophageal epithelial cells and their organization can be attained using wide-field autofluorescence microscopy. Our results show tryptophan to be the dominant source of emission under 266 nm excitation, while emission from NADH and collagen are dominant under 355 nm excitation. The analysis of multispectral microscopy images reveals that tryptophan offers the highest image contrast due to its non-uniform distribution in the sub-cellular matrix. This technique can simultaneously provide functional and structural imaging of the microstructure using only the intrinsic tissue fluorophores.

J;Early diagnosis of cerebral thrombosis by EGFP-EGF1 protein conjugated ferroferric oxide magnetic nanoparticles;"Cerebral thrombosis disease is a worldwide problem, with high rates of morbidity, disability, and mortality. Magnetic resonance imaging diffusion-weighted imaging was used as an important early diagnostic method for cerebral thrombotic diseases; however, its diagnosis time is 2 h after onset. In this study, we designed EGFP-EGF1-NP-Fe3O4 for earlier diagnosis of cerebral thrombosis by taking advantage of EGFP-EGF1 fusion protein, in which EGF1 can bind with tissue factor and enhanced green fluorescent protein has previously been widely used as a fluorescent protein marker. EGFP-EGF1-NP-Fe3O4 or NP-Fe3O4 reaches the highest concentration in the infarction areas in 1 h. To evaluate the targeting ability of EGFP-EGF1-NP-Fe3O4, a fluorochrome dye, Dir, was loaded into the nanoparticle. As shown by the in vivo organ multispectral fluorescence imaging, Dir-loaded EGFP-EGF1-NP-Fe3O4 exhibited higher fluorescence than those of model rats treated with Dir-loaded NP-Fe3O4. Coronal frozen sections and transmission electron microscope further showed that EGFP-EGF1-NP-Fe3O4 was mainly accumulated in the tissue factor exposure region of brain. The data indicated that the EGFP-EGF1-NP-Fe3O4 targeted cerebral thrombosis and might be applied in the early diagnosis of intracranial thrombosis.";2019;10.1177/0885328218823475
J;Photoacoustic flow cytometry;Conventional flow cytometry using scattering and fluorescent detection methods has been a fundamental tool of biological discoveries for many years. Invasive extraction of cells from a living organism, however, may lead to changes in cell properties and prevents the long-term study of cells in their native environment. Here, we summarize recent advances of new generation flow cytometry for in vivo noninvasive label-free or targeted detection of cells in blood, lymph, bone, cerebral and plant vasculatures using photoacoustic (PA) detection techniques, multispectral high-pulse-repetition-rate lasers, tunable ultra-sharp (up to 0.8 nm) rainbow plasmonic nanoprobes, positive and negative PA contrasts, in vivo magnetic enrichment, time-of-flight cell velocity measurement, PA spectral analysis, and integration of PA, photothermal (PT), fluorescent, and Raman methods. Unique applications of this tool are reviewed with a focus on ultrasensitive detection of normal blood cells at different functional states (e.g., apoptotic and necrotic) and rare abnormal cells including circulating tumor cells (CTCs), cancer stem cells, pathogens, clots, sickle cells as well as pharmokinetics of nanoparticles, dyes, microbubbles and drug nanocarriers. Using this tool we discovered that palpation, biopsy, or surgery can enhance CTC release from primary tumors, increasing the risk of metastasis. The novel fluctuation flow cytometry provided the opportunity for the dynamic study of blood rheology including red blood cell aggregation and clot formation in different medical conditions (e.g., blood disorders, cancer, or surgery). Theranostics, as a combination of PA diagnosis and PT nanobubble-amplified multiplex therapy, was used for eradication of CTCs, purging of infected blood, and thrombolysis of clots using PA guidance to control therapy efficiency. In vivo flow cytometry using a portable fiber-based devices can provide a breakthrough platform for early diagnosis of cancer, infection and cardiovascular disorders with a potential to inhibit, if not prevent, metastasis, sepsis, and strokes or heart attack by well-timed personalized therapy.

J;Cerebral Blood Oxygenation Measurement Based on Oxygen-dependent Quenching of Phosphorescence;Monitoring of the spatiotemporal characteristics of cerebral blood and tissue oxygenation is crucial for better understanding of the neurometabolic- vascular relationship. Development of new pO2 measurement modalities with simultaneous monitoring of pO2 in larger fields of view with higher spatial and/or temporal resolution will enable greater insight into the functioning of the normal brain and will also have significant impact on diagnosis and treatment of neurovascular diseases such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and head injury. Optical imaging modalities have shown a great potential to provide high spatiotemporal resolution and quantitative imaging of pO2 based on hemoglobin absorption in visible and near infrared range of optical spectrum. However, multispectral measurement of cerebral blood oxygenation relies on photon migration through the highly scattering brain tissue. Estimation and modeling of tissue optical parameters, which may undergo dynamic changes during the experiment, is typically required for accurate estimation of blood oxygenation. On the other hand, estimation of the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) based on oxygen-dependent quenching of phosphorescence should not be significantly affected by the changes in the optical parameters of the tissue and provides an absolute measure of pO2. Experimental systems that utilize oxygen-sensitive dyes have been demonstrated in in vivo studies of the perfused tissue as well as for monitoring the oxygen content in tissue cultures, showing that phosphorescence quenching is a potent technology capable of accurate oxygen imaging in the physiological pO2 range. Here we demonstrate with two different imaging modalities how to perform measurement of pO2 in cortical vasculature based on phosphorescence lifetime imaging. In first demonstration we present wide field of view imaging of pO2 at the cortical surface of a rat. This imaging modality has relatively simple experimental setup based on a CCD camera and a pulsed green laser. An example of monitoring the cortical spreading depression based on phosphorescence lifetime of Oxyphor R3 dye was presented. In second demonstration we present a high resolution two-photon pO2 imaging in cortical micro vasculature of a mouse. The experimental setup includes a custom built 2-photon microscope with femtosecond laser, electro-optic modulator, and photon-counting photo multiplier tube. We present an example of imaging the pO2 heterogeneity in the cortical microvasculature including capillaries, using a novel PtP-C343 dye with enhanced 2-photon excitation cross section.;2011;10.3791/1694
C;Microspectroscopy of Nanomaterials, Biological Species and Live Cells;"Spectroscopic investigations of material samples on the microscopic and nano-scales, incorporating different modalities such as Raman, photoluminescence, TransmissionAbsorption-Reflection(TAR), and transient spectroscopy, are growing increasingly popular to collect quantitative and functional information of materials. Typical samples can range from in-vitro and in-vivo tissue samples, living cells, quantum structures (dots, wires), material surfaces, microfluidics and nano-crystals. Enhancing traditional microscopy systems by coupling a spectrometer to them offers the added dimension of higher density multichannel spectral information. This information can unlock deeper chemical, dynamic and conformational information on various materials. Different approaches are taken in configuring such systems from the commercially available fully integrated 'black box' tailored for specific types of application and/or spectral modalities, to the in-house purpose-built modular systems where the end-users build and integrate their own system from various individual components. There are advantages and limitations with either approach This article outlines various aspects and implications for taking the modular approach to constructing one's microspectroscopy setup. In particular, examples are illustrated where Andor Technology's dedicated, highly configurable interfaces for microspectroscopy utilize various optical and optomechanical components to facilitate flexible direct and indirect coupling of the spectrometer to the microscope. Software options are discussed for control of the system and data collection/processing to allow for multitrack and hyperspectral imaging, as well as fast chemical mapping. Sensitivity is a key technical challenge in most scenarios when dealing with such small sample volumes; an outline of where the latest CCD, EMCCD, and sCMOS technology offers benefits in sensitivity are also discussed.";2019;10.1117/12.2510598
J;3D-multi-spectral T-2 mapping near metal implants;Purpose: Due to host-mediated adverse reaction to metallic debris, there is an increasing need for noninvasive assessment of the soft tissue surrounding large joint arthroplasties. Quantitative T-2 mapping can be beneficial for tissue characterization and early diagnosis of tissue pathology but current T-2 mapping techniques lack the capability to image near metal hardware. A novel multi-spectral T-2 mapping technique is proposed to address this unmet need. Methods: A T-2 mapping pulse sequence based on routinely implemented 3D multispectral imaging (3D-MSI) pulse sequences is described and demonstrated. The 3D-MSI pulse sequence is altered to acquire images at 2 echo times. Phantom and knee experiments were performed to assess the quantitative capabilities of the sequence in comparison to a commercially available T-2 mapping sequence. The technique was demonstrated for use within a clinical protocol in 2 total hip arthroplasty (THA) cases to assess T-2 variations within the periprosthetic joint space. Results: The proposed multi-spectral T-2 mapping technique agreed, within experimental errors, with T-2 values derived from a commercially available clinical standard of care T-2 mapping sequence. The same level of agreement was observed in quantitative phantoms and in vivo experiments. In THA cases, the method was able to assess variations of T-2 within the synovial envelope immediately adjacent to implant interfaces. Conclusions: The proposed 3D-MSI T-2 mapping sequence was successfully demonstrated in assessing tissue T-2 variations near metal implants.;2019;10.1002/mrm.27744
J;Synthesis of NQO1-activatable Optoacoustic Probe and Its Imaging of Breast Cancer;NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) is a cytosolic two-electron-specific reductase whose abnormal expression is associated with breast cancer, and NQO1 has been regarded as an important biomarker for monitoring the occurrence and development of breast tumors. Although there are some research reports involving fluorescent probes for imaging NQO1 in vivo, they generally suffer from the strong light scattering by tissues which would cause the spatial resolution of fluorescent signals degrade rapidly with imaging depth. On the other hand, as an emerging detection and imaging modality, optoacoustic tomography (OAT) is capable of providing more detailed information in deep biological tissues than fluorescent imaging, since in OAT ultrasound signals are the reporting signals. To overcome the inherent defects of fluorescent imaging, in this work, we developed a novel near-infrared (NIR) NQO1-activatable optoacoustic (OA) probe TPA-X-Q based on the push-pull internal charge transfer (ICT) scaffold. TPA-X-Q consists of a NQO1-responsive moiety, quinone propionate group and a NIR chromophore TPA-X-OH. In the absence of the enzyme NQO1, the probe displays nearly no noticeable OA signal upon NIR excitation. Whereas in the presence of NQO1, the quinone propionate group of TPA-X-Q is reduced and cleaved by the enzymatic reaction triggered by NQO1, and thus TPA-X-Q is transformed into TPA-X-OH, consequently evident OA signal is generated, thereby realizing the detection and imaging of NQO1. As for the probe, the limit of detection (LOD) is determined to be 0.193 mu g.mL(-1). Furthermore, the probe TPA-X-Q displays several advantages, such as quite good selectivity towards NQO1, low cytotoxicity and excellent photostability. Moreover, the probe has been successfully utilized to detect and image the overexpressed NQO1 in the breast cancer-bearing mouse model. Orthogonal-view three-dimensional (3D) images can also be obtained by using multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), and thus precise localization of the breast cancer tumors can be achieved. This probe holds great potential for being employed as an efficacious tool for diagnosing breast cancer via responding to NQO1.;2021;10.6023/A20100459
J;Assessing in vitro stem-cell function and tracking engraftment of stem cells in ischaemic hearts by using novel iRFP gene labelling;Near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging by using infrared fluorescent protein (iRFP) gene labelling is a novel technology with potential value for in vivo applications. In this study, we expressed iRFP in mouse cardiac progenitor cells (CPC) by lentiviral vector and demonstrated that the iRFP-labelled CPC (CPCiRFP) can be detected by flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy. We observed a linear correlation in vitro between cell numbers and infrared signal intensity by using the multiSpectral imaging system. CPCiRFP injected into the non-ischaemic mouse hindlimb were also readily detected by whole-animal NIRF imaging. We then compared iRFP against green fluorescent protein (GFP) for tracking survival of engrafted CPC in mouse ischaemic heart tissue. GFP-labelled CPC (CPCGFP) or CPC labelled with both iRFP and GFP (CPCiRFP (GFP)) were injected intramyocardially into mouse hearts after infarction. Three days after cell transplantation, a strong NIRF signal was detected in hearts into which CPCiRFP (GFP), but not CPCGFP, were transplanted. Furthermore, iRFP fluorescence from engrafted CPCiRFP (GFP) was detected in tissue sections by confocal microscopy. In conclusion, the iRFP-labelling system provides a valuable molecular imaging tool to track the fate of transplanted progenitor cells in vivo.;2014;10.1111/jcmm.12321
J;Raman and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microspectroscopy for biomedical applications;A tutorial article is presented for the use of linear and nonlinear Raman microspectroscopies in biomedical diagnostics. Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) is the most frequently applied nonlinear variant of Raman spectroscopy. The basic concepts of Raman and CARS are introduced first, and subsequent biomedical applications of Raman and CARS are described. Raman microspectroscopy is applied to both in-vivo and in-vitro tissue diagnostics, and the characterization and identification of individual mammalian cells. These applications benefit from the fact that Raman spectra provide specific information on the chemical composition and molecular structure in a label-free and nondestructive manner. Combining the chemical specificity of Raman spectroscopy with the spatial resolution of an optical microscope allows recording hyperspectral images with molecular contrast. We also elaborate on interfacing Raman spectroscopic tools with other technologies such as optical tweezing, microfluidics and fiber optic probes. Thereby, we aim at presenting a guide into one exciting branch of modern biophotonics research. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

J;Long-term evolution of diffusion tensor indices after temporary experimental ischemic stroke in rats;Diffusion tensor (DT) imaging measures the random molecular diffusion of water in vivo and provides information on the microstructure of tissue. Ischemic brain damage leads to tissue disorganization and structural lost. We aimed to evaluate these changes in a rat model of focal stroke from the hyperacute to chronic phase by utilizing several DT indices. Adult male Wistar rats, subjected to temporary focal cerebral ischemia by suture occlusion of the middle cerebral artery for 90 min, and sham controls were serially imaged at 4.7 Tesla. DT scans were collected repeatedly during the hyperacute (2 and 3.5 h), acute (1, 2, and 3 days), subacute (4, 7, and 14 days), and chronic (4, 6, and 8 weeks) phases. We measured the evolution of DT indices (mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (lambda(parallel to)), radial diffusivity (lambda(perpendicular to)), and fractional anisotropy (FA)) in the cortex, subcortex, and corpus callosum of the ischemic hemisphere. In the hyperacute phase, MD, lambda(parallel to), and lambda(perpendicular to) reduced with no change in FA. From the acute to subacute phase, MD, lambda(parallel to), and lambda(perpendicular to) normalized and thereafter increased, whereas FA decreased in all the tissues. In the chronic phase, MD, lambda(parallel to), and lambda(perpendicular to) continued to rise, whereas FA normalized in the corpus callosum and subcortex, but remained low in the cortex. We described structural tissue changes in ischemic rat brain longitudinally utilizing DT analysis. DT indices reveal different individual patterns reflecting different facades and phases of tissue injury. The use of several DT indices may improve accuracy in estimating the age of the brain injury and in detecting ongoing pathological events. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J;Intratracheally instilled titanium dioxide nanoparticles translocate to heart and liver and activate complement cascade in the heart of C57BL/6 mice;"An estimated 1% or less of nanoparticles (NPs) deposited in the lungs translocate to systemic circulation and enter other organs; however, this estimation may not be accurate given the low sensitivity of existing in vivo NP detection methods. Moreover, the biological effects of such low levels of translocation are unclear. We employed a nano-scale hyperspectral microscope to spatially observe and spectrally profile NPs in tissues and blood following pulmonary deposition in mice. In addition, we characterized effects occurring in blood, liver and heart at the mRNA and protein level following translocation from the lungs. Adult female C57BL/6 mice were exposed via intratracheal instillation to 18 or 162 mu g of industrially relevant titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nano-TiO2) alongside vehicle controls. Using the nano-scale hyperspectral microscope, translocation to heart and liver was confirmed at both doses, and to blood at the highest dose, in mice analyzed 24 h post-exposure. Global gene expression profiling and ELISA analysis revealed activation of complement cascade and inflammatory processes in heart and specific activation of complement factor 3 in blood, suggesting activation of an early innate immune response essential for particle opsonisation and clearance. The liver showed a subtle response with changes in the expression of genes associated with acute phase response. This study characterizes the subtle systemic effects that occur in liver and heart tissues following pulmonary exposure and low levels of translocation of nano-TiO2 from lungs.";2015;10.3109/17435390.2014.996192
J;Optoacoustics delineates murine breast cancer models displaying angiogenesis and vascular mimicry;BACKGROUND: Optoacoustic tomography (OT) of breast tumour oxygenation is a promising new technique, currently in clinical trials, which may help to determine disease stage and therapeutic response. However, the ability of OT to distinguish breast tumours displaying different vascular characteristics has yet to be established. The aim of the study is to prove OT as a sensitive technique for differentiating breast tumour models with manifestly different vasculatures. METHODS: Multispectral OT (MSOT) was performed in oestrogen-dependent (MCF-7) and oestrogen-independent (MDA-MB-231) orthotopic breast cancer xenografts. Total haemoglobin (THb) and oxygen saturation (SO2MSOT) were calculated. Pathological and biochemical evaluation of the tumour vascular phenotype was performed for validation. RESULTS: MCF-7 tumours show SO2 MSOT similar to healthy tissue in both rim and core, despite significantly lower THb in the core. MDA-MB-231 tumours show markedly lower SO2 MSOT with a significant rim-core disparity. Ex vivo analysis revealed that MCF-7 tumours contain fewer blood vessels (CD31+) that are more mature (CD31+/aSMA+) than MDA-MB-231. MCF-7 presented higher levels of stromal VEGF and iNOS, with increased NO serum levels. The vasculogenic process observed in MCF-7 was consistent with angiogenesis, while MDA-MB-231 appeared to rely more on vascular mimicry. CONCLUSIONS: OT is sensitive to differences in the vascular phenotypes of our breast cancer models.;2018;10.1038/s41416-018-0033-x
J;Photoacoustic oximetry imaging performance evaluation using dynamic blood flow phantoms with tunable oxygen saturation;Multispectral photoacoustic oximetry imaging (MPOI) is an emerging hybrid modality that enables the spatial mapping of blood oxygen saturation (SO2) to depths of several centimeters. To facilitate MPOI device development and clinical translation, well-validated performance test methods and improved quantitative understanding of physical processes and best practices are needed. We developed a breast-mimicking blood flow phantom with tunable SO2 and used this phantom to evaluate a custom MPOI system. Results provide quantitative evaluation of the impact of phantom medium properties (Intralipid versus polyvinyl chloride plastisol) and device design parameters (different transducers) on SO2 measurement accuracy. especially depth-dependent performance degradation due to fluence artifacts. This approach may guide development of standardized test methods for evaluating MPOI devices.;2019;10.1364/BOE.10.000449
J;Quantitative photoacoustic tomography;In this paper, several algorithms that allow for quantitative photoacoustic reconstruction of tissue optical, acoustic and physiological properties are described in a finite-element method based framework. These quantitative reconstruction algorithms are compared, and the merits and limitations associated with these methods are discussed. In addition, a multispectral approach is presented for concurrent reconstructions of multiple parameters including deoxyhaemoglobin, oxyhaemoglobin and water concentrations as well as acoustic speed. Simulation and in vivo experiments are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the reconstruction algorithms presented.;2009;10.1098/rsta.2009.0083
C;Optical mechanisms for detection of lipid-rich atherosclerotic plaques by near-infrared spectroscopy - art. no. 68422A;InfraReDx has developed a spectroscopic cardiac catheter system capable of acquiring near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectra from coronary arteries in vivo for identification of lipid-rich plaques of interest (LRP). The spectral data are analyzed with a chemometric model, producing a hyperspectral image (a chemogram) used to identify LRP in the interrogated region. In this paper, we describe a FT-IR microscopy system for measurement of the NIR scattering and absorption properties of healthy and diseased regions of human coronary arteries in small volumes (similar to 10 mu l). Scattering and absorption coefficients are obtained from sequential 140 um x 140 um regions of interest across the face of 500-micron thick, saline-irrigated fresh coronary artery sections. A customized FTIR microscope, measurement protocol, and inversion algorithm are used for optical property determination, and the system is calibrated using measurements of tissue-simulating phantoms having well-characterized optical properties. Tissue optical properties are co-registered with brightfield transmission images as well as with stained histologic thin sections (H&E, Movat Pentachrome, and Oil Red O) acquired from an immediately-adjacent section. The ultimate goal of these experiments is to establish a mechanistic link between the multivariate model predictions displayed on the InfraReDx chemogram and the light-tissue interactions that govern the measured NIR reflectance spectra.;2008;10.1117/12.761723
J;Fluorescence-Tagged Gold Nanoparticles for Rapidly Characterizing the Size-Dependent Biodistribution in Tumor Models;Nanoparticle vehicles may improve the delivery of contrast agents and therapeutics to diseased tissues, but their rational design is currently impeded by a lack of robust technologies to characterize their in vivo behavior in realtime. This study demonstrates that fluorescent-labeled gold nanoparticles can be optimized for in vivo detection, perform pharmacokinetic analysis of nanoparticle designs, analyze tumor extravasation, and clearance kinetics in tumor-bearing animals. This optical imaging approach is non-invasive and high-throughput. Interestingly, these fluorescent gold nanoparticles can be used for multispectral imaging to compare several nanoparticle designs simultaneously within the same animal and eliminates the host-dependent variabilities across measured data. Together these results describe a novel platform for evaluating the performance of tumor-targeting nanoparticles, and provide new insights for the design of future nanotherapeutics.;2012;10.1002/adhm.201200084
J;Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy: overcoming technical barriers for clinical translation;Clinical translation of coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy is of great interest because of the advantages of noninvasive label-free imaging, high sensitivity, and chemical specificity. For this to happen, we have identified and review the technical barriers that must be overcome. Prior investigations have developed advanced techniques (features), each of which can be used to effectively overcome one particular technical barrier. However, the implementation of one or a small number of these advanced features in previous attempts for clinical translation has often introduced more tradeoffs than benefits. In this review, we outline a strategy that would integrate multiple advanced features to overcome all the technical barriers simultaneously, effectively reduce tradeoffs, and synergistically optimize CARS microscopy for clinical translation. The operation of the envisioned system incorporates coherent Raman micro-spectroscopy for identifying vibrational biomolecular markers of disease and single-frequency (or hyperspectral) Raman imaging of these specific biomarkers for real-time in vivo diagnostics and monitoring.

J;Non-invasive determination of murine placental and foetal functional parameters with multispectral optoacoustic tomography;Despite the importance of placental function in embryonic development, it remains poorly understood and challenging to characterize, primarily due to the lack of non-invasive imaging tools capable of monitoring placental and foetal oxygenation and perfusion parameters during pregnancy. We developed an optoacoustic tomography approach for real-time imaging through entire similar to 4 cm cross-sections of pregnant mice. Functional changes in both maternal and embryo regions were studied at different gestation days when subjected to an oxygen breathing challenge and perfusion with indocyanine green. Structural phenotyping of the cross-sectional scans highlighted different internal organs, whereas multi-wavelength acquisitions enabled non-invasive label-free spectroscopic assessment of blood-oxygenation parameters in foeto-placental regions, rendering a strong correlation with the amount of oxygen administered. Likewise, the placental function in protecting the embryo from extrinsically administered agents was substantiated. The proposed methodology may potentially further serve as a probing mechanism to appraise embryo development during pregnancy in the clinical setting.;2019;10.1038/s41377-019-0181-7
J;Photoacoustic imaging of kidney fibrosis for assessing pretransplant organ quality;Roughly 10% of the world's population has chronic kidney disease (CKD). In its advanced stages, CKD greatly increases the risk of hospitalization and death. Although kidney transplantation has revolutionized the care of advanced CKD, clinicians have limited ways of assessing donor kidney quality. Thus, optimal donor kidney-recipient matching cannot be performed, meaning that some patients receive damaged kidneys that function poorly. Fibrosis is a form of chronic damage often present in donor kidneys, and it is an important predictor of future renal function. Currently, no safe, easy-to-perform technique exists that accurately quantifies renal fibrosis. We describe a potentially novel photoacoustic (PA) imaging technique that directly images collagen, the principal component of fibrotic tissue. PA imaging noninvasively quantifies whole kidney fibrotic burden in mice, and cortical fibrosis in pig and human kidneys, with outstanding accuracy and speed. Remarkably, 3-dimensional PA imaging exhibited sufficiently high resolution to capture intrarenal variations in collagen content. We further show that PA imaging can be performed in a setting that mimics human kidney transplantation, suggesting the potential for rapid clinical translation. Taken together, our data suggest that PA collagen imaging is a major advance in fibrosis quantification that could have widespread preclinical and clinical impact.;2020;10.1172/jci.insight.136995
J;In Vivo Reflectance Confocal Microscopy of Gold Microparticles Deposited in the Skin. A Case Report on Cutaneous Chrysiasis;Cutaneous chrysiasis is gold deposition in the dermis, described after parenteral administration of gold salts or after topical exposure to gold-containing materials. Gold microparticles (GMPs) have versatile therapeutic effects and are increasingly used in medicine. This case report describes the development of a blue-gray macule following the facial application of GMPs and laser treatment of acne vulgaris. Dermoscopy showed a nonspecific homogenous blue-gray pattern, gradually fading over an 8-month-period. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) detected hyperreflective, subcellular particles in the papillary dermis, localized around hair follicles, eccrine glands, and inside macrophages. Histopathological evaluation, darkfield illumination with hyperspectral imaging, and neutron activation analysis confirmed the presence of GMPs in the dermis. RCM allowed non-invasive fast visualization of aggregates of hyperreflective particles in the dermis and can potentially be used for monitoring localized cutaneous chrysiasis and other metal deposition conditions over time.

J;Hitchhiking probiotic vectors to deliver ultra-small hafnia nanoparticles for 'Color' gastrointestinal tract photon counting X-ray imaging;Gastrointestinal (GI) tract is one of the hard-to-reach target tissues for the delivery of contrast agents and drugs mediated by nanoparticles due to its harsh environment. Herein, we overcame this barrier by designing orally ingestible probiotic vectors for 'hitchhiking' ultrasmall hafnia (HfO2) (similar to 1-2 nm) nanoparticles. The minute-made synthesis of these nanoparticles is accomplished through a simple reduction reaction. These nanoparticles were incubated with probiotic bacteria with potential health benefits and were non-specifically taken up due to their small size. Subsequently, the bacteria were lyophilized and packed into a capsule to be administered orally as the radiopaque contrast agents for delineating the GI features. These nano-bio-hybrid entities could successfully be utilized as contrast agents in vivo in the conventional and multispectral computed tomography (CT). We demonstrated in 'color' the accumulated nanoparticles using advanced detectors of the photon counting CT. The enhanced nano-bio-interfacing capability achieved here can circumvent traditional nanoparticle solubility and delivery problems while offering a patient friendly approach for GI imaging to replace the currently practiced barium meal.;2022;10.1039/d1nh00626f
J;Fingerprint Stimulated Raman Scattering Imaging Reveals Retinoid Coupling Lipid Metabolism and Survival;Retinoids play critical roles in development, immunity, and lipid metabolism, and their deficiency leads to various human disorders. Yet, tools for sensing retinoids in vivo are lacking, which limits the understanding of retinoid distribution, dynamics and functions in living organisms. Here, using hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering microscopy, we discover a previously unknown cytoplasmic store of retinoids in Caenorahbditis elegans. Following the temporal dynamics of retinoids, we reveal that their levels are positively correlated with fat storage, and their supplementation slows down fat loss during starvation. We also discover that retinoids promote fat unsaturation in response to high-glucose stress, and improve organism survival. Together, our studies report a new method for tracking the spatiotemporal dynamics of retinoids in living organisms, and suggest the crucial roles of retinoids in maintaining metabolic homeostasis and enhancing organism fitness upon developmental and dietary stresses.;2018;10.1002/cphc.201800545
C;Developing gold nanotubes as photoacoustic contrast agents;Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) combines the spectral selectivity of laser excitation with the high resolution of ultrasound imaging, representing a noninvasive modality that holds remarkable potential for clinical translation. In particular, multispectral optoacoustic tomography has emerged has an innovative PAI technology, which enables high detection specificity by resolving multiple spectral signatures through tissues and accurately decomposing the biodistribution of relevant molecules from non-specific background contributions. Key criteria for developing PAI contrast agents include strong absorbance in the near-infrared (NIR) tissue transparent region and low toxicity. In this study, we have fabricated gold nanotubes (Au NTs) with controlled length and NIR absorption for the application as in vivo MSOT contrast agents. The length control relies on the synthesis of silver nanorod template under certain growth conditions. The Au NTs were coated with a layer of biocompatible polymer, poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS), to ensure colloidal stability and low cytotoxicity. The PSS-Au NTs have shown excellent MSOT signal enhancement on tissue-mimicking phantom and in vivo, demonstrating the potential for further development towards a theranostic nanoplatform integrating PAI capability and therapeutic functions.;2019;10.1088/1742-6596/1151/1/012018
C;Conjugation of Fiber-coupled Wide-band Light Sources and Acousto-optical Spectral Elements;Endoscopic instrumentation is widely used for diagnostics and surgery. The imaging systems, which provide the hyperspectral information of the tissues accessible by endoscopes, are particularly interesting and promising for in vivo photoluminescence diagnostics and therapy of tumour and inflammatory diseases. To add the spectral imaging feature to standard video endoscopes, we propose to implement acousto-optical (AO) filtration of wide-band illumination of incandescent-lamp-based light sources. To collect maximum light and direct it to the fiber-optic light guide inside the endoscopic probe, we have developed and tested the optical system for coupling the light source, the acousto-optical tunable filter (AOTF) and the light guide. The system is compact and compatible with the standard endoscopic components.;2017;10.1117/12.2297608
J;Learned spectral decoloring enables photoacoustic oximetry;The ability of photoacoustic imaging to measure functional tissue properties, such as blood oxygenation sO2, enables a wide variety of possible applications. sO2 can be computed from the ratio of oxyhemoglobin HbO2 and deoxyhemoglobin Hb, which can be distuinguished by multispectral photoacoustic imaging due to their distinct wavelength-dependent absorption. However, current methods for estimating sO2 yield inaccurate results in realistic settings, due to the unknown and wavelength-dependent influence of the light fluence on the signal. In this work, we propose learned spectral decoloring to enable blood oxygenation measurements to be inferred from multispectral photoacoustic imaging. The method computes sO2 pixel-wise, directly from initial pressure spectra Sp0(lambda ,x), which represent initial pressure values at a fixed spatial location x over all recorded wavelengths lambda. The method is compared to linear unmixing approaches, as well as pO2 and blood gas analysis reference measurements. Experimental results suggest that the proposed method is able to obtain sO2 estimates from multispectral photoacoustic measurements in silico, in vitro, and in vivo.;2021;10.1038/s41598-021-83405-8
J;Magnetic resonance-guided near-infrared tomography of the breast;The design and implementation of a multispectral, frequency-domain near infrared tomography system is outlined, which operates in a MRI magnet for utilization of MR-guided image reconstruction of tissue optical properties. Using long silica optical fiber bundles, measurements of light transmission through up to 12 cm of female breast tissue can be acquired simultaneously with MRI scans. The NIR system utilizes six optical wavelengths from 660 to 850 nm using intensity modulated diode lasers nominally working at 100 MHz. Photomultiplier tube detector gain levels are electronically controlled on a time scale of 200 ms, thereby allowing rapid switching of the source to locations around the tissue. There are no moving parts in the detection channels and for each source position, 15 PMTs operating in parallel allow sensitivity down to 0.5 pW/cm(2) at the tissue surface. Images of breast tissue optical absorption and reduced scattering coefficients are obtained using a Newton-type reconstruction algorithm to solve for an optimal solution using the measurement data. In medical imaging, it is beneficial to compare the same tissue volume as seen by a variety of modalities, and perhaps more importantly, there is the hypothesis that one imaging system which has high spatial resolution can be used to enhance the reconstruction of another system which has good contrast resolution. In this study we explore the synergistic benefits of a combined NIR-MRI data set, specifically the ways in which MRI (i.e., high spatial resolution) enhances NIR (i.e., high contrast resolution) image reconstruction. The design, calibration, and performance of the imaging system are described in the context of preliminary phantom tests and initial in vivo patient imaging. Co-registered MRI validates and improves optical property estimation in 2D tomographic image reconstructions when specialized algorithms are used.

J;CreLite: An optogenetically controlled Cre/loxPsystem using red light;Background: Precise manipulation of gene expression with temporal and spatial control is essential for functional analysis and determining cell lineage relationships in complex biological systems. The cyclic recombinase (Cre)-loxP system is commonly used for gene manipulation at desired times and places. However, specificity is dependent on the availability of tissue- or cell-specific regulatory elements used in combination with Cre. Here, we present CreLite, an optogenetically controlled Cre system using red light in developing zebrafish embryos. Results: Cre activity is disabled by splitting Cre and fusing with theArabidopsis thalianared light-inducible binding partners, PhyB and PIF6. Upon red light illumination, the PhyB-CreC and PIF6-CreN fusion proteins come together in the presence of the cofactor phycocyanobilin (PCB) to restore Cre activity. Red light exposure of zebrafish embryos harboring a Cre-dependent multicolor fluorescent protein reporter injected with CreLite mRNAs and PCB resulted in Cre activity as measured by the generation of multispectral cell labeling in several different tissues. Conclusions: Our data show that CreLite can be used for gene manipulations in whole embryos or small groups of cells at different developmental stages, and suggests CreLite may also be useful for temporal and spatial control of gene expression in cell culture, ex vivo organ culture, and other animal models.;2020;10.1002/dvdy.232
J;Systematic study of target localization for bioluminescence tomography guided radiation therapy;Purpose: To overcome the limitation of CT/cone-beam CT (CBCT) in guiding radiation for soft tissue targets, the authors developed a spectrally resolved bioluminescence tomography (BLT) system for the small animal radiation research platform. The authors systematically assessed the performance of the BLT system in terms of target localization and the ability to resolve two neighboring sources in simulations, tissue-mimicking phantom, and in vivo environments. Methods: Multispectral measurements acquired in a single projection were used for the BLT reconstruction. The incomplete variables truncated conjugate gradient algorithm with an iterative permissible region shrinking strategy was employed as the optimization scheme to reconstruct source distributions. Simulation studies were conducted for single spherical sources with sizes from 0.5 to 3 mm radius at depth of 3-12 mm. The same configuration was also applied for the double source simulation with source separations varying from 3 to 9 mm. Experiments were performed in a standalone BLT/CBCT system. Two self-illuminated sources with 3 and 4.7 mm separations placed inside a tissue-mimicking phantom were chosen as the test cases. Live mice implanted with single-source at 6 and 9 mm depth, two sources at 3 and 5 mm separation at depth of 5 mm, or three sources in the abdomen were also used to illustrate the localization capability of the BLT system for multiple targets in vivo. Results: For simulation study, approximate 1 mm accuracy can be achieved at localizing center of mass (CoM) for single-source and grouped CoM for double source cases. For the case of 1.5 mm radius source, a common tumor size used in preclinical study, their simulation shows that for all the source separations considered, except for the 3 mm separation at 9 and 12 mm depth, the two neighboring sources can be resolved at depths from 3 to 12 mm. Phantom experiments illustrated that 2D bioluminescence imaging failed to distinguish two sources, but BLT can provide 3D source localization with approximately 1 mm accuracy. The in vivo results are encouraging that 1 and 1.7 mm accuracy can be attained for the single-source case at 6 and 9 mm depth, respectively. For the 2 sources in vivo study, both sources can be distinguished at 3 and 5 mm separations, and approximately 1 mm localization accuracy can also be achieved. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that their multispectral BLT/CBCT system could be potentially applied to localize and resolve multiple sources at wide range of source sizes, depths, and separations. The average accuracy of localizing CoM for single-source and grouped CoM for double sources is approximately 1 mm except deep-seated target. The information provided in this study can be instructive to devise treatment margins for BLT-guided irradiation. These results also suggest that the 3D BLT system could guide radiation for the situation with multiple targets, such as metastatic tumor models.

J;Label-Free Detection of Insulin and Glucagon within Human Islets of Langerhans Using Raman Spectroscopy;Intrahepatic transplantation of donor islets of Langerhans is a promising therapy for patients with type 1 diabetes. It is of critical importance to accurately monitor islet quality before transplantation, which is currently done by standard histological methods that are performed off-line and require extensive sample preparation. As an alternative, we propose Raman spectroscopy which is a non-destructive and label-free technique that allows continuous real-time monitoring of the tissue to study biological changes as they occur. By performing Raman spectroscopic measurements on purified insulin and glucagon, we showed that the 520 cm(-1) band assigned to disulfide bridges in insulin, and the 1552 cm(-1) band assigned to tryptophan in glucagon are mutually exclusive and could therefore be used as indirect markers for the label-free distinction between both hormones. High-resolution hyperspectral Raman imaging for these bands showed the distribution of disulfide bridges and tryptophan at sub-micrometer scale, which correlated with the location of insulin and glucagon as revealed by conventional immunohistochemistry. As a measure for this correlation, quantitative analysis was performed comparing the Raman images with the fluorescence images, resulting in Dice coefficients (ranging between 0 and 1) of 0.36 for insulin and 0.19 for glucagon. Although the use of separate microscope systems with different spatial resolution and the use of indirect Raman markers cause some image mismatch, our findings indicate that Raman bands for disulfide bridges and tryptophan can be used as distinctive markers for the label-free detection of insulin and glucagon in human islets of Langerhans.;2013;10.1371/journal.pone.0078148
J;Development of a blood oxygenation phantom for photoacoustic tomography combined with online pO(2) detection and flow spectrometry;Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is intrinsically sensitive to blood oxygen saturation (sO(2)) in vivo. However, making accurate sO(2) measurements without knowledge of tissue- and instrumentation-related correction factors is extremely challenging. We have developed a low-cost flow phantom to facilitate validation of PAT systems. The phantom is composed of a flow circuit of tubing partially embedded within a tissue-mimicking material, with independent sensors providing online monitoring of the optical absorption spectrum and partial pressure of oxygen in the tube. We first test the flow phantom using two small molecule dyes that are frequently used for photoacoustic imaging: methylene blue and indocyanine green. We then demonstrate the potential of the phantom for evaluating sO(2) using chemical oxygenation and deoxygenation of blood in the circuit. Using this dynamic assessment of the photoacoustic sO(2) measurement in phantoms in relation to a ground truth, we explore the influence of multispectral processing and spectral coloring on accurate assessment of sO(2). Future studies could exploit this low-cost dynamic flow phantom to validate fluence correction algorithms and explore additional blood parameters such as pH and also absorptive and other properties of different fluids.

J;Transmission-reflection optoacoustic ultrasound (TROPUS) computed tomography of small animals;Rapid progress in the development of multispectral optoacoustic tomography techniques has enabled unprecedented insights into biological dynamics and molecular processes in vivo and noninvasively at penetration and spatiotemporal scales not covered by modern optical microscopy methods. Ultrasound imaging provides highly complementary information on elastic and functional tissue properties and further aids in enhancing optoacoustic image quality. We devised the first hybrid transmission-reflection optoacoustic ultrasound (TROPUS) small animal imaging platform that combines optoacoustic tomography with both reflection- and transmission-mode ultrasound computed tomography. The system features full-view cross-sectional tomographic imaging geometry for concomitant noninvasive mapping of the absorbed optical energy, acoustic reflectivity, speed of sound, and acoustic attenuation in whole live mice with submillimeter resolution and unrivaled image quality. Graphics-processing unit (GPU)-based algorithms employing spatial compounding and bent-ray-tracing iterative reconstruction were further developed to attain real-time rendering of ultrasound tomography images in the full-ring acquisition geometry. In vivo mouse imaging experiments revealed fine details on the organ parenchyma, vascularization, tissue reflectivity, density, and stiffness. We further used the speed of sound maps retrieved by the transmission ultrasound tomography to improve optoacoustic reconstructions via two-compartment modeling. The newly developed synergistic multimodal combination offers unmatched capabilities for imaging multiple tissue properties and biomarkers with high resolution, penetration, and contrast.;2019;10.1038/s41377-019-0130-5
J;Characterization in respect to degradation of titanium-coated polypropylene surgical mesh explanted from humans;Titanium-coated polypropylene (Ti-PP) mesh was introduced in 2002 as a surgical mesh for the treatment of hernias and shortly after for pelvic floor surgery, with the aim of improving biocompatibility when compared to non-titanised/regular PP mesh implants. The application of a titanium coating could also be beneficial to address concerns regarding the exposure of PP in an in vivo environment. Many studies have shown that PP, although it is widely accepted as a stable polymer, is subject to oxidation and degradation, such degradation affects the mechanical behavior, that is, the stiffness and tensile strength of PP mesh. Despite the wide clinical use of Ti-PP surgical meshes, no study has yet investigated the residual material properties post clinical deployment and subsequent explantation. In this study, two explanted Ti-PP mesh samples each having different incorporation durations from two patients were examined. Material analysis conducted within this study includes the following techniques: attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, low voltage - scanning electron microscopy (LV-SEM), backscattered electron (BSE) imaging, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and secondary election hyperspectral imaging (SEHI). The hypothesis of this study is that the Ti coating successfully shields the PP mesh from oxidative stress in vivo and thus protects it from degradation. The results of this analysis show for the first time evidence of bulk oxidation, surface degradation, and environmental stress cracking on explanted Ti-PP meshes.;;10.1002/jbm.b.35221
J;Photoacoustic tomography for assessment and quantification of cutaneous and metastatic malignant melanoma-A systematic review;Background: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is an emerging noninvasive imaging technique combining high sensitivity optical absorption contrast, such as melanin, with high-resolution ultrasound for deep tissue imaging. The ability of PAT to provide real-time images of skin structures at depth has been studied for diagnosis of primary and metastatic malignant melanoma (MM). Objective: To provide an overview of the rapidly expanding clinical use of PAT for determination of melanoma thickness and architecture, visualization of metastases in lymph nodes and detection of circulating melanoma cells. Methods: Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library were searched for papers using PAT to assess cutaneous malignant melanoma and melanoma metastases in humans or human specimens. Results: The research resulted in 14 articles which met the search criteria. Conclusions: Results from current studies suggest that PAT is a promising tool for assessing both primary and metastatic malignant melanoma in the clinic. The potential of PAT to noninvasively visualize tumour boundaries, as well as assist in the evaluation of metastatic status, could facilitate more effective treatment, resulting in better clearance and reducing the need for additional biopsies. However, larger and methodologically sound studies are warranted.;2021;10.1016/j.pdpdt.2020.102095
J;Precapillary Oxygenation Contributes Relevantly to Gas Exchange in the Intact Lung;Rationale: Oxygen uptake is the elemental function of the lung. However, current understanding of this process has largely been derived from theoretical considerations and measurements of global pulmonary gas exchange. Objectives: To report the direct visualization of pulmonary oxygen uptake in vivo and its use for the analysis of temporal and spatial oxygenation profiles along individual arteriovenous pathways in lungs of healthy and chronic hypoxic mice. Methods: A murine model for intravital microscopy of the breathing lung under sealed thorax conditions was combined with multispectral oximetry for two-dimensional oxygen saturation mapping. This combination allowed for visualization of the blood oxygenation process from pulmonary arterioles to capillaries and venules in two-dimensional oxygen saturation maps. Measurements and Main Results: Temporal and spatial oxygenation profiles revealed that oxygenation occurs within 100 milliseconds over a distance of approximately 130 mu m in the pulmonary microvasculature of the anesthetized mouse. About 50% of total oxygen uptake takes place in precapillary arterioles of less than 30 mm in diameter before the blood enters the alveolar capillary bed. In chronic hypoxic mice, precapillary oxygenation was significantly attenuated as a result of the widened transarteriolar diffusion distance. Conclusions: Oxygen saturation mapping in the intact lung yields unique insights into the temporal and spatial characteristics of pulmonary gas exchange in intact and diseased lungs. Precapillary gas exchange contributes importantly to blood oxygenation at rest, but is attenuated in remodeled lung arterioles, which may be of relevance in pulmonary hypertension.;2013;10.1164/rccm.201212-2177OC
J;NIR nanoprobe-facilitated cross-referencing manifestation of local disease biology for dynamic therapeutic response assessment;Pharmacological interventions for effective treatment require opportune, dynamic and accurate manifestation of pathological status. Traditional clinical techniques relying on biopsy-based histological examinations and blood tests are dramatically restricted due to their invasiveness, unsatisfactory precision, non-real-time reporting and risk of complications. Although current strategies through molecular imaging enable non-invasive and spatiotemporal mapping of pathological changes in intact organisms, environment-activatable, sensitive and quantitative sensing platforms, especially for dynamic feedback of the therapeutic response, are still urgently desired in practice. Herein, we innovatively integrate deep-tissue penetrable multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) and near-infrared (NIR) optical imaging based technology by tailoring a free radical-responsive chromophore with photon-upconverting nanocrystals. During the therapeutic process, the specific reactions between the drug-stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and radical-sensitive probes result in an absorption shift, which can be captured by MSOT. Meanwhile, the radical-triggered reaction also induces multispectral upconversion luminescence (UCL) responses that exhibit the opposite trend in comparison to MSOT. Such reversed-ratiometric dual-modal imaging outcomes provide an ideal cross-referencing system that guarantees the maximum sensing specificity and sensitivity, thus enabling precise disease biology evaluation and treatment assessments in vivo.;2020;10.1039/c9sc04909f
J;Dual near-infrared II laser modulates the cellular redox state of T cells and augments the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy;Immunotherapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, has revolutionized cancer treatment, but only a minor fraction of patients shows durable responses. A new approach to overcome this limitation is yet to be identified. Recently, we have shown that photobiomodulation (PBM) with near-infrared (NIR) light in the NIR-II window reduces oxidative stress and supports the proliferation of CD8(+) T cells, suggesting that PBM with NIR-II light could augment anti-cancer immunity. Here, we report a novel approach to support tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells upon PBM with NIR-II laser with high tissue penetration depth. Brief treatments of a murine model of breast cancer with dual 1064 and 1270 nm lasers reduced the expression of the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) in CD8(+) T cells in a syngeneic mouse model of breast cancer. The direct effect of the NIR-II laser treatment on T cells was confirmed by the enhanced tumor growth delay by the adoptive transfer of laser-treated CD8(+) T cells ex vivo against a model tumor antigen. We further demonstrated that specific NIR-II laser parameters augmented the effect of the immune checkpoint inhibitor on tumor growth. PBM with NIR-II light augments the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy by supporting CD8(+) T cells. Unlike the current immunotherapy with risks of undesirable drug-drug interactions and severe adverse events, the laser is safe and low-cost. It can be broadly combined with other therapy without modification to achieve clinical significance. In addition, our study established a path to develop a novel laser-based therapy to treat cancer effectively.;2022;10.1096/fj.202200033R
J;The molecular and physiological consequences of cold plasma treatment in murine skin and its barrier function;Cold plasma technology is an emerging tool facilitating the spatially controlled delivery of a multitude of reactive species (ROS) to the skin. While the therapeutic efficacy of plasma treatment has been observed in several types of diseases, the fundamental consequences of plasma-derived ROS on skin physiology remain unknown. We aimed to bridge this gap since the epidermal skin barrier and perfusion plays a vital role in health and disease by maintaining homeostasis and protecting from environmental damage. The intact skin of SKH1 mice was plasma-treated in vivo. Gene and protein expression was analyzed utilizing transcriptomics, qPCR, and Western blot. Immunofluorescence aided the analysis of percutaneous skin penetration of curcumin. Tissue oxygenation, perfusion, hemoglobin, and water index was investigated using hyperspectral imaging. Reversed-phase liquidchromatography/mass spectrometry was performed for the identification of changes in the lipid composition and oxidation. Transcriptomic analysis of plasma-treated skin revealed modulation of genes involved in regulating the junctional network (tight, adherence, and gap junctions), which was confirmed using qPCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence imaging. Plasma treatment increased the disaggregation of cells in the stratum corneum (SC) concomitant with increased tissue oxygenation, gap junctional intercellular communication, and penetration of the model drug curcumin into the SC preceded by altered oxidation of skin lipids and their composition in vivo. In summary, plasma-derived ROS modify the junctional network, which promoted tissue oxygenation, oxidation of SC-lipids, and restricted penetration of the model drug curcumin, implicating that plasma may provide a novel and sensitive tool of skin barrier regulation.;2020;10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2020.09.026
C;Multi-wavelength Fluorescence Tomography;The strong scattering and absorption of light in biological tissue makes it challenging to model the propagation of light, especially in deep tissue. This is especially true in fluorescent tomography, which aims to recover the internal fluorescence source distribution from the measured light intensities on the surface of the tissue. The inherently ill-posed and underdetermined nature of the inverse problem along with strong tissue scattering makes Fluorescence Tomography (FT) extremely challenging. Previously, multispectral detection fluorescent tomography (FT) has been shown to improve the image quality of FT by incorporating the spectral filtering of biological tissue to provide depth information to overcome the inherent absorption and scattering limitations. We investigate whether multi-wavelength fluorescent tomography can be used to distinguish the signals from multiple fluorophores with overlapping fluorescence spectrums using a unique near-infrared (NIR) swept laser. In this work, a small feasibility study was performed to see whether multi-wavelength FT can be used to detect subtle shifts in the absorption spectrum due to differences in fluorophore microenvironment.;2016;10.1117/12.2213816
J;Quantum dots trace lymphatic drainage from the mouse eye;Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in the world, often associated with elevated eye pressure. Currently, all glaucoma treatments aim to lower eye pressure by improving fluid exit from the eye. We recently reported the presence of lymphatics in the human eye. The lymphatic circulation is known to drain fluid from organ tissues and, as such, lymphatics may also play a role in draining fluid from the eye. We investigated whether lymphatic drainage from the eye is present in mice by visualizing the trajectory of quantum dots once injected into the eye. Whole-body hyperspectral fluorescence imaging was performed in 17 live mice. In vivo imaging was conducted prior to injection, and 5, 20, 40 and 70 min, and 2, 6 and 24 h after injection. A quantum dot signal was observed in the left neck region at 6 h after tracer injection into the eye. Examination of immunofluorescence-labelled sections using confocal microscopy showed the presence of a quantum dot signal in the left submandibular lymph node. This is the first direct evidence of lymphatic drainage from the mouse eye. The use of quantum dots to image this lymphatic pathway in vivo is a novel tool to stimulate new treatments to reduce eye pressure and prevent blindness from glaucoma.;2011;10.1088/0957-4484/22/42/425101
J;Quantitative intrinsic auto-cathodoluminescence can resolve spectral signatures of tissue-isolated collagen extracellular matrix;By analyzing isolated collagen gel samples, we demonstrated in situ detection of spectrally deconvoluted auto-cathodoluminescence signatures of specific molecular content with precise spatial localization over a maximum field of view of 300 mu m. Correlation of the secondary electron and the hyperspectral images proved similar to 40 nm resolution in the optical channel, obtained due to a short carrier diffusion length, suppressed by fibril dimensions and poor electrical conductivity specific to their organic composition. By correlating spectrally analyzed auto-cathodoluminescence with mass spectroscopy data, we differentiated spectral signatures of two extracellular matrices, namely human fibrin complex and rat tail collagen isolate, and uncovered differences in protein distributions of isolated extracellular matrix networks of heterogeneous populations. Furthermore, we demonstrated that cathodoluminescence can monitor the progress of a human cell-mediated remodeling process, where human collagenous matrix was deposited within a rat collagenous matrix. The revealed change of the heterogeneous biological composition was confirmed by mass spectroscopy.;2019;10.1038/s42003-019-0313-x
J;Cerebral Hypoperfusion-Assisted Intra-arterial Deposition of Liposomes in Normal and Glioma-Bearing Rats;BACKGROUND: Optimizing liposomal vehicles for targeted delivery to the brain has important implications for the treatment of brain tumors. The promise of efficient, brain-specific delivery of chemotherapeutic compounds via liposomal vehicles has yet to be achieved in clinical practice. Intra-arterial injection of specially designed liposomes may facilitate efficient delivery to the brain and to gliomas. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that cationic liposomes may be effectively delivered to both normal and glioma-bearing brain tissue utilizing a strategy of intra-arterial injection during transient cerebral hypoperfusion. METHODS: Cationic, anionic, and neutral liposomes were separately injected via the internal carotid artery of healthy rats during transient cerebral hypoperfusion. Rats bearing C6 gliomas were similarly injected with cationic liposomes. Liposomes were loaded with DilC(18)(5) dye whose concentrations can be measured by light absorbance and fluorescence methods. RESULTS: After intra-arterial injection, a robust uptake of cationic in comparison with anionic and neutral liposomes into brain parenchyma was observed by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Postmortem multispectral fluorescence imaging revealed that liposomal cationic charge was associated with more efficient delivery to the brain. Cationic liposomes were also readily observed within glioma tissue after intra-arterial injection. However, over time, cationic liposomes were retained longer and at higher concentrations in the surrounding, peritumoral brain than in the tumor core. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the feasibility of cationic liposome delivery to brain and glioma tissue after intra-arterial injection. Highly cationic liposomes directly delivered to the brain via an intracarotid route may represent an effective method for delivering antiglioma agents.;2015;10.1227/NEU.0000000000000552
J;Application of intravital microscopy in studies of tumor microcirculation;To grow and progress, solid tumors develop a vascular network through co-option and angiogenesis that is characterized by multiple structural and functional abnormalities, which negatively influence therapeutic outcome through direct and indirect mechanisms. As such, the morphology and function of tumor blood vessels, plus their response to different treatments, are a vital and active area of biological research. Intravital microscopy (IVM) has played a key role in studies of tumor angiogenesis, and ongoing developments in molecular probes, imaging techniques, and postimage analysis methods have ensured its continued and widespread use. In this review we discuss some of the primary advantages and disadvantages of IVM approaches and describe recent technological advances in optical microscopy (e.g., confocal microscopy, multiphoton microscopy, hyperspectral imaging, and optical coherence tomography) with examples of their application to studies of tumor angiogenesis.

J;Multifunctional Nanocarriers for diagnostics, drug delivery and targeted treatment across blood-brain barrier: perspectives on tracking and neuroimaging;Nanotechnology has brought a variety of new possibilities into biological discovery and clinical practice. In particular, nano-scaled carriers have revolutionalized drug delivery, allowing for therapeutic agents to be selectively targeted on an organ, tissue and cell specific level, also minimizing exposure of healthy tissue to drugs. In this review we discuss and analyze three issues, which are considered to be at the core of nano-scaled drug delivery systems, namely functionalization of nanocarriers, delivery to target organs and in vivo imaging. The latest developments on highly specific conjugation strategies that are used to attach biomolecules to the surface of nanoparticles (NP) are first reviewed. Besides drug carrying capabilities, the functionalization of nanocarriers also facilitate their transport to primary target organs. We highlight the leading advantage of nanocarriers, i.e. their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a tightly packed layer of endothelial cells surrounding the brain that prevents high-molecular weight molecules from entering the brain. The BBB has several transport molecules such as growth factors, insulin and transferrin that can potentially increase the efficiency and kinetics of brain-targeting nanocarriers. Potential treatments for common neurological disorders, such as stroke, tumours and Alzheimer's, are therefore a much sought-after application of nanomedicine. Likewise any other drug delivery system, a number of parameters need to be registered once functionalized NPs are administered, for instance their efficiency in organ-selective targeting, bioaccumulation and excretion. Finally, direct in vivo imaging of nanomaterials is an exciting recent field that can provide real-time tracking of those nanocarriers. We review a range of systems suitable for in vivo imaging and monitoring of drug delivery, with an emphasis on most recently introduced molecular imaging modalities based on optical and hybrid contrast, such as fluorescent protein tomography and multispectral optoacoustic tomography. Overall, great potential is foreseen for nanocarriers in medical diagnostics, therapeutics and molecular targeting. A proposed roadmap for ongoing and future research directions is therefore discussed in detail with emphasis on the development of novel approaches for functionalization, targeting and imaging of nano-based drug delivery systems, a cutting-edge technology poised to change the ways medicine is administered.;2010;10.1186/1743-8977-7-3
J;Micro-Raman spectroscopy of lipid halo and dense-core amyloid plaques: aging process characterization in the Alzheimer's disease APPswePS1 Delta E9 mouse model;The deposition of amyloid plaques is considered one of the main microscopic features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since plaque formation can precede extensive neurodegeneration and it is the main clinical manifestation of AD, it constitutes a relevant target for new treatment and diagnostic approaches. Micro-Raman spectroscopy, a label-free technique, is an accurate method for amyloid plaque identification and characterization. Here, we present a high spatial resolution micro-Raman hyperspectral study in transgenic APPswePS1 Delta E9 mouse brains, showing details of AD tissue biochemical and histological changes without staining. First we used stimulated micro-Raman scattering to identify the lipid-rich halo surrounding the amyloid plaque, and then proceeded with spontaneous (conventional) micro-Raman spectral mapping, which shows a cholesterol and sphingomyelin lipid-rich halo structure around dense-core amyloid plaques. The detailed images of this lipid halo relate morphologically well with dystrophic neurites surrounding plaques. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the micro-Raman hyperspectral data indicates the feasibility of the optical biomarkers of AD progression with the potential for discriminating transgenic groups of young adult mice (6-month-old) from older ones (12-month-old). Frequency-specific PCA suggests that plaque-related neurodegeneration is the predominant change captured by Raman spectroscopy, and the main differences are highlighted by vibrational modes associated with cholesterol located majorly in the lipid halo.;2021;10.1039/d1an01078f
J;Optical imaging for cervical cancer detection: solutions for a continuing global problem;Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for women in developing countries. Optical technologies can improve the accuracy and availability of cervical cancer screening. For example, battery-powered digital cameras can obtain multi- spectral images of the entire cervix, highlighting suspicious areas, and high-resolution optical technologies can further interrogate such areas, providing in vivo diagnosis with high sensitivity and specificity. In addition, targeted contrast agents can highlight changes in biomarkers of cervical neoplasia. Such advances should provide a much needed global approach to cervical cancer prevention.;2008;10.1038/nrc2462
C;Novel integrated bio-optical system for oxygen saturation measurement;"The time resolved/time gated method can be used as a non-invasive technique for measuring changes in the concentration of oxy-and deoxy-hemoglobin in tissues by monitoring absorbed near infrared (NIR) signals in diffusion-reflectance and trans-illuminescence geometries. The objective is to develop novel technology that would enhance the efficiency of sensing in intact organism, in vivo, offering new capabilities for studying biological function by multispectral spectroscopy [1-4]. In this paper, we describe a novel scheme of an excitation source that enhances the spatial resolution and signal to noise ratio of detected NIR absorbed signals in diffusion reflectance spectroscopy technique used for measuring changes in the concentration of oxy-and deoxy-hemoglobin in tissues. We identify the properties and application of long visible and IR wavelength Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser as an alternative 'Excitation Source'. We also investigate the Jitter performance of VCSELs in a high rate transmission systems like; the time gated reflectance absorbance spectroscopy system, as timing jitter of excitation source seriously degrades the temporal resolution of the collected absorbed luminescence at the detector end, which significantly effects the proper monitoring of the changes in the concentration of oxy-and deoxy-hemoglobin within the tissue.";2004;10.1117/12.528651
J;Multimodal Photoacoustic Tomography;Currently available optical microscopic imaging techniques-confocal microscopy, multi-photon (also referred to as two-photon) microscopy, and optical coherence tomography-have revolutionized biological and medical research, based on strong optical contrast and high spatial resolution. Unfortunately, owing to unavoidable strong light scattering in biological tissues, such methods cannot maintain contrast and spatial resolution beyond one optical transport mean free path (mm in tissues). Although model-based diffuse optical tomography is able to operate at greater depths, this technique fails to maintain spatial resolution. Photoacoustic tomography overcomes the fundamental penetration depth problem and achieves high-resolution optical imaging in deep tissues by combing light and ultrasound. In this review article, the multimodal imaging capability of photoacoustic tomography, integrated with existing imaging tools, is contemplated and the potential preclinical and clinical impacts of the combined systems are discussed.;2013;10.1109/TMM.2013.2244203
J;Infrared Fluorescent Protein 1.4 Genetic Labeling Tracks Engrafted Cardiac Progenitor Cells in Mouse Ischemic Hearts;Stem cell therapy has a potential for regenerating damaged myocardium. However, a key obstacle to cell therapy's success is the loss of engrafted cells due to apoptosis or necrosis in the ischemic myocardium. While many strategies have been developed to improve engrafted cell survival, tools to evaluate cell efficacy within the body are limited. Traditional genetic labeling tools, such as GFP-like fluorescent proteins (eGFP, DsRed, mCherry), have limited penetration depths in vivo due to tissue scattering and absorption. To circumvent these limitations, a near-infrared fluorescent mutant of the DrBphP bacteriophytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans, IFP1.4, was developed for in vivo imaging, but it has yet to be used for in vivo stem/progenitor cell tracking. In this study, we incorporated IFP1.4 into mouse cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) by a lentiviral vector. Live IFP1.4-labeled CPCs were imaged by their near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) using an Odyssey scanner following overnight incubation with biliverdin. A significant linear correlation was observed between the amount of cells and NIRF signal intensity in in vitro studies. Lentiviral mediated IFP1.4 gene labeling is stable, and does not impact the apoptosis and cardiac differentiation of CPC. To assess efficacy of our model for engrafted cells in vivo, IFP1.4-labeled CPCs were intramyocardially injected into infarcted hearts. NIRF signals were collected at 1-day, 7-days, and 14-days post-injection using the Kodak in vivo multispectral imaging system. Strong NIRF signals from engrafted cells were imaged 1 day after injection. At 1 week after injection, 70% of the NIRF signal was lost when compared to the intensity of the day 1 signal. The data collected 2 weeks following transplantation showed an 88% decrease when compared to day 1. Our studies have shown that IFP1.4 gene labeling can be used to track the viability of transplanted cells in vivo.;2014;10.1371/journal.pone.0107841
J;Clinical translation of ferumoxytol-based vessel size imaging (VSI): Feasibility in a phase I oncology clinical trial population;"PurposeTo assess the feasibility of acquiring vessel size imaging (VSI) metrics using ferumoxytol injections and stock pulse sequences in a multicenter Phase I trial of a novel therapy in patients with advanced metastatic disease. MethodsScans were acquired before, immediately after, and 48h after injection, at screening and after 2 weeks of treatment. R-2, , vessel density (Q), and relative vascular volume fractions (VVF) were estimated in both normal tissue and tumor, and compared with model-derived theoretical and experimental estimates based on preclinical murine xenograft data. Results R-2 and relaxation rates were still significantly elevated in tumors and liver 48h after ferumoxytol injection; liver values returned to baseline by week 2. Q was relatively insensitive to changes in , indicating lack of dependence on contrast agent concentration. Variability in Q was higher among human tumors compared with xenografts and was mostly driven by R-2. Relative VVFs were higher in human tumors compared with xenografts, while values in muscle were similar between species. ConclusionClinical ferumoxytol-based VSI is feasible using standard MRI techniques in a multicenter study of patients with lesions outside of the brain. Ferumoxytol accumulation in the liver does not preclude measurement of VSI parameters in liver metastases. Magn Reson Med 77:814-825, 2017.

J;Photoacoustic breast tomography prototypes with reported human applications;Photoacoustic breast tomography could provide optical molecular imaging with near-infrared light at sonographic image resolution by utilizing the photoacoustic effect. This review summarizes reports about current prototypes that were applied in vivo in humans. Four databases were searched for reports about prototypes of photoacoustic breast tomography that were tested in vivo in humans. Data extracted from the reports comprised details about system design, phantom studies, and clinical studies. Five prototypes were included. System designs comprised planar, hemicylindrical and hemispherical geometries. In total, 52 of 61 breast cancers (85 %) were detected by three of the prototypes, showing image details such as ring-pattern of the haemoglobin-rich tumour vasculature. A refined prototype provided submillimetre resolution at a good contrast-to-noise ratio up to a depth of about 5 cm in a cup-shaped breast configuration. Another novel prototype demonstrated that in the mammographic imaging geometry, the total imaging depth approximately duplicates with bilateral laser illumination. Most prototypes focused on detecting elevated haemoglobin content related to tumours, but proof-of-principle was also given for multispectral optoacoustic tomography by additional imaging of tissue oxygenation. Photoacoustic breast tomography can detect breast cancer. This radiation-free molecular imaging technology should be further refined and studied for clinical applications.;2015;10.1007/s00330-015-3647-x
J;Transcriptional Profiling Identifies Physicochemical Properties of Nanomaterials That Are Determinants of the In Vivo Pulmonary Response;"We applied transcriptional profiling to elucidate the mechanisms associated with pulmonary responses to titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (NPs) of different sizes and surface coatings, and to determine if these responses are modified by NP size, surface area, surface modification, and embedding in paint matrices. Adult C57BL/6 mice were exposed via single intratracheal instillations to free forms of TiO(2)NPs (10, 20.6, or 38 nm in diameter) with different surface coatings, or TiO(2)NPs embedded in paint matrices. Controls were exposed to dispersion medium devoid of NPs. TiO(2)NPs were characterized for size, surface area, chemical impurities, and agglomeration state in the exposure medium. Pulmonary transcriptional profiles were generated using microarrays from tissues collected one and 28 d postexposure. Property-specific pathway effects were identified. Pulmonary protein levels of specific inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were confirmed by ELISA. The data were collapsed to 659 differentially expressed genes (P 0.05; fold change 1.5). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of these genes revealed that TiO(2)NPs clustered mainly by postexposure timepoint followed by particle type. A pathway-based meta-analysis showed that the combination of smaller size, large deposited surface area, and surface amidation contributes to TiO2NP gene expression response. Embedding of TiO2NP in paint dampens the overall transcriptional effects. The magnitude of the expression changes associated with pulmonary inflammation differed across all particles; however, the underlying pathway perturbations leading to inflammation were similar, suggesting a generalized mechanism-of-action for all TiO(2)NPs. Thus, transcriptional profiling is an effective tool to determine the property-specific biological/toxicity responses induced by nanomaterials. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 56:245-264, 2015.

J;Photoacoustic Probes for Molecular Detection: Recent Advances and Perspectives;"Photoacoustic (PA) imaging (PAI) is a noninvasive and nonionizing biomedical imaging modality that combines the advantages of optical imaging and ultrasound imaging. Based on PAI, photoacoustic detection (PAD) is an emerging approach that is involved with the interaction between PA probes and analytes resulting in the changes of photoacoustic signals for molecular detection with rich contrast, high resolution, and deep tissue penetration. This Review focuses on the recent development of PA probes in PAD. The following contents will be discussed in detail: 1) the construction of PA probes; 2) the applications and mechanisms of PAD to different types of analytes, including microenvironments, small biomolecules, or metal ions; 3) the challenges and perspectives of PA probes in PAD.";2018;10.1002/smll.201800782
J;Real-time interleaved spectroscopic photoacoustic and ultrasound (PAUS) scanning with simultaneous fluence compensation and motion correction;For over two decades photoacoustic imaging has been tested clinically, but successful human trials have been limited. To enable quantitative clinical spectroscopy, the fundamental issues of wavelength-dependent fluence variations and inter-wavelength motion must be overcome. Here we propose a real-time, spectroscopic photoacoustic/ultrasound (PAUS) imaging approach using a compact, 1-kHz rate wavelength-tunable laser. Instead of illuminating tissue over a large area, the fiber-optic delivery system surrounding an US array sequentially scans a narrow laser beam, with partial PA image reconstruction for each laser pulse. The final image is then formed by coherently summing partial images. This scheme enables (i) automatic compensation for wavelength-dependent fluence variations in spectroscopic PA imaging and (ii) motion correction of spectroscopic PA frames using US speckle tracking in real-time systems. The 50-Hz video rate PAUS system is demonstrated in vivo using a murine model of labelled drug delivery. Spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging has been limited by wavelength-dependent fluence variations and tissue motion. Here, the authors achieve real-time fluence and motion correction in vivo by using a wavelength-tunable laser, sequential scan of a narrow beam and partial image reconstruction for each pulse.;2021;10.1038/s41467-021-20947-5
C;Near-infrared autofluorescence spectroscopy and photobleaching detection of melanin-pigmented cutaneous neoplasia;In the current study, an excitation laser source emitting at 785 nm (100 mW, CW) was used to obtain ex vivo fluorescence of endogenous melanin in pigmented skin with benign, dysplastic and malignant cutaneous lesions. The samples were obtained after surgical removal during standard excision procedure and split for spectral analysis and histological verification. The samples of benign (BN-5) and dysplastic (DN-3) nevi and of malignant melanoma (MM-7) were used as representative for harmless/harmful cutaneous neoplasia with a similar melanin pigmentation. Emission in the range 800 - 1100 nm was detected and compared using a USB4000 micro-spectrometer (Ocean Optics Inc., USA). The photobleaching dynamics was observed for the emission maxima at 825 nm for 10 minutes with a step of 20 s. These near-IR autofluorescence spectra may be assigned to a single fluorophore if appropriate excitation wavelength is applied, which simplifies the rapid analysis related to the appearance and concentration evaluation of a given type of endogenous fluorophore, as well as allows the evaluation of some parameters, such as photobleaching dynamics, as a diagnostic indicator assessing the tissue state. A diagnostic accuracy of 93.3% was achieved for MM lesions validation when the NIR fluorescence intensity and photobleaching rate values were used to discriminate between nevi and melanoma lesions.;2021;10.1088/1742-6596/1859/1/012044
