Different intraoperative guidance tools are currently employed during the resection tumor but having several limitations. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is arising as a label-free and non-ionizing technique that could assist neurosurgeons during surgical procedures. In this paper, an analysis between in-vivo and ex-vivo human brain tumor samples using HSI has been performed to evaluate the correlation between both types of samples. Spectral ratios of the oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin were employed to distinguish between normal tissue, tumor tissue and blood vessels. A database composed by seven in-vivo and fourteen ex-vivo hyperspectral images obtained from seven different patients diagnosed with glioblastoma Grade IV, metastatic secondary breast cancer, meningioma Grade I and II, and astrocytoma (glioma) Grade II. 44,964 pixels labeled pixels were employed in this work. The proposed method achieved discrimination between different tissue types using the proposed spectral ratio. Comparison between in-vivo and ex-vivo samples indicated that ex-vivo samples generate higher hemoglobin ratios.

Our spectral imaging system uses autofluorescencent emission from collagen (400 nm) and NAD(P)H (475 nm), as well as, differences in the optical reflectance spectra as diagnostics for differentiating between healthy and diseased tissue. In this study, we demonstrate the ability of our imaging system to discriminate between healthy and damaged porcine epidermal tissue. Healthy porcine epidermal tissue samples (n=11) were imaged ex vivo using our hyperspectral system. The amount of NAD(P) H emission and the reflectance properties were approximately constant across the surface of healthy tissue samples. The tissue samples were then thermally damaged using an 1850 nm thulium fiber laser and re-imaged after laser irradiation. The damaged regions were clearly visible in the hyperspectral images as the thermal damage altered the fluorescent emission of NAD(P) H and changed the scattering properties of the tissue. The extent of the damaged regions was determined based on the hyperspectral images and these estimates were compared to damage extents measured in white light images acquired with a traditional camera. The extent of damage determined via hyperspectral imaging was in good agreement with estimates based on white light imaging indicating that our system is capable of differentiating between healthy and damaged tissue.

The purpose of this study was to validate whether ex vivo multispectral photoacoustic imaging can be used to differentiate malignant tissue, benign nodules, and normal human thyroid tissue. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Fifty patients undergoing thyroidectomy because of thyroid lesions participated in this study. Multispectral photoacoustic imaging was performed on surgically excised thyroid tissue, and chromophore images that represented optical absorption of deoxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, lipid, and water were reconstructed. After the imaging procedure, the pathologist marked malignant tissue, benign nodules, and normal regions on histopathologic slides, and digital images of the marked histopathologic slides were obtained. The histopathologic images were coregistered with chromophore images. Areas corresponding to malignant tissue, benign nodules, and normal tissue were defined on the chromophore images. Pixel values within each area were averaged to determine the mean intensities of deoxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, lipid, and water. RESULTS. There was a statistically significant difference between malignant and benign nodules with respect to mean intensity of deoxyhemoglobin (p = 0.014). There was a difference between malignant and normal tissue in mean intensity of deoxyhemoglobin (p = 0.003), lipid (p = 0.001), and water (p < 0.0001). A difference between benign nodules and normal tissue was found in mean intensity of oxyhemoglobin (p < 0.0001), lipid (p < 0.0001), and water (p < 0.0001). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the system tested in differentiating malignant from nonmalignant thyroid tissue were 69.2%, 96.9%, 81.8%, and 93.9%.

Methods: Hyperspectral autofluorescence emission images were captured between 420 and 720 nm (10-nm intervals), at two excitation bands (436-460, 480-510 nm), from three locations (fovea, perifovea, near-periphery) in 20 normal RPE/Bruch's membrane (BrM) flatmounts. Mathematical factorization extracted a BrM spectrum (S0) and abundant lipofuscin/melanolipofuscin (LF/ML) spectra of RPE origin (S1, S2, S3) from each tissue. Results: Smooth spectra S1 to S3, with perinuclear localization consistent with LF/ML at all three retinal locations and both excitations in 14 eyes (84 datasets), were included in the analysis. The mean peak emissions of S0, S1, and S2 at lambda(ex) 436 nm were, respectively, 495 6 14, 535 6 17, and 576 6 20 nm. S3 was generally trimodal, with peaks at either 580, 620, or 650 nm (peak mode, 650 nm).

To overcome the drawback of reduced tactile feedback, real-time tissue classification could be of great benefit. In this ex vivo study, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) was used to distinguish tumor tissue from healthy surrounding tissue. A sample of fat, healthy colorectal wall, and tumor tissue was collected per patient and imaged using two hyperspectral cameras, covering the wavelength range from 400 to 1700 nm. The data were randomly divided into a training (75%) and test (25%) set. After feature reduction, a quadratic classifier and support vector machine were used to distinguish the three tissue types. Tissue samples of 32 patients were imaged using both hyperspectral cameras. The accuracy to distinguish the three tissue types using both hyperspectral cameras was 0.88 (STD = 0.13) on the test dataset. When the accuracy was determined per patient, a mean accuracy of 0.93 (STD = 0.12) was obtained on the test dataset.

For these operations, it is of utmost importance to remove the whole tumor, since tumor-positive resection margins may result in recurrent disease and impaired overall survival. Current optical imaging techniques using endogenous contrast - e.g. diffuse reflectance spectroscopy or optical coherence tomography - for detection of breast cancers are limited to point measurements or long acquisition times. Broadband hyperspectral cameras, which provide a complete spectral fingerprint of the object at pixel level, are needed for two-dimensional imaging of the operative region. An ex vivo study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of hyperspectral imaging for breast cancer detection. Fresh (<3 hours after surgery) resected breast cancer slices were imaged with a snapshot hyperspectral camera, which has 41 spectral bands, equally distributed in the visible and near-infrared (VIS-NIR) range (450 - 950 nm). Supervised analysis was performed by using the pathology annotations and unsupervised analysis was performed by using the hierarchical stochastic neighbour embedding (h-SNE) algorithm. So far, nine resected specimens, of which six invasive carcinomas and two (partially) mucinous carcinomas, were imaged. Spectral differences were found between the non-tumor, malign and benign regions on the resected specimens. Furthermore, automatic feature classification using h-SNE was possible in selected cases.

While the illuminant spectrum is typically kept constant in laparoscopic surgery and can thus be estimated from preoperative calibration images, a key challenge in open surgery originates from the dynamic changes of lighting conditions. Methods The present paper addresses this challenge with a novel approach to light source calibration based on specular highlight analysis. It involves the acquisition of low-exposure time images serving as a basis for recovering the illuminant spectrum from pixels that contain a dominant specular reflectance component. Results Comprehensive in silico and in vivo experiments with a range of different light sources demonstrate that our approach enables an accurate and robust recovery of the illuminant spectrum in the field of view of the camera, which results in reduced errors with respect to the estimation of functional tissue properties.

Objective: To examine the impacts of ablation zone volume following Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of an exvivo bovine liver to correlate the impacts of thermal ablation with target organ perfusion; by exploiting the unique properties of Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI). Materials and methods: Radiofrequency ablation was perfused on ex-vivo bovine livers at peripheral and central-vessel-adjacent locations, and monitored by HSI with a spectral range from 400 to 1000 nm. The system contains k-means clustering (K = 8) algorithms combining spectral and spatial information. Labeled spectral signatures datasets were used as training data. Statistical analysis (10 samples) was computed to calculate the highest variance between six spectral images for determining the optimum wavelength for discrimination between the affected regions after thermal ablation (normal, thermal, and ablated liver tissue regions). Results: The change of the optical properties of ex-vivo liver tissues provides different responses to light transmission, scattering, absorption and particularly the reflection over the spectrum range. The produced spectral image from reflection with the highest variance (358.07) empowered us to determine the optimum wavelength spectral image (720 +/- 18.92 nm) to distinguish between the normal, ablated, and thermal categories.

One of the main obstacles that researchers find when developing hyperspectral algorithms for medical applications is the lack of specific, publicly available, and hyperspectral medical data. The work described in this paper was developed within the framework of the European project HELICoiD (HypErspectraL Imaging Cancer Detection), which had as a main goal the application of hyperspectral imaging to the delineation of brain tumors in real-time during neurosurgical operations. In this paper, the methodology followed to generate the first hyperspectral database of in-vivo human brain tissues is presented. Data was acquired employing a customized hyperspectral acquisition system capable of capturing information in the Visual and Near InfraRed (VNIR) range from 400 to 1000 nm. Repeatability was assessed for the cases where two images of the same scene were captured consecutively. The analysis reveals that the system works more efficiently in the spectral range between 450 and 900 nm. A total of 36 hyperspectral images from 22 different patients were obtained. From these data, more than 300 000 spectral signatures were labeled employing a semi-automatic methodology based on the spectral angle mapper algorithm.

While ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used as a guidance modality, it often provides insufficient contrast for identifying nerves from surrounding tissues such as tendons. Electrical nerve stimulators can be used in conjunction with US imaging for discriminating nerves from surrounding tissues, but they are insufficient to reliably prevent neural punctures, so that alternative methods are highly desirable. In this study, an interventional multispectral photoacoustic (PA) imaging system was used to directly compare the signal amplitudes and spectra acquired from nerves and tendons ex vivo, for the first time. The results indicate that the system can provide significantly higher image contrast for discriminating nerves and tendons than that provided by US imaging.

These data were normalized at 810 nm (an isobestic wavelength for hemoglobin and oxy-hemoglobin) and mathematically analyzed using total principal component regression (TPCR). Results: 929 spectra were collected from specimens of 19 patients, distinguishing 5 tissue types: mesenteric fat (MF, n=269), blood vessels (BV, n=377), colonic tissue (CT, n=213), ureter (UR, n=10) and tumorous tissue in colon (TT, n=60).

This proof of concept study describes the development of a multispectral imaging (MSI) method called multispectral tissue mapping (MTM) that addresses these issues. Approach: The imaging system consists of a tunable excitation light source and a near-infrared camera. Following the development stage, proof of concept experiments are carried out where absorption spectra from colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver steatosis specimen are acquired and compared to controls. Absorption spectra are compared to histopathology examination as the current gold standard for tissue assessment. Generalized linear mixed modeling is employed to compare absorption characteristics of individual pixels and to select wavelengths for false color image processing with the aim of visually enhancing cancer tissue. Results: Analysis of individual pixels revealed distinct absorption spectra therefore suggesting that MTM is possible. A prominent absorption peak at 1210 nm was found in lipid-rich animal tissues and steatotic liver specimen. Liver cancer tissue had a heterogeneous appearance on MSI. Subsequent statistical analysis suggests that measuring changes in absorption behavior may be a feasible method to estimate the pixel-based probability of cancer being present. In CRLM, this was observed throughout 1100 to 1700 nm, whereas in HCC it was concentrated around 1140 and 1430 nm. False color image processing visibly enhances contrast between cancer and normal liver tissues. Conclusions: The system's ability to enable no-touch MSI at 1100 to 1700 nm was demonstrated.

In this work, a dual modality endoscopic system has been proposed to enable tissue surface shape reconstruction and hyperspectral imaging (HSI). This system centers around a probe comprised of an incoherent fiber bundle, whose fiber arrangement is different at the two ends, and miniature imaging optics. For 3D reconstruction with structured light (SL), a light pattern formed of randomly distributed spots with different colors is projected onto the tissue surface, creating artificial texture. Pattern decoding with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and a customized feature descriptor enables real-time 3D surface reconstruction at approximately 12 frames per second (FPS). In HSI mode, spatially sparse hyperspectral signals from the tissue surface can be captured with a slit hyperspectral imager in a single snapshot. A CNN based super-resolution model, namely super-spectral-resolution network (SSRNet), has also been developed to estimate pixel-level dense hypercubes from the endoscope cameras standard RGB images and the sparse hyperspectral signals, at approximately 2 FPS. The probe, with a 2.1 mm diameter, enables the system to be used with endoscope working channels. Furthermore, since data acquisition in both modes can be accomplished in one snapshot, operation of this system in clinical applications is minimally affected by tissue surface movement and deformation. The whole apparatus has been validated on phantoms and tissue (ex vivo and in vivo), while initial measurements on patients during laryngeal surgery show its potential in real-world clinical applications.

We present a method to emulate the spectral range and resolution of a variety of multispectral imagers, based on in-vivo data acquired from spatial frequency domain spectroscopy (SFDS). This approach simulates spectral responses over 400 to 1100 nm. Comparing emulated data with full SFDS spectra of in-vivo tissue affords the opportunity to evaluate whether the sparse spectral content of these imagers can (1) account for all sources of optical contrast present ( completeness) and (2) robustly separate and quantify sources of optical contrast (crosstalk). We validate the approach over a range of tissue-simulating phantoms, comparing the SFDS-based emulated spectra against measurements from an independently characterized multispectral imager. Emulated results match the imager across all phantoms (< 3% absorption, < 1% reduced scattering). In-vivo test cases (burn wounds and photoaging) illustrate how SFDS can be used to evaluate different multispectral imagers. This approach provides an in-vivo measurement method to evaluate the performance of multispectral imagers specific to their targeted clinical applications and can assist in the design and optimization of new spectral imaging devices.

In the current ex vivo study, we evaluated the feasibility of hyperspectral diffuse reflectance imaging (HSI) for distinguishing tumor from the healthy tongue tissue. Study Design/Materials and Methods Fresh surgical specimens (n = 14) of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue were scanned with two hyperspectral cameras that cover the visible and near-infrared spectrum (400-1,700 nm). Each pixel of the hyperspectral image represents a measure of the diffuse optical reflectance. A neural network was used for tissue-type prediction of the hyperspectral images of the visual and near-infrared data sets separately as well as both data sets combined. Results HSI was able to distinguish tumor from muscle with a good accuracy. The diagnostic performance of both wavelength ranges (sensitivity/specificity of visual and near-infrared were 84%/80% and 77%/77%, respectively) appears to be comparable and there is no additional benefit of combining the two wavelength ranges (sensitivity and specificity were 83%/76%). Conclusions HSI has a strong potential for intra-operative assessment of tumor resection margins of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. This may optimize surgery, as the entire resection surface can be scanned in a single run and the results can be readily available. Lasers Surg. Med.

Undetected residual malignant tissue often results in the need for additional treatment or surgical intervention. The Solaris T platform is a multispectral open-air fluorescence imaging system designed for translational fluorescence-guided surgery. Solaris supports video-rate imaging in four fixed fluorescence channels ranging from visible to near infrared, and a multispectral channel equipped with a liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF) for multispectral image acquisition (520-620 nm). Identification of tumor margins using reagents emitting in the visible spectrum (400-650 nm), such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), present challenges considering the presence of auto-fluorescence from tissue and food in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. To overcome this, Solaris acquires LCTF-based multispectral images, and by applying an automated spectral unmixing algorithm to the data, separates reagent fluorescence from tissue and food auto-fluorescence. The unmixing algorithm uses vertex component analysis to automatically extract the primary pure spectra, and resolves the reagent fluorescent signal using non-negative least squares. For validation, intraoperative in vivo studies were carried out in tumor-bearing rodents injected with FITC-dextran reagent that is primarily residing in malignant tissue 24 hours post injection. In the absence of unmixing, fluorescence from tumors is not distinguishable from that of surrounding tissue. Upon spectral unmixing, the FITC-labeled malignant regions become well defined and detectable.

Among those techniques, photoacoustic imaging (PAI), considered a functional technique, has shown to be promising for the visualization of micromotors in deep tissue with high spatiotemporal resolution as it possesses the molecular specificity of optical methods and the penetration depth of ultrasound. However, the precise maneuvering and function's control of medical micromotors, in particular in living organisms, require both anatomical and functional imaging feedback. Therefore, herein, the use of high-frequency ultrasound and PAI is reported to obtain anatomical and molecular information, respectively, of magnetically-driven micromotors in vitro and under ex vivo tissues. Furthermore, the steerability of the micromotors is demonstrated by the action of an external magnetic field into the uterus and bladder of living mice in real-time, being able to discriminate the micromotors' signal from one of the endogenous chromophores by multispectral analysis. Finally, the successful loading and release of a model cargo by the micromotors toward non-invasive in vivo medical interventions is demonstrated.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "Band selection for oxygenation estimation with multispectral/hyperspectral imaging", "abstract": "Multispectral imaging provides valuable information on tissue composition such as hemoglobin oxygen saturation. However, the real-time application of this technique in interventional medicine can be challenging due to the long acquisition times needed for large amounts of hyperspectral data with hundreds of bands. While this challenge can partially be addressed by choosing a discriminative subset of bands, the band selection methods proposed to date are mainly restricted by the availability of often hard to obtain reference measurements. We address this bottleneck with a new approach to band selection that leverages highly accurate Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. We hypothesize that a so chosen small subset of bands can reproduce or even improve upon the results of a quasi continuous spectral measurement. We further investigate whether novel domain adaptation techniques can address the inevitable domain shift stemming from the use of simulations. Initial results based on in silico and in vivo experiments suggest that 10-20 bands are sufficient to closely reproduce results from spectral measurements with 101 bands in the 500-700 nm range. The investigated domain adaptation technique, which only requires unlabeled in vivo measurements, yielded better results than the pure in silico band selection method.

Optical techniques are currently emerging as tools to directly assess tissue thermal damage. Among them, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has shown promising results in image-guided surgery and in the thermal ablation field. The highly informative data provided by HSI, associated with deep learning, enable the implementation of non-invasive prediction models to be used intraoperatively. Here we show a novel paradigm peak temperature prediction model  (PTPM), convolutional neural network (CNN)-based, trained with HSI and infrared imaging to predict LA-induced damage in the liver. The PTPM demonstrated an optimal agreement with tissue damage classification providing a consistent threshold (50.6 & PLUSMN; 1.5 & DEG;C) for the damage margins with high accuracy (-0.90).

To overcome this, we developed a hyperspectral camera setup to monitor the different optical behavior of tissue types in vivo. The aim of this work is to collect and analyze these behaviors to open up optical opportunities during surgery. Our setup uses a digital camera and several bandpass filters in front of the light source to illuminate different tissue types with 16 specific wavelength ranges. We analyzed the different intensities of eight healthy tissue types over the visible spectrum (400 to 700 nm). Using our setup and sophisticated postprocessing in order to handle motion during capturing, we are able to find tissue characteristics not visible for the human eye to differentiate tissue types in the 16-dimensional wavelength domain. Our analysis shows that this approach has the potential to support the surgeon's decisions during treatment. (C) The Authors.

Tissue samples taken during surgery are either subject to a preliminary intraoperative histological analysis, or sent for a full pathological evaluation which can take days or weeks. Whereas a lengthy complete pathological analysis includes an array of techniques to be executed, a preliminary tissue analysis on frozen tissue is performed as quickly as possible (30-45 minutes on average) to provide fast feedback to the surgeon during the surgery. The surgeon uses the information to confirm that the resected tissue is indeed tumor and may, at least in theory, initiate repeated biopsies to help achieve gross total resection. However, due to the total turn-around time of the tissue inspection for repeated analyses, this approach may not be feasible during a single surgery. In this context, intraoperative image-guided techniques can improve the clinical workflow for tumor resection and improve outcome by aiding in the identification and removal of the malignant lesion. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an optical imaging technique with the potential to extract combined spectral-spatial information. By exploiting HSI for human brain-tissue classification in 13 in-vivo hyperspectral images from 9 patients, a brain-tissue classifier is developed. The framework consists of a hybrid 3D-2D CNN-based approach and a band-selection step to enhance the capability of extracting both spectral and spatial information from the hyperspectral images. An overall accuracy of 77% was found when tumor, normal and hyper-vascularized tissue are classified, which clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches (SVM, 2D-CNN).

Spectral imaging techniques have demonstrated the potential for the measurement of hemodynamics in medical applications. These involve the measurement of reflectance spectra by acquiring images of the tissue in different wavebands. Measures of tissue constituents at each pixel can then be extracted from these spectra through modeling of the light-tissue interaction. A multispectral imaging (MSI) laparoscope was used in sheep and rabbit UTx models to study short-and long-term changes in oxygen saturation following surgery. The whole organ was imaged in the donor and recipient animals in parallel with point measurements from a pulse oximeter. Imaging results confirmed the re-establishment of adequate perfusion in the transplanted organ after surgery. Cornual oxygenation trends measured with MSI are consistent with pulse oximeter readings, showing decreased StO(2) immediately after anastomosis of the blood vessels. Long-term results show recovery of StO2 to preoperative levels. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.

Three samples of Liberkuhn colon adenocarcinomas have been studied: common, mucinous and treated by radiochemotherapy. For each sample, several specific zones have been chosen, based on their visual staging and polarimetric responses, which have been correlated to the histology of the corresponding cuts. The most relevant polarimetric images are those quantifying the depolarization for incident linearly polarized light. The measured depolarization depends on several factors, namely the presence or absence of tumor, its exophytic (budding) or endophytic (penetrating) nature, its thickness (its degree of ulceration) and its level of penetration in deeper layers (submucosa, muscularis externa and serosa). The cellular density, the concentration of stroma, the presence or absence of mucus and the light penetration depth, which increases with wavelength, are also relevant parameters. Our data indicate that the tissues with the lowest and highest depolarizing powers are respectively mucus-free tumoral tissue with high cellular density and healthy serosa, while healthy submucosa, muscularis externa as well as mucinous tumor probably feature intermediate values. Moreover, the specimen coming from a patient treated successfully with radiochemotherapy exhibited a uniform polarimetric response typical of healthy tissue even in the initially pathological zone.

In this work, a commercial hyperspectral (HS) camera, working in the visible and near-infrared spectral range, has been tested for the estimation of thermal damage in the ex vivo liver. Firstly, the optimal experimental setup and settings to evaluate the optical response of tissues with the HSI were identified.

Specifically, the damage was induced by homogeneously heating the tissue until reaching 50.0 degrees C and 70.0 degrees C. Inter-individual and intra-individual variability analysis was also computed using multiple samples and showed that by using the first derivative of reflectance the sources of variability are minimized. Furthermore, the first derivative shows variation in the shape mainly localized in the range [600-700] nm for the tissue subjected to 70.0 degrees C.

It improves the exploitation and understanding of in vivo/vitro experiments. This work focused on testing the capability of multispectral imaging to characterise the tissue damage produced by alkaline hypochlorite on the body and eggs of the biological model C. elegans. To that end, three synchronisation processes with different final bleach and sodium hydroxide concentrations were performed. The impact of treatments was characterised by measuring egg viability and morphology, besides capturing multispectral images of both nematode bodies and eggs. Multispectral images consisted of seven slices captured from different wavelengths within the visible/infrared spectrum by different light-pass filters. The results showed dependence between increased alkaline hypochlorite concentration and loss of egg viability/morphology. This relation was also observed for the imaging data, which showed alterations to tissue transmittance for all the tested wavelengths for both bodies and eggs. Localised alterations related to alkaline hypochlorite diffusion through anatomical nematode orifices were recognised. Applying multivariate methods to imaging data successfully characterised tissue alterations, from which treatment type was predicted for both nematodes and eggs. Moreover, the alterations recorded by imaging data were also used to predict egg viability regardless of treatment type (0.94). The high correlation between the imaging data from nematodes and eggs with egg viability evidenced multispectral imaging's ability to characterise tissue damage and its possible practical application to study alterations to the tissues of this biological model.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "Multispectral image alignment using a three channel endoscope in vivo during minimally invasive surgery", "abstract": "Sequential multispectral imaging is an acquisition technique that involves collecting images of a target at different wavelengths, to compile a spectrum for each pixel. In surgical applications it suffers from low illumination levels and motion artefacts. A three-channel rigid endoscope system has been developed that allows simultaneous recording of stereoscopic and multispectral images. Salient features on the tissue surface may be tracked during the acquisition in the stereo cameras and, using multiple camera triangulation techniques, this information used to align the multispectral images automatically even though the tissue or camera is moving. This paper describes a detailed validation of the set-up in a controlled experiment before presenting the first in vivo use of the device in a porcine minimally invasive surgical procedure. Multispectral images of the large bowel were acquired and used to extract the relative concentration of haemoglobin in the tissue despite motion due to breathing during the acquisition. Using the stereoscopic information it was also possible to overlay the multispectral information on the reconstructed 3D surface.

Sensitivity is limited, especially in the visible spectral range, by the presence of ubiquitous autofluorescence signals (mostly arising from the skin and gut), which need to be separated from those of targeted fluorophores. Fluorescence-based imaging is also affected by absorbing and scattering properties of tissue in both the visible and to a lesser extent the near-infrared (NIR) regions. However, the small size of typical animal models (usually mice) often permits the detection of enough light arising even from relatively deep locations to allow the capture of signals with an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio. Multispectral imaging, through its ability to separate autofluorescence from label fluorescence, can increase sensitivity as much as 300 times compared to conventional approaches, and concomitantly improve quantitative accuracy. In the NIR region, autofluorescence, while still significant, poses less of a problem. However, the task of disentangling signals from multiple fluorophores remains. Multispectral imaging allows the separation of five or more fluorophores, with each signal quantitated and visualized separately. Preclinical small animal imaging is often accompanied by microscopic analysis, both before and after the in vivo phase. This can involve tissue culture manipulations and/or histological examination of fixed or frozen tissue.

Examples of in vivo hyperspectral data in the SWIR spectral range (950-2500 nm) from human skin bruises and porcine skin burns are presented as examples. Data are processed using the minimum noise fraction transform (MNF), and K-means clustering. K-means clustering was found to perform significantly better if applied to MNF transformed data. The classification results agree well with biopsies, spectral data and visual inspection of injuries. It is thus shown that unsupervised clustering can be a preferable technique in cases where it is challenging to use or interpret results from physics based models, or where the ground truth is lacking or not well defined.

When Raman is utilized to image highly scattering cellular environments, integration times can be on the order of several minutes to hours. Recently developed compressed sensing techniques can greatly improve hyperspectral Raman acquisition times by randomly under-sampling the spatial dimensions. A digital micromirror device (DMD) is used to spatially encode the image plane. The encoded image is then propagated to a spectrometer where the spectral components are produced by shearing one spatial dimension. Several reconstruction algorithms have been developed that can then be used to return the original. Here, we will present single-shot, 2D Raman imaging of CHO cells using compressed hyperspectral Raman microscope. This system provides an order of magnitude improvement on traditional hyperspectral acquisition rates.

Currently, noninvasive methods (i.e. dermoscopy) have improved melanoma detection, but the definitive diagnosis is still achieved only by invasive method (istopathological observation of the excised lesion). The multispectral system we developed is capable of imaging layers of structures placed at increasing depth, thanks to the fact that light propagates into the skin and reaches different depths depending on its wavelength. This allows to image many features which are less or not visible in the clinical and dermoscopic examination. A new semeiotics is proposed to describe the content of multispectral images. Dermoscopic criteria can be easily applied to describe each image in the set, however inter-images correlations need new suitable descriptors. The first group of new parameters describes how the dermoscopic features, vary across the set of images. More aspects are then introduced.

The spectrum of light produced by the source that escapes the subject varies with the depth of the emission source because of the wavelength-dependence of the optical properties of tissue. Consequently, multispectral or hyperspectral data acquisition should help in the 3D localization of deep sources. In this paper, we describe a framework for fully 3D bioluminescence tomographic image acquisition and reconstruction that exploits spectral information. We describe regularized tomographic reconstruction techniques that use semi-infinite slab or FEM-based diffusion approximations of photon transport through turbid media. Singular value decomposition analysis was used for data dimensionality reduction and to illustrate the advantage of using hyperspectral rather than achromatic data. Simulation studies in an atlas-mouse geometry indicated that sub-millimeter resolution may be attainable given accurate knowledge of the optical properties of the animal. A fixed arrangement of mirrors and a single CCD camera were used for simultaneous acquisition of multispectral imaging data over most of the surface of the animal. Phantom studies conducted using this system demonstrated our ability to accurately localize deep point-like sources and show that a resolution of 1.5 to 2.2 mm for depths up to 6 mm can be achieved.

The development of denoising methods which prevent the need for signal averaging in time presents an important goal for advancing the dynamic capabilities of the technology. Methods: In this paper, a denoising method is developed for multispectral optoacoustic imaging which exploits the implicit sparsity of multispectral optoacoustic signals both in space and in spectrum. Noise suppression is achieved by applying thresholding on a combined wavelet-Karhunen-Loeve representation in which multispectral optoacoustic signals appear particularly sparse. The method is based on inherent characteristics of multispectral optoacoustic signals of tissues, offering promise for general application in different incarnations of multispectral optoacoustic systems. Results: The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on mouse images acquired in vivo for two common additive noise sources: time-varying parasitic signals and white noise. In both cases, the proposed method shows considerable improvement in image quality in comparison to previously published denoising strategies that do not consider multispectral information. Conclusions: The suggested denoising methodology can achieve noise suppression with minimal signal loss and considerably outperforms previously proposed denoising strategies, holding promise for advancing the dynamic capabilities of multispectral optoacoustic imaging while retaining image quality.

This non-invasive device collects contiguous hyperspectral images across the entire cervical portio. The high spatial and spectral resolution of the HSDI instruments make them uniquely well suited for addressing the-issues of coupled spatial and spectral variability of tissues in vivo. Analysis of HSDI data indicates that tissue spectra vary from point to point, even within histopathologically homogeneous regions. This spectral variability exhibits both random and patterned components, implying that point monitoring may be susceptible to significant sources of noise and clutter inherent in the tissue. We have analyzed HSDI images from clinical CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) patients to quantify the spatial variability of fluorescence and reflectance spectra.

This is because it provides solutions to some of the major challenges in fluorescence-based imaging, namely ameliorating the consequences of the presence of autofluorescence and the need to easily accommodate relatively high levels of signal multiplexing. MSI, which spectrally characterizes and computationally eliminates autofluorescence, enhances the signal-to-background dramatically, revealing otherwise obscured targets. While this article concentrates on examples derived from liquid-crystal tunable filter-based technology, the intent is to showcase the advantages of multispectral imaging in general. Some technologies used to generate multispectral images are compatible with only particular optical configurations, such as point-scanning laser confocal microscopy. Band-sequential approaches, such as those afforded by liquid-crystal tunable filters (LCTFs), can be conveniently coupled with a variety of imaging modalities, which, in addition to fluorescence microscopy, include brightfield (nonfluorescent) microscopy as well as small-animal, noninvasive in-vivo imaging. Brightfield microscopy is the chosen format for histopathology, which relies on immunohistochemistry to provide molecularly resolved clinical information. However, in contrast to fluorescent labels, multiple chromogens, if they spatially overlap, are much harder to separate and quantitate, unless MSI approaches are used. In-vivo imaging is a rapidly growing field with applications in basic biology, drug discovery, and clinical medicine.

In a second set of experiments, the temporal evolution of the MS tissue classes in response to therapeutic intervention Apo2L/TRAIL and CPT-11 was observed. The multiple parameters played complementary roles in identifying the various tissues. The ADC was the dominant parameter for identifying regions of necrosis, whereas T-2 identified two necrotic subpopulations, and M-o contributed to the differentiation of viable tumor from subcutaneous adipose tissue.

Autofluorescence within the eye is associated with several disorders, such as Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) which is a leading cause of central vision loss. Its pathogenesis is incompletely understood, but endogenous fluorophores in retinal tissue might play a role. Hyperspectral fluorescence microscopy of ex-vivo retinal tissue can be used to determine the fluorescence emission spectra of these fluorophores. Comparisons of spectra in healthy and diseased tissues can provide important insights into the pathogenesis of AMD. However, the spectrum from each pixel of the hyperspectral image is a superposition of spectra from multiple overlapping tissue components. As spectra cannot be negative, there is a need for a non-negative blind source separation model to isolate individual spectra. We propose a tensor formulation by leveraging multiple excitation wavelengths to excite the tissue sample. Arranging images from different excitation wavelengths as a tensor, a non-negative tensor decomposition can be performed to recover a provably unique low-rank model with factors representing emission and excitation spectra of these materials and corresponding abundance maps of autofluorescent substances in the tissue sample. We iteratively impute missing values common in fluorescence measurements using Expectation-Maximization and use L-2 regularization to reduce ill-posedness.

Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as a tissue classifier, we developed a method to use HSI to perform an optical biopsy of ex-vivo surgical specimens, collected from 21 patients undergoing surgical cancer resection. Training and testing on samples from different patients, the CNN can distinguish squamous cell carcinoma (SCCa) from normal aerodigestive tract tissues with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.82, 81% accuracy, 81% sensitivity, and 80% specificity. Additionally, normal oral tissues can be sub-classified into epithelium, muscle, and glandular mucosa using a decision tree method, with an average AUC of 0.94, 90% accuracy, 93% sensitivity, and 89% specificity. After separately training on thyroid tissue, the CNN differentiates between thyroid carcinoma and normal thyroid with an AUC of 0.95, 92% accuracy, 92% sensitivity, and 92% specificity. Moreover, the CNN can discriminate medullary thyroid carcinoma from benign multi-nodular goiter (MNG) with an AUC of 0.93, 87% accuracy, 88% sensitivity, and 85% specificity. Classical-type papillary thyroid carcinoma is differentiated from benign MNG with an AUC of 0.91, 86% accuracy, 86% sensitivity, and 86% specificity. Our preliminary results demonstrate that an HSI-based optical biopsy method using CNNs can provide multi-category diagnostic information for normal head-and-neck tissue, SCCa, and thyroid carcinomas.

Yet, today there are limited means by which the boundaries of such scars can be visualized during surgery and distinguished from the sites of acute injury caused by radiofrequency (RF) ablation. OBJECTIVE We sought to explore a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) methodology to delineate and distinguish scar tissue from tissue injury caused by RF ablation. METHODS RF ablation of the ventricular surface of live rats that underwent thoracotomy was followed by a 2-month animal recovery period. During a second surgery, new RF lesions were placed next to the scarred tissue from the previous ablation procedure. The myocardial infarction model was used as an alternative way to create scar tissue. RESULTS Excitation-emission matrices acquired from the sites of RF lesions, scar region, and the surrounding unablated tissue re-vealed multiple spectral changes. These findings justified HSI of the heart surface using illumination with 365 nm UV light while acquiring spectral images within the visible range. Autofluorescence-based HSI enabled to distinguish sites of RF lesions from scar or unablated myocardium in open-chest rats. A pilot version of a percutaneous HSI catheter was used to demonstrate the feasibility of RF lesion visualization in atrial tissue of live pigs.

This method effectively reduced the image artifacts caused by nonuniform illumination and background absorption. Furthermore, with second derivative analysis, only three specific wavelengths (620, 696, and 772 nm) are needed for tissue classification with optimal separability. Clinical feasibility of the proposed image analysis and classification method was tested in a clinical trial where cervical hyperspectral images from three patients were used for classification analysis. Our proposed method successfully classified the cervix tissue into three categories of normal, inflammation and high-grade lesion. These classification results were coincident with those by an experienced gynecology oncologist after applying acetic acid.

In colorectal surgery, detecting ureters and mesenteric arteries is of utmost importance to prevent iatrogenic injury and to facilitate intraoperative decision making. A tool enabling ureter- and artery-specific image enhancement within (and possibly through) surrounding adipose tissue would facilitate this need, especially during laparoscopy. To evaluate the potential of hyperspectral imaging in colorectal surgery, we explored spectral tissue signatures using single-spot diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). As hyperspectral cameras with silicon (Si) and indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) sensor chips are becoming available, we investigated spectral distinctive features for both sensor ranges. Methods. In vivo wide-band (wavelength range 350-1830 nm) DRS was performed during open colorectal surgery. From the recorded spectra, 36 features were extracted at predefined wavelengths: 18 gradients and 18 amplitude differences. For classification of respectively ureter and artery in relation to surrounding adipose tissue, the best distinctive feature was selected using binary logistic regression for Si- and InGaAs-sensor spectral ranges separately. Classification performance was evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation. Results. In 10 consecutive patients, 253 spectra were recorded on 53 tissue sites (including colon, adipose tissue, muscle, artery, vein, ureter). Classification of ureter versus adipose tissue revealed accuracy of 100% for both Si range and InGaAs range. Classification of artery versus surrounding adipose tissue revealed accuracies of 95% (Si) and 89% (InGaAs). Conclusions. Intraoperative DRS showed that Si and InGaAs sensors are equally suited for automated classification of ureter versus surrounding adipose tissue. Si sensors seem better suited for classifying artery versus mesenteric adipose tissue.

Using spectral unmixing analysis of the data collected, MSOT can then differentiate the spectral signatures of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin and of photo-absorbing agents and quantify their concentration. By being able to detect absorbing molecules up to centimeters deep in the tissue it represents an ideal modality for small animal brain imaging, simultaneously providing anatomical, hemodynamic, functional, and molecular information.

This last aspect implies unnecessary occupation of cost-intensive operating room staff as well as longer anesthesia for the patient.

In vivo applications of MSI for deep seated fluorophores require consideration of diffusive light propagation in biological tissue. We have previously shown that a well-known redshift of fluorescence spectra in diffusive medium induces a fluorophore cross-talk, which cannot be accounted for even with known optical properties of the medium. In contrast, FLT measurements remain largely unaffected by light propagation in tissue, enabling zero cross-talk and accurate relative quantification. While a fully quantitative estimation of fluorophore concentrations requires depth resolved tomographic imaging, this is often not possible due to the difficulty of estimating tissue optical properties and modelling light propagation in complex tissue geometries. Here, we experimentally investigate the performance of planar (non-tomographic) MSI and FLT multiplexing for the quantitative recovery of multiple near-infrared fluorophores embedded in 4-8 mm thick tissue. We show that FLT multiplexing provides a superior quantification accuracy (error < 10%) compared to MSI (error = 20-107%) in tissue. The error rates for MSI increased with tissue thickness and can be directly attributed to the spectral redshift induced cross-talk between emission spectra.

In this analysis, the concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin and that of deoxygenated hemoglobin were estimated as the absorption parameters, whereas the coefficient a and the exponent b of the reduced scattering coefficient spectrum approximated by a power law function were estimated as the scattering parameters. The spectra of absorption and reduced scattering coefficients were reconstructed from the absorption and scattering parameters, and the spectral images of absorption and reduced scattering coefficients were then estimated. In order to confirm the feasibility of this method, we performed in vivo experiments on exposed rat brain. The estimated images of the absorption coefficients were dominated by the spectral characteristics of hemoglobin. The estimated spectral images of the reduced scattering coefficients had a broad scattering spectrum, exhibiting a larger magnitude at shorter wavelengths, corresponding to the typical spectrum of brain tissue published in the literature.

We used microspectrofluorometry and a Multispectral Imaging Autofluorescence Microscopy (MIAM) technique to analyze lymph-node biopsies from patients with lymphoadenopathy of different origins. Images of tissue autofluorescence were obtained by excitation at 365 nm of lymph-node sections and sequential detection with interference filters (50 mm bandwidth) peaked at 450, 550 and 658 mm. Monochrome images were combined together in a single red-green-blue color image. Most of the fluorescence was observed within the blue spectral band because of large contributions from extracellular collagen and elastin fibers as well as from reduced form of intracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate). Autofluorescence imaging shows morphological differences between neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissues. The reactive hyperplasia samples show the typical lymph-node organization with weak fluorescent follicles separated by high fluorescent connective trabeculae. In the neoplastic lymph nodes the loss of follicle organization is observed. Consequently, IMAM permits to discriminate between non-neoplastic and neoplastic tissues on the basis of their autofluorescence pattern. Multispectral imaging of tissue autofluorescence may present some advantages with respect to standard histochemical microscopy since it (1) does not require any chemical manipulation of samples; (2) gives real-time results performing the analysis immediately upon specimen resection; and (3) supplies a representation of the biological structure organization linked to endogenous fluorophores.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "Visible, hyperspectral imaging evaluating the cutaneous response to ultraviolet radiation", "abstract": "In vivo diagnostics of skin diseases as well as understanding of the skin biology constitute a field demanding characterization of physiological and anatomical parameters.

It can provide quantitative information relating to global tissue properties associated with structural, metabolic, immunological, and genetic biochemical phenomena in terms of molecular species including amino acids, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acid (DNA). To date in vivo Raman spectroscopy systems mostly included probes and biopsy needles typically limited to single-point tissue interrogation over a scale between 100 and 500 microns. The development of wider field handheld systems could improve tumor localization for a range of open surgery applications including brain, ovarian, and skin cancers. Methods: Here we present a novel Raman spectroscopy implementation using a coherent imaging bundle of fibers to create a probe capable of reconstructing molecular images over mesoscopic fields of view. Detection is performed using linear scanning with a rotation mirror and an imaging spectrometer. Different slits widths were tested at the entrance of the spectrometer to optimize spatial and spectral resolution while preserving sufficient signal-to-noise ratios to detect the principal Raman tissue features. The nonbiological samples, calcite and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), were used to characterize the performance of the system. The new wide-field probe was tested on ex vivo samples of calf brain and swine tissue. Raman spectral content of both tissue types were validated with data from the literature and compared with data acquired with a single-point Raman spectroscopy probe. The single-point probe was used as the gold standard against which the new instrument was benchmarked as it has already been thoroughly validated for biological tissue characterization. Result: We have developed and characterized a practical noncontact handheld Raman imager providing tissue information at a spatial resolution of 115 microns over a field of view >14 mm(2) and a spectral resolution of 6 cm(-1) over the whole fingerprint region. Typical integration time to acquire an entire Raman image over swine tissue was set to approximately 100 s. Spectra acquired with both probes (single-point and wide-field) showed good agreement, with a Pearson correlation factor >0.85 over different tissue categories. Protein and lipid content of imaged tissue were manifested into the measured spectra which correlated well with previous findings in the literature. An example of quantitative molecular map is presented for swine tissue and calf brain based on the ratio of protein-to-lipid content showing clear delineations between white and gray matter as well as between adipose and muscle tissue. Conclusion: We presented the development of a Raman imaging probe with a field of view of a few millimeters and a spatial resolution consistent with standard surgical imaging methods using an imaging bundle. Spectra acquired with the newly developed system on swine tissue and calf brain correlated well with an establish single-point probe and observed spectral features agreed with previous finding in the literature.

These studies demonstrate that nanoparticle surface modification with the cell penetrating peptide TAT facilitates brain-specific delivery that is restricted to brain vasculature. Although nanoparticle entry into the healthy brain parenchyma is minimal, with no evidence for movement of nanoparticles across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), we observed that nanoparticles are able to enter to the central nervous system (CNS) through regions of altered BBB permeability - for example, into circumventricular organs in the brain or leaky vasculature of late-stage intracranial tumors. In sum, these data demonstrate a new, multispectral approach for barcoding PLGA, which enables simultaneous, quantitative analysis of the fate of multiple nanoparticle formulations in vivo.

There is currently no tool capable of providing real-time, accurate, and continuous margin-assessment guidance during oral cancer resection surgery. Multispectral autofluorescence lifetime imaging (maFLIM) is a label-free imaging modality that enables quantifying a plurality of metabolic and compositional autofluorescence biomarkers of oral dysplasia and cancer. We have developed and validated a machine-learning assisted computer aided detection (CAD) system for automated discrimination of dysplastic and cancerous from healthy oral tissue based on in vivo widefield maFLIM endoscopy data. This CAD system can be potentially embedded into maFLIM endoscopes to enable continuous in situ detection of positive margins during oral cancer resection surgery, thus facilitating maximal tumor resection and improving surgical outcomes for oral cancer patients. Multispectral autofluorescence lifetime imaging (maFLIM) can be used to clinically image a plurality of metabolic and biochemical autofluorescence biomarkers of oral epithelial dysplasia and cancer. This study tested the hypothesis that maFLIM-derived autofluorescence biomarkers can be used in machine-learning (ML) models to discriminate dysplastic and cancerous from healthy oral tissue. Clinical widefield maFLIM endoscopy imaging of cancerous and dysplastic oral lesions was performed at two clinical centers. Endoscopic maFLIM images from 34 patients acquired at one of the clinical centers were used to optimize ML models for automated discrimination of dysplastic and cancerous from healthy oral tissue. A computer-aided detection system was developed and applied to a set of endoscopic maFLIM images from 23 patients acquired at the other clinical center, and its performance was quantified in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). Discrimination of dysplastic and cancerous from healthy oral tissue was achieved with an ROC-AUC of 0.81. This study demonstrates the capabilities of widefield maFLIM endoscopy to clinically image autofluorescence biomarkers that can be used in ML models to discriminate dysplastic and cancerous from healthy oral tissue.

Ten porcine lungs were randomly divided into control and donation after circulatory death (DCD) groups (n = 5, each). Lungs were perfused in cellular EVLP for 2 h, and multispectral images were continuously collected from the dorsal sides of the lower lobes. We examined whether lower lobe SaO(2) correlated with PaO2/FiO(2) (P/F) ratios in lower pulmonary veins (PV).

Using a cross-validation paradigm with data from different patients, the CNN can distinguish SCCa from normal aerodigestive tract tissues with an area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 0.82. Additionally, normal tissue from the upper aerodigestive tract can be subclassified into squamous epithelium, muscle, and gland with an average AUC of 0.94. After separately training on thyroid tissue, the CNN can differentiate between thyroid carcinoma and normal thyroid with an AUC of 0.95, 92% accuracy, 92% sensitivity, and 92% specificity. Moreover, the CNN can discriminate medullary thyroid carcinoma from benign multinodular goiter (MNG) with an AUC of 0.93.

Mosaicing may offer a means to perform rapid histology at the bedside. A possible barrier toward clinical acceptance is that the mosaics are based on a single mode of grayscale contrast and appear black and white, whereas histology is based on two stains (hematoxylin for nuclei, eosin for cellular cytoplasm and dermis) and appears purple and pink. Toward addressing this barrier, we report advances in digital staining: fluorescence mosaics that show only nuclei, are digitally stained purple and overlaid on reflectance mosaics, which show only cellular cytoplasm and dermis, and are digitally stained pink. With digital staining, the appearance of confocal mosaics mimics the appearance of histology. Using multispectral analysis and color matching functions, red, green, and blue (RGB) components of hematoxylin and eosin stains in tissue were determined. The resulting RGB components were then applied in a linear algorithm to transform fluorescence and reflectance contrast in confocal mosaics to the absorbance contrast seen in pathology. Optimization of staining with acridine orange showed improved quality of digitally stained mosaics, with good correlation to the corresponding histology.

So far it has never been applied to the Olfactory Bulb (OB), although this structure is particularly well suited to the optical study of brain activation due to the its well defined organization, the ability to physiologically activate it with odorants, and the low depth of the activated layers. To obtain hemodynamics parameters from reflectance variations data, it is necessary to take into account a corrective factor called Differential Pathlength (DP). It is routinely estimated using Monte Carlo simulations, modeling photons propagation in simplified infinite geometry tissue models.

Multispectral fluorescence microscopy (MFL) is a novel imaging technique that allows the overlapping of a fluorescent image and a white light image in real-time, with delivery of the merged image to the surgeon through the eyepieces of a surgical microscope. MFL permits the detection and characterization of brain tumors using fluorescent molecular markers such as 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) or indocyanine green (ICG), while simultaneously obtaining high definition white light images to create a pseudo-colored composite image in real-time. Limitations associated with the use of MFL include decreased light imaging intensity and decreased levels of magnification that may compromise maximal tumor resection on a cellular scale. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is another novel advanced imaging technique that is based on miniaturization of the microscope imaging head in order to provide the possibility of in vivo microscopy at the cellular level. Clear visualization of the cellular cytoarchitecture can be achieved with 400-fold-1,000-fold magnification. CLE allows on the one hand the intra-operative detection and differentiation of single tumor cells (without the need for intra-operative histologic analysis of biopsy specimens) as well as the definition of borders between tumor and normal tissue at a cellular level, dramatically improving the accuracy of surgical resection. The application and implementation of CLE-assisted surgery in surgical oncology increases not only the number of options for real-time diagnostic imaging, but also the therapeutic options by extending the resection borders of cancer at a cellular level and, more importantly, by protecting the functionality of normal tissue in the adjacent areas of the human brain.

The diffuse infiltration into the surrounding normal brain by these tumors makes their accurate identification by the naked eye difficult. Since surgery is the common treatment for brain cancer, an accurate radical resection of the tumor leads to improved survival rates for patients. However, the identification of the tumor boundaries during surgery is challenging. Hyperspectral imaging is a noncontact, non-ionizing and non-invasive technique suitable for medical diagnosis. This study presents the development of a novel classification method taking into account the spatial and spectral characteristics of the hyperspectral images to help neurosurgeons to accurately determine the tumor boundaries in surgical-time during the resection, avoiding excessive excision of normal tissue or unintentionally leaving residual tumor. The algorithm proposed in this study to approach an efficient solution consists of a hybrid framework that combines both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. Firstly, a supervised pixel-wise classification using a Support Vector Machine classifier is performed. The generated classification map is spatially homogenized using a one-band representation of the HS cube, employing the Fixed Reference t-Stochastic Neighbors Embedding dimensional reduction algorithm, and performing a K-Nearest Neighbors filtering. The information generated by the supervised stage is combined with a segmentation map obtained via unsupervised clustering employing a Hierarchical K-Means algorithm. The fusion is performed using a majority voting approach that associates each cluster with a certain class. To evaluate the proposed approach, five hyperspectral images of surface of the brain affected by glioblastoma tumor in vivo from five different patients have been used. The final classification maps obtained have been analyzed and validated by specialists.

Methods Six melanoma patients were examined in vivo using the 3D multispectral photoacoustic imaging system. For five cases of melanomas (one in situ, three nodular, and one acral lentiginous type melanoma), the spectrally unmixed photoacoustic depths were calculated and compared against histopathological depths. Results Spectrally unmixed photoacoustic depths and histopathological depths match well within a mean absolute error of 0.36 mm. In particular, the measured minimum and maximum depths in the in situ and nodular type of melanoma were 0.6 and 9.1 mm, respectively. In the 3D photoacoustic image of one metastatic melanoma, feeding vessels were visualized in the melanoma, suggesting the neovascularization around the tumour.

This paper describes an image reconstruction method called multi spectral diffuse Cerenkov luminescence tomography (msCLT) in order to obtain 3D images from the detection of CR. The multispectral approach is based on a set of 2D planar images acquired using a number of narrow bandpass filters, and the distinctive information content at each wavelength is used in the 3D image reconstruction process. The proposed msCLT method was tested both in vitro and in vivo using P-32-ATP and all the images were acquired by using the IVIS 200 small animal optical imager (Caliper Life Sciences, Alameda USA). Source depth estimation and spatial resolution measurements were performed using a small capillary source placed between several slices of chicken breast. The theoretical Cerenkov emission spectrum and optical properties of chicken breast were used in the modelling of photon propagation. In vivo imaging was performed by injecting control nude mice with 10 MBq of P-32-ATP and the 3D tracer bio-distribution was reconstructed. Whole body MRI was acquired to provide an anatomical localization of the Cerenkov emission. The spatial resolution obtained from the msCLT reconstructed images of the capillary source showed that the FWHM is about 1.5 mm for a 6 mm depth. Co-registered MRI images showed that the Cerenkov emission regions matches fairly well with anatomical regions, such as the brain, heart and abdomen. Ex vivo imaging of the different organs such as intestine, brain, heart and ribs further confirms these findings. We conclude that in vivo 3D bio-distribution of a pure beta-minus emitting radiopharmaceutical such as P-32-ATP can be obtained using the msCLT reconstruction approach.

The system's novelty resides in its method of illuminating tissue with precisely predetermined continuous complex spectra. The Texas Instruments digital micromirror device, DMD, chip consisting of 768 by 1024 mirrors, each 16 mu m square, can be switched between two positions at 12.5 kHz. Switching the appropriate mirrors controls the intensity of light illuminating the tissue as a function of wavelength, active spectral illumination. Meaning, the tissue can be illuminated with a different spectrum of light within 80 mu s. Precisely, predetermined spectral illumination penetrates into patient tissue, its chemical composition augments the spectral properties of the light, and its reflected spectra are detected and digitized at each pixel detector of a silicon charge-coupled device, CCD. Using complex spectral illumination, digital signal processing and chemometric methods produce chemically relevant images at near video rates. Specific to this work, tissue is illuminated spectrally with light spanning the visible electromagnetic spectrum (380 to 780 nm).

Three samples of colorectal carcinomas treated by radiochemotherapy together with one untreated sample are analyzed ex vivo before fixation in formalin by using a multispectral Mueller polarimetric imaging system operated from 500 to 700 nm. The Mueller images, analyzed using the Lu-Chipmann decomposition, show negligible diattenuation and retardation. The nonirradiated rectum exhibits a variation of depolarization with cancer evolution stage. At all wavelengths on irradiated samples, the contrast between the footprint of the initial tumor and surrounding healthy tissue is found to be much smaller for complete tumor regression than when a residual tumor is present, even at volume fractions of the order of 5%. This high sensitivity is attributed to the modification of stromal collagen induced by the cancer. The depolarization contrast between treated cancer and healthy tissue is found to increase monotonously with the volume fraction of residual cancer in the red part of the spectrum. Polarimetric imaging is a promising technique for detecting short-time small residual cancers, which is valuable information for pathological diagnosis and patient management by clinicians.

To address this issue, we have developed a novel, open-source software package to control high-speed, multispectral optical imaging systems. The software integrates a number of modular functions through a custom graphical user interface (GUI) and provides extensive control over a wide range of inexpensive IEEE 1394 Firewire cameras. Multispectral illumination can be incorporated through the use of off-the-shelf light emitting diodes which the software synchronizes to image acquisition via a programmed microcontroller, allowing arbitrary high-speed illumination sequences.

Recurrence rates after surgery can be as high as 55%, if residual cancer is present. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is evaluated for detection of SCC in ex-vivo surgical specimens. Several machine learning methods are investigated, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a spectral-spatial classification framework based on support vector machines. Quantitative results demonstrate that additional data preprocessing and unsupervised segmentation can improve CNN results to achieve optimal performance. The methods are trained in two paradigms, with and without specular glare. Classifying regions that include specular glare degrade the overall results, but the combination of the CNN probability maps and unsupervised segmentation using a majority voting method produces an area under the curve value of 0.81 [0.80, 0.83]. As the wavelengths of light used in HSI can penetrate different depths into biological tissue, cancer margins may change with depth and create uncertainty in the ground truth. Through serial histological sectioning, the variance in the cancer margin with depth is investigated and paired with qualitative classification heat maps using the methods proposed for the testing group of SCC patients. The results determined that the validity of the top section alone as the ground truth may be limited to 1 to 2 mm. The study of specular glare and margin variation provided better understanding of the potential of HSI for the use in the operating room.

This paper presents a full end-to-end analysis of a low-cost reflectance-mode multispectral imaging system operating in the visible and near-infrared spectra. The system consists of 13 LEDs mounted on a printed circuit board, a monochrome machine vision camera, and a tablet computer to control the hardware. The bill of materials for the system is less than $1000. Hardware design and implementation are detailed. Calibration, image capture, and preprocessing are also discussed. In validation experiments, excellent agreement is observed in diffuse reflectance measurements between the spectral camera setup and a spectrometer. To demonstrate that such spectral image data can yield meaningful optical measurements in vivo, the forearms of eight volunteers are imaged in the system. Their data are then analyzed to estimate the tissue optical properties of different skin layers using a Monte Carlo lookup table. In three volunteers, spectral images are captured before and after inducing erythema using a warm wet towel. Across the three subjects, a clear increase in the blood content of the superficial plexus layer was observed as a result of the erythema. Collectively, these findings suggest that a low-cost system can capture accurate spectral data and that clinically meaningful information can be derived from it. (C) The Authors.

Therefore, the near-infrared spectrum of each component was collected from the sliced section of the human carotid plaque obtained with endarterectomy and the optical characteristics were confirmed in several wavelengths. Based on this information, we assessed the diagnostic accuracy for ex vivo chemo-gram in each plaque component created with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), using multiple wavelengths. The chemogram projected on the actual image of plaque was created based on light intensity and transmittance change at three wavelengths. The wavelengths that were mainly were 1440, 1620, 1730, and 1930 nm. We evaluated the accuracy of histological diagnosis in chemogram compared with pathological findings, analyzing interobserver agreement with kappa-statistics. The chemograms that we created depicted the components of fibrous tissue, smooth muscle, lipid tissue, intraplaque hemorrhage, and calcification. Diagnostic odds ratio in each component was as follows: 259.6 in fibrous tissue, 144 in smooth muscle, 1123.5 in lipid tissue, 29.3 in intraplaque hemorrhage, and 136.3 in calcification. The k-statistics revealed that four components, excluding intraplaque hemorrhage, had substantial or almost perfect agreement. Thus, this study demonstrated the feasibility of using chemogram focused on specific component during the histological assessment of atherosclerotic plaques, highlighting its potential diagnostic ability.

Bilateral groin flaps were raised on 20 Sprague-Dawley rats. The femoral artery was transected on the trial side and re-anastomosed. Flaps and anastomoses were assessed before, during, and after the period of ischemia every ten minutes for overall 60 min using HSI and MDS. The contralateral sides' flaps served as controls. Tissue-oxygenation saturation (StO(2)), near-infrared perfusion index (NPI), hemoglobin (THI), and water distribution (TWI) were assessed by HSI, while blood flow was assessed by MDS. HSI correlates with the MDS signal in the case of sufficient and completely interrupted perfusion. HSI was able to validly and reproducibly detect tissue perfusion status using StO(2) and NPI. After 40 min, flap perfusion decreased due to the general aggravation of hemodynamic circulatory situation, which resulted in a significant drop of StO(2) (p < 0.005) and NPI (p < 0.005), whereas the Doppler signal remained unchanged.

Energy-based approaches have been investigated as potential alternative to the gold-standard techniques (e.g., Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection). Among these techniques, the laser has been studied for achieving a selective ablation of the gastric mucosa. Together with the optimization of the laser settings for avoiding tissue perforation or insufficient ablation, a tool providing quantitative information about the intraoperative tissue state can support the treatment guidance. This work aims at providing a novel non-invasive approach based on the use of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for monitoring ablative therapy in in vivo gastric mucosa. The three-dimensional datasets generated by the HSI provide spatial and spectral information of the scene, thus collecting tissue optical features during the ablation therapy in each pixel of the images. The operation of a diode laser focused on the porcine gastric mucosa was controlled in accordance with chosen temperature thresholds (i.e., 36, 60, 70, 80, 100, 110 degrees C), measured with a thermographic camera. HSIs of the living gastric mucosa undergoing laser procedure hold diagnostic information about the thermal outcome. Two tests have been performed, and the temperature dependence of three characteristic spectral wavelengths have been analysed: oxyhemoglobin (Hb0(2)) in the visible range 500-600 nm, methemoglobin (metHb) around 630 nm, and deoxyhemoglobin (Hb) at 760 nm. The data have been processed in terms of absorbance at the set temperature relative to the absorbance at initial body temperature (36 degrees C). After 60 degrees C the percentage relative absorbance of metHb increased significantly in both tests (i.e., 92.3 +/- 1.9 % at 70 degrees C and 229.4 +/- 4.7% at 100 degrees C in Test2); regarding the Hb at 110 degrees C, Test1 reported an increase of 43.8 +/- 1.7 %, versus 127.2 +/- 3.8% in the Test2. On the other hand, HbO(2) chromophore experiences an increase only for the first stages of heating later decreasing in favour of metHb and Hb formation.

While spectral unmixing methods are well established in fluorescence microscopy, they typically rely on precharacterized in-vitro spectra for each fluorophore. However, there are unique challenges for in-vivo applications, since the tissue absorption and scattering can have a significant impact on the measured spectrum of the fluorophore, and therefore make the in-vivo spectra substantially different to that of in vitro. In this work, we introduce a spectral unmixing algorithm tailored for in-vivo optical imaging that does not rely on precharacterized spectral libraries. It is derived from a multivariate curve resolution (MCR) method, which has been widely used in studies of chemometrics and gene expression. Given multispectral images and a few straightforward constraints such as non-negativity, the algorithm automatically finds the signal distribution and the pure spectrum of each component. Signal distribution maps help separate autofluorescence from other probes in the raw images and hence provide better quantification and localization for each probe. The algorithm is demonstrated with an extensive set of in-vivo experiments using near-infrared dyes and quantum dots in both epi-illumination and transillumination geometries.

Additionally, some wavelengths can contain noise and removing such bands can improve the classification stage.

Methods: Evaluation of tissue oxygenation during ischemia and upon reperfusion was performed in left hind limb in a rat model (n = 20). Ischemia was induced by clamping and dissection of the superficial femoral artery. Reperfusion of the limb was achieved by microsurgical anastomosis of the dissected artery. Oxygenation parameters of the hind limb were assessed via TIVITA (TM) before and immediately after clamping and dissection of the artery, 3 and 30 min after reperfusion as well as on postoperative days 1 and 2.

Results: In 12 from 20 cases, TIVITA (TM) recorded a sufficient reperfusion with oxygenation parameters comparable to baseline or control condition. However, in 8 from 20 cases oxygenation was found impaired after re perfusion causing a re-assessment of the microvascular anastomosis. Thereby, technical problems like stenosis or local thrombosis were found in all cases and were surgically treated leading to an increased tissue oxygenation.

In this work, we propose an alternative pseudo multispectral classification (PMC) technique using CIE LAB spaces instead of gray scale T1-weighted MPRAGE images, combined with a new preprocessing technique for contrast enhancement and an optimized iterative K-means clustering. To improve the accuracy of the classification process, gray scale images were converted to multispectral CIE LAB data by applying several transformation matrices. Thus, the amount of information associated with each image voxel was increased. The image contrast was then enhanced by applying a real time function that separates brain tissue distributions and improve image contrast in certain brain regions. The data were then classified using an optimized iterative and convergent K-means classifier. The performance of the proposed approach was assessed using simulation and in vivo human studies through comparison with three common software packages used for brain MR image segmentation, namely FSL, SPM8 and K-means clustering. In the presence of high SNR, the results showed that the four algorithms achieve a good classification. Conversely, in the presence of low SNR, PMC was shown to outperform the other methods by accurately recovering all tissue volumes. The quantitative assessment of brain tissue classification for simulated studies showed that the PMC algorithm resulted in a mean Jaccard index (JI) of 0.74 compared to 0.75 for FSL, 0.7 for SPM and 0.8 for K-means. The in vivo human studies showed that the PMC algorithm resulted in a mean JI of 0.92, which reflects a good spatial overlap between segmented and actual volumes, compared to 0.84 for FSL, 0.78 for SPM and 0.66 for K-means.

Among vertebrates, zebrafish is uniquely suited for in vivo imaging owing to its small size and optical translucency. However, distinguishing and following cells over extended time periods remains difficult. Previous studies have demonstrated that Cre recombinase-mediated recombination can lead to combinatorial expression of spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins (RFP, YFP and CFP) in neighboring cells, creating a 'Brainbow' of colors. The random combination of fluorescent proteins provides a way to distinguish adjacent cells, visualize cellular interactions and perform lineage analyses. Here, we describe Zebrabow (Zebrafish Brainbow) tools for in vivo multicolor imaging in zebrafish. First, we show that the broadly expressed ubi: Zebrabow line provides diverse color profiles that can be optimized by modulating Cre activity. Second, we find that colors are inherited equally among daughter cells and remain stable throughout embryonic and larval stages. Third, we show that UAS: Zebrabow lines can be used in combination with Gal4 to generate broad or tissue-specific expression patterns and facilitate tracing of axonal processes. Fourth, we demonstrate that Zebrabow can be used for long-term lineage analysis. Using the cornea as a model system, we provide evidence that embryonic corneal epithelial clones are replaced by large, wedge-shaped clones formed by centripetal expansion of cells from the peripheral cornea.

The present study shows epidermal thickening and decrease in oxyhemoglobin concentration can also be detected prior to ulceration at pre-ulcerative sites.

Sixty optical signatures or indices as a function of the associated reflectance (R-lambda) at the special wavelength (lambda) urn which proposed in the literatures were used to predict the total chlorophyll content in cucumber leaves. Finally, R-710/R-760 (R-780 - R-710)/(R-780 - R-680), (R-750 - R-705)/(R-750 + R-705), (R-680 - R-430)/(R-680 + R-430), R-860/(R-555 x R-708), (R695-705)(-1) - (R750-800)(-1). and REP-LEM (a index based on red edge position and estimated with h a linear extrapolation method) were identified as optimum indices. Red-edge waveband (680-780 nm) appeared in all these optimum indices, indicating the importance of REP (red edge position) in chlorophyll estimation. When (R695-705)(-1) - (R750-800)(-1), the best index was applied to an independent validation set, chlorophyll content (r = 0.8286) were reasonably well predicted, indicating model robustness.

However, the clinical presentation is often complex and the evaluation subjective. Multispectral image analysis of melanomas allows selection of features related to the content and distribution of absorbers, mainly melanin and hemoglobin, present within the lesion. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the same features might be useful to predict melanoma thickness. Methods: A multispectral image system was used to analyze in vivo 1939 pigmented skin lesions. The lesion selection was based on clinical and/or dermoscopic features that supported a suspicion for melanoma. All the lesions were then subjected to surgery for the histopathological diagnosis, and 250 were melanomas. From the multispectral images of the melanomas, we selected 12 features, seven of which were used to train and test an artificial neural network on 155 and 95 melanomas, respectively. Results: Sensitivity (i.e., melanoma >= 0.75 mm thick correctly classified) and specificity (i.e., melanoma < 0.75 mm thick correctly classified) evaluated from the receiving operating characteristic curves ranged from 76 to 90% and from 91 to 74%, respectively. Conclusions: Our approach provides results similar to those obtained with other methods and has the advantage that it is not related to the expertise of the clinician.

A complete set of polarization parameters was derived. The combination of linear depolarization and linear retardance yields the highest accuracy in sample classification. When the depolarization of linearly polarized light due to scattering is independent of the orientation angle of the incident linear polarization vector, the derivation of linear polarization properties will require only 3 x 3 Mueller matrix, which would significantly reduce the complexity of the polarimetry imaging system. When additional parameters are needed to complement the two linear polarization parameters, retardance, circular depolarization, and depolarization can be included in classification in the order of preference. However, these additional parameters would require the measurement of 4 x 4 Mueller matrix.

The SWIR HSI technique reported here is developed to multiplex two types of nanoprobes: polymeric nanoparticles doped with organic dye (PNPs) and rare-earth doped fluoride nanoparticles (RENPs). Both types of nanoprobes exhibit PL in the same spectral range (similar to 900-1200 nm), which hinders spectral separation of PL with optical filters and limits possibilities for their multiplexed imaging in biological tissues.

Moreover, combining several imaging modalities can provide multifaceted, complementary and cross-validated information. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a promising imaging modality that can reflect blood vasculature and tissue oxygenation as well as detect exogenous molecules, but one shortcoming of PAI is a lack of organic photoacoustic contrast agents capable of providing tumor contrast. Methods: In the present study, we designed an animal model of liver metastases from colon cancer and monitored metastasis development by in vivo bioluminescence and X-ray microcomputed tomography. Contrast-agent-free PAI was used to detect the respective amounts of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin and, thus, liver tissue oxygenation. two contrast agents, Angiostamp800 and indocyanin green (ICG), respectively with and without tumor targeting specificity, were then evaluated for their dual fluorescence and photoacoustic detectability and were then used for combined PAI and fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (fDOT) at various disease development stages. Findings: Contrast-agent-free PAI reflected tumor angiogenesis and gradual hypoxia during metastasis development. Multispectral PAI enabled noninvasive real-time monitoring of ICG blood pharmacokinetics, which demonstrated tumor-related liver dysfunction. Both PAI and fluorescence ICG signals were clearly modified in metastasis-bearing livers but did not allow for differentiation between different disease stages. In contrast, there was a significant improvement achieved by using the tumor-specific marker Angiostamp800, which provided gradually increasing PAI and fDOT signals during metastasis development.

Traditional measures of perfusion assessment rely on clinical judgement and are mainly subjective, based on tissue appearance, leading to variability between clinicians. This paper describes a multispectral imaging (MSI) laparoscope that can derive quantitative measures of tissue oxygen saturation (SO2). The system uses a xenon surgical light source and fast filter wheel camera to capture eight narrow waveband images across the visible range in approximately 0.3 s. Spectral validation measurements were performed by imaging standardised colour tiles and comparing reflectance with ground truth spectrometer data. Tissue spectra were decomposed into individual contributions from haemoglobin, adipose tissue and scattering, using a previously-developed regression approach. Initial clinical results from seven patients undergoing colorectal surgery are presented and used to characterise measurement stability and reproducibility in vivo. Strategies to improve signal-to-noise ratio and correct for motion are described. Images of healthy bowel tissue (in vivo) indicate that baseline SO2 is approximately 75 t 6%. The SO2 profile along a bowel segment following ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) shows a decrease from the proximal to distal end. In the clinical cases shown, imaging results concurred with clinical judgements of the location of well-perfused tissue. Adipose tissue, visibly yellow in the RGB images, is shown to surround the mesentery and cover some of the serosa. SO2 in this tissue is consistently high, with mean value of 90%. These results show that MSI is a potential intraoperative guidance tool for assessment of perfusion. Mapping of SO2 in the colon could be used by surgeons to guide choice of transection points and ensure that well-perfused tissue is used to form an anastomosis. The observation of high mesenteric SO2 agrees with work in the literature and warrants further exploration.

Due to multispectral acquisition, this inevitably creates a large dataset. To cut down the data volume, sparse sampling methods that reduce the number of detectors have been developed. However, image reconstruction of sparse sampling PAT is challenging because of insufficient angular coverage. During spectral un-mixing, these inaccurate reconstructions will further amplify imaging artefacts and contaminate the results. To solve this problem, we present the interlaced sparse sampling (ISS) PAT, a method that involved: 1) a novel scanning-based image acquisition scheme in which the sparse detector array rotates while switching illumination wavelength, such that a dense angular coverage could be achieved by using only a few detectors; and 2) a corresponding image reconstruction algorithm that makes use of an anatomical prior image created from the ISS strategy to guide PAT image computation. Reconstructed from the signals acquired at different wavelengths (angles), this self-generated prior image fuses multispectral and angular information, and thus has rich anatomical features and minimum artefacts. A specialized iterative imaging model that effectively incorporates this anatomical prior image into the reconstruction process is also developed.

Experimental Design: A clinical study was conducted in order to collect and image fresh, surgical specimens from patients (N = 36) with head and neck cancers undergoing surgical resection. A set of machine-learning tools were developed to quantify hyperspectral images of the resected tissue in order to detect and delineate cancerous regions which were validated by histopathologic diagnosis. More than two million reflectance spectral signatures were obtained by HSI and analyzed using machine-learning methods. The detection results of HSI were compared with autofluorescence imaging and fluorescence imaging of two vital-dyes of the same specimens. Results: Quantitative HSI differentiated cancerous tissue from normal tissue in ex vivo surgical specimens with a sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 91%, respectively, and which was more accurate than autofluorescence imaging (P < 0.05) or fluorescence imaging of 2-NBDG (P < 0.05) and proflavine (P < 0.05). The proposed quantification tools also generated cancer probability maps with the tumor border demarcated and which could provide real-time guidance for surgeons regarding optimal tumor resection. Conclusions: This study highlights the feasibility of using quantitative HSI as a diagnostic tool to delineate the cancer boundaries in surgical specimens, and which could be translated into the clinic application with the hope of improving clinical outcomes in the future.

Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) represents an emerging imaging modality capable of visualizing specific tissue chromophores at high resolution and deep in tissues in vivo by separating their spectral signatures. Whereas single-wavelength images can be acquired by multielement ultrasound detection in real-time imaging, using multiple wavelengths at separate times can lead to image blurring due to motion during acquisition. Therefore, MSOT imaging of the heart results in degraded resolution because of the heartbeat. In this work, we applied a clustering algorithm, k-means, to automatically separate a sequence of single-pulse images at multiple excitation wavelengths into clusters corresponding to different stages of the cardiac cycle. We then performed spectral unmixing on each cluster to obtain images of tissue intrinsic chromophores at different cardiac stages, showing reduced sensitivity to motion compared to signal averaging without clustering. We found that myocardium images of improved resolution and contrast can be achieved using MSOT motion clustering correction. The correction method presented could be generally applied to other MSOT imaging applications prone to motion artifacts, for example, by respiration and heartbeat.

During Afib treatment, clinicians aim to repress unusual electrical activity by electrically isolating the pulmonary veins (PV) from the left atrium (LA) using radiofrequency ablation. However, current clinical tools are limited in reliably assessing transmurality of the ablation lesions and detecting the presence of gaps within ablation lines, which can warrant repeat procedures. In this study, we developed an endoscopic multispectral reflectance imaging (eMSI) system for enhanced discrimination of tissue treatment at the PV junction. The system enables direct visualization of cardiac lesions through an endoscope at acquisition rates up to 25 Hz. Five narrowband, high-power LEDs were used to illuminate the sample (450, 530, 625, 810 and 940nm) and combinatory parameters were calculated based on their relative reflectance. A stitching algorithm was employed to generate large field-of-view, multispectral mosaics of the ablated PV junction from individual eMSI images. A total of 79 lesions from 15 swine hearts were imaged, ex vivo. Statistical analysis of the acquired five spectral data sets and ratiometric maps revealed significant differences between transmural lesions, non-transmural lesions around the venoatrial junctions, unablated posterior wall of left atrium tissue, and pulmonary vein (p < 0.0001). A pixel-based quadratic discriminant analysis classifier was applied to distinguish four tissue types: PV, untreated LA, non-transmural and transmural lesions. We demonstrate tissue type classification accuracies of 80.2% and 92.1% for non-transmural and transmural lesions, and 95.0% and 92.8% for PV and untreated LA sites, respectively.

Therefore, we have developed dynamic imaging methods to measure blood flow and hemoglobin oxygen saturation in implanted prevascularized tissues noninvasively and longitudinally. Using laser speckle imaging, multispectral imaging, and intravital microscopy, we demonstrate that fibrin-based tissue implants anastomose with the host (severe combined immunodeficient mice) in as short as 20 h. Anastomosis results in initial perfusion with highly oxygenated blood, and an increase in average hemoglobin oxygenation of 53%. However, shear rates in the preformed vessels were low (20.8 +/- 12.8 s(-1)), and flow did not persist in the vast majority of preformed vessels due to thrombus formation. These findings suggest that designing an appropriate vascular network structure in prevascularized tissues to maintain shear rates above the threshold for thrombosis may be necessary to maintain flow following implantation.

Aim: To develop and evaluate a methodology where a snapshot filter mosaic camera is utilized for imaging skin hemoglobin oxygen saturation (S-O2), using ANNs. Approach: MSI data were acquired during occlusion provocations. ANNs were trained to estimate S-O2 with MSI data as input, targeting data from a validated probe-based reference system. Performance of ANNs with different properties and training data sets was compared. Results: The method enables spatially resolved estimation of skin tissue S-O2. Results are comparable to those acquired using a Monte-Carlo-based approach when relevant training data are used. Conclusions: Training an ANN on in vivo MSI data covering a wide range of target values acquired during an occlusion protocol enable real-time estimation of S-O2 maps.

Beside conventional wound treatment, for instance kinds of oxygen therapy and cold plasma technology have been tested, providing an improvement in the perfusion of wounds and their healing potential, but these methods are unfortunately not sufficiently validated and accepted for clinical practice to date. Using hyperspectral imaging technology in the visible (VIS) and near infrared (NIR) region with high spectral and spatial resolution, perfusion parameters of tissue and wounds can be determined. We present a new compact hyperspectral camera which can be used in clinical practice. From hyperspectral data the hemoglobin oxygenation (StO(2)), the relative concentration of hemoglobin [tissue hemoglobin index (THI)] and the so-called NIR-perfusion index can be determined. The first two parameters are calculated from the VIS-part of the spectrum and represent the perfusion of superficial tissue layers, whereas the NIR-perfusion index is calculated from the NIR-part representing the perfusion in deeper layers. First clinical measurements of transplanted flaps and chronic ulcer wounds show, that the perfusion level can be determined quantitatively allowing sensitive evaluation and monitoring for an optimization of the wound treatment planning and for validation of new treatment methods.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "Fluorescence- and multispectral optoacoustic imaging for an optimized detection of deeply located tumors in an orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic carcinoma", "abstract": "A crucial point for the management of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the decrease of R1 resections.

The peptide cRGD, conjugated with the near infrared fluorescent (NIRF) dye IRDye800CW and with a trans-cyclooctene (TCO) tag for future click chemistry (cRGD-800CW-TCO), was applied to PDAC bearing immunodeficient nude mice; 27 days after orthotopic transplantation of human AsPC-1 cells into the head of the pancreas, mice were injected with cRGD-800CW-TCO and imaged with fluorescence- and optoacoustic devices before and 2, 6 and 24 hr after injection, before they were sacrificed and dissected with a guidance of FGS imaging system.

To address this need, non-invasive, quantitative optical imaging techniques were developed to assess the time-course of recovery in the mouse HLI model. Hyperspectral imaging and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were used to non-invasively image hemoglobin oxygen saturation and microvessel morphology plus blood flow, respectively, in the anesthetized mouse after induction of HLI. Hyperspectral imaging detected significant increases in hemoglobin saturation in the ischemic paw as early as 3 days after femoral artery ligation (P < 0.01), and significant increases in distal blood flow were first detected with OCT 14 days postsurgery (P < 0.01). Intravital OCT images of the adductor muscle vasculature revealed corkscrew collateral vessels characteristic of the arteriogenic response to HLI. The hyperspectral imaging and OCT data significantly correlated with each other and with laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) and tissue oxygenation sensor data (P < 0.01). However, OCT measurements acquired depth-resolved information and revealed more sustained flow deficits following surgery that may be masked by more superficial measurements (LDPI, hyperspectral imaging).

This unmixing was performed on a pixel-by-pixel basis to generate distribution maps of each individual dye, and then motion correction was done, followed by a convolution correction to account for delivery differences.

Immunocytochemistry showed that liposomes preferentially bound to and released their contents into cells expressing high levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor. We determined that the contents of the liposome were released into the cell as noted by the change in propidium iodide fluorescence from green to red based upon nucleic acid binding. In an orthotopic mouse model, the liposomes preferentially targeted the pancreatic tumor with little off-target binding in the liver and spleen. Peak accumulation of the liposomes in the tumor occurred at 8 h post-injection. Multispectral optoacoustic tomographic imaging was able to provide high-resolution 3D images of the tumor and liposome location.

Area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operator characteristic was used as the main evaluation metric. Additionally, the performance was estimated in mm increments circumferentially from the tumor-normal margin. In intra-patient experiments, HSI classified conventional SCC with an AUC of 0.82 up to 3 mm from the cancer margin, which was more accurate than proflavin dye and autofluorescence (both p < 0.05). Intra-patient autofluorescence imaging detected human papilloma virus positive (HPV+) SCC with an AUC of 0.99 at 3 mm and greater accuracy than proflavin dye (p < 0.05). The inter-patient results showed that reflectance-based HSI and autofluorescence imaging outperformed proflavin dye and standard red, green, and blue (RGB) images (p < 0.05). In new patients, HSI detected conventional SCC in the larynx, oropharynx, and nasal cavity with 0.85-0.95 AUC score, and autofluorescence imaging detected HPV+ SCC in tonsillar tissue with 0.91 AUC score. This study demonstrates that label-free, reflectance-based HSI and autofluorescence imaging methods can accurately detect the cancer margin in ex-vivo specimens within minutes. This non-ionizing optical imaging modality could aid surgeons and reduce inadequate surgical margins during SCC resections.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "In vivo accuracy of multispectral magnetic resonance imaging for identifying lipid-rich necrotic cores and intraplaque hemorrhage in advanced human carotid plaques", "abstract": "Background-High-resolution MRI has been shown to be capable of identifying plaque constituents, such as the necrotic core and intraplaque hemorrhage, in human carotid atherosclerosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate differential contrast-weighted images, specifically a multispectral MR technique, to improve the accuracy of identifying the lipid-rich necrotic core and acute intraplaque hemorrhage in vivo. Methods and Results-Eighteen patients scheduled for carotid endarterectomy underwent a preoperative carotid MRI examination in a 1.5-T GE Signa scanner using a protocol that generated 4 contrast weightings (T1, T2, proton density, and 3D time of flight). MR images of the vessel wall were examined for the presence of a lipid-rich necrotic core and/or intraplaque hemorrhage. Ninety cross sections were compared with matched histological sections of the excised specimen in a double-blinded fashion. Overall accuracy (95% CI) of multispectral MRI was 87% (80% to 94%), sensitivity was 85% (78% to 92%), and specificity was 92% (86% to 98%). There was good agreement between MRI and histological findings, with a value of kappa =0.69 (0.53 to 0.85). Conclusions-Multispectral MRI can identify the lipid-rich necrotic core in human carotid atherosclerosis in vivo with high sensitivity and specificity. This MRI technique provides a noninvasive tool to study the pathogenesis and natural history of carotid atherosclerosis.

The significant captured data in HSI can be useful for classifying different types of brain tissues, since they gather reflectance values from different band widths below and beyond the visual spectrum. This allows ML algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) to classify brain tissues such as tumors. Predicted results can be used to create visualizations and support neurosurgeons before injuring any tissue. This way neurosurgeons can be more precise, reducing any possible damages on healthy tissues. In this work, a proposal for the classification of in-vivo brain hyperspectral images using SVM and RF classifiers is presented. A total of four hyperspectral images from four different patients with glioblastoma grade IV (GBM) brain tumor have been selected to train models and, therefore, classify them. Five different classes have been defined during experiments: healthy tissue, tumor, venous blood vessel, arterial blood vessel and dura mater. Results obtained suggest that SVM usually performs better than RF, generally achieving up to 97% of mean accuracy (ACC). However, RF performance had better results than SVM when classifying images used during training, obtaining almost 100% of mean ACC for all 5 classes described.

Up until now, HSI has been used in conjunction with rigid endoscopy to detect cancer in vivo. The logical next step is to pair HSI with flexible endoscopy, since it improves access to hard-to-reach areas. While the flexible endoscope's fiber optic cables provide the advantage of flexibility, they also introduce an interfering honeycomb-like pattern onto images. Due to the substantial impact this pattern has on locating cancerous tissue, it must be removed before the HS data can be further processed. Thereby, the loss of information is to minimize avoiding the suppression of small-area variations of pixel values. We have developed a system that uses flexible endoscopy to record HS cubes of the larynx and designed a special filtering technique to remove the honeycomb-like pattern with minimal loss of information. We have confirmed its feasibility by comparing it to conventional filtering techniques using an objective metric and by applying unsupervised and supervised classifications to raw and pre-processed HS cubes.

DA-OCT offers a 100-fold speed increase compared with its predecessor, multispectral multiple-scattering low coherence interferometry (ms2/LCI), by using a new beam scanning mechanism based on a microelectro-mechanical system (MEMS) mirror. The data acquisition scheme was altered to take advantage of this scanning speed, producing tomographic images at a rate of 4 frames (B-scans) per second. DA-OCT differs from ms2/LCI in that the dual axes intersect at a shallower depth (similar to 1 mm). This difference, coupled with the faster scanning speed, shifts the detection priority from multiply scattered to ballistic light. The utility of this approach was demonstrated by imaging both ex vivo porcine ear skin and in vivo rat skin from a McFarlane flap model. The enhanced penetration depth provided by the DA-OCT system will be beneficial to various clinical applications in dermatology and surgery.

Recent development in molecular imaging provides new insights into the diagnostic and therapeutic evaluation of different inflammatory diseases as well as diseases involving inflammation such as cancer. While conventional imaging techniques used in the clinical setting provide only indirect measures of inflammation such as increased perfusion and altered endothelial permeability, optical imaging is able to report molecular information on diseased tissue and cells. Optical imaging is a quick, noninvasive, nonionizing, and easy-to-use diagnostic technology which has been successfully applied for preclinical research. Further development of optical imaging technology such as optoacoustic imaging overcomes the limitations of mere fluorescence imaging, thereby enabling pilot clinical applications in humans. By means of endogenous and exogenous contrast agents, sites of inflammation can be accurately visualized in vivo. This allows for early disease detection and specific disease characterization, enabling more rapid and targeted therapeutic interventions.

Biodistribution analysis by optical imaging is desirable due to its low cost, wide accessibility, and high throughput nature, but it is substantially less accurate than isotopic and chemical techniques. In this work, we developed multimodal probes for optical and nuclear imaging to analyze the quantitative limits of optical contrast in the red and near-infrared spectra for polysaccharide nanocarriers targeting macrophage cells. Probes incorporating three zwitterionic fluorophores together with radioactive copper distributed diffusely to optically dissimilar tissues that were either white (visceral adipose tissue) or dark red (liver and spleen) in obese rodents. We used in vivo positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging, in vivo hyperspectral tomographic fluorescence imaging, and ex vivo optical and isotopic analyses to determine correlations between optical and nuclear signals. PET imaging strongly correlated with standardized ex vivo methods for all tissue types, whereas no fluorescence signals exhibited substantial accuracy in quantification or localization in vivo. Optical imaging of resected tissues was most accurate in the 700 nm wavelength window, but only in white tissues. This work suggests that fluorescence can be used to measure diffuse probe distribution in white tissues over time or across animals, but not red tissues and not deep in the body.

Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is an emerging non-invasive biomedical imaging modality that has potential for intraoperative micrographic control of surgical margins. This is the first study to assess the feasibility of PA imaging for the detection of periocular skin cancer. Eleven patients underwent surgical excision of periocular skin cancer, one of which was a malignant melanoma (MM), eight were basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), and two squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Six tumors were located in the eyelid, and five in periocular skin. The excised samples, as well as healthy eyelid samples, were scanned with PA imaging postoperatively, using 59 wavelengths in the range 680-970 nm, to generate 3D multispectral images. Spectral unmixing was performed using endmember spectra for oxygenated and deoxygenated Hb, melanin, and collagen, to identify the chromophore composition of tumors and healthy eyelid tissue. After PA scanning, the tumor samples were examined histopathologically using standard hematoxylin and eosin staining. The PA spectra of healthy eyelid tissue were dominated by melanin in the skin, oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the orbicularis oculi muscle, and collagen in the tarsal plate. Multiwavelength 3D scanning provided spectral information on the three tumor types. The spectrum from the MM was primarily reconstructed by the endmember melanin, while the SCCs showed contributions primarily from melanin, but also HbR and collagen. BCCs showed contributions from all four endmembers with a predominance of HbO(2) and HbR.

It can be challenging to visualise nerves with conventional ultrasound imaging, however. One of the challenges is that nerves can have very similar appearances to nearby structures such as tendons. Several recent studies have highlighted the potential of near-infrared optical spectroscopy for differentiating nerves and adjacent tissues, as this modality can be sensitive to optical absorption of lipids that are present in intra- and extra-neural adipose tissue and in the myelin sheaths. These studies were limited to point measurements, however. In this pilot study, a custom photoacoustic system with a clinical ultrasound imaging probe was used to acquire multi-spectral photoacoustic images of nerves and tendons from swine ex vivo, across the wavelength range of 1100 to 1300 nm. Photoacoustic images were processed and overlaid in colour onto co-registered conventional ultrasound images that were acquired with the same imaging probe. A pronounced optical absorption peak centred at 1210 nm was observed in the photoacoustic signals obtained from nerves, and it was absent in those obtained from tendons. This absorption peak, which is consistent with the presence of lipids, provides a novel image contrast mechanism to significantly enhance the visualization of nerves. In particular, image contrast for nerves was up to 5.5 times greater with photoacoustic imaging (0.82 +/- 0.15) than with conventional ultrasound imaging (0.148 +/- 0.002), with a maximum contrast of 0.95 +/- 0.02 obtained in photoacoustic mode.

However, by the wider applicability of dewaxed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples in the hospital, an abundant tissue bank is a useful resource for the on-site retrospective research to improve diagnosis accuracy. Therefore, we implemented an ex vivo Raman spectroscopic study combined multivariate analysis methods for presenting a better understanding of the sample processing effects and testifying the potential Raman based pathological analysis capabilities of FFPE sections. By comparing 600 spectra from thirty-six fresh frozen (n=18) and FFPE breast tissue samples (n=18), including Healthy tissue, Ductal Carcinoma In Situ, and Invasive Ductal Carcinoma tissue, the results demon-strated that the dewaxing process significantly altered the biochemical composition of the tissues, particularly lipids, proteins, and carotenoids.

We further examined the ability to detect known molecular signatures by constructing spectral libraries of common endogenous fluorophores and applying multiple spectral analysis techniques on test images from lung, liver and kidney. Spectral deconvolution revealed structure-specific morphologic contrast generated from pure molecule signatures.

Materials and methods: Hyperspectral Imaging was performed in vivo and 30 bands from 390 to 680 nm for 5 cases of laryngeal disorders (2x hemorrhagic polyp, 3x leukoplakia) were obtained. Image stacks were processed with unsupervised clustering (linear spectral unmixing), spectral signatures were extracted from unlabeled cluster maps and subsequently applied as end-members for supervised classification (spectral angle mapper) of further medical cases with identical diagnosis. Results: Linear spectral unmixing clearly highlighted altered mucosa as single spectral clusters in all cases. Matching classes were identified, and extracted spectral signatures could readily be applied for supervised classifications. Automatic target detection performed well, as the considered classes showed notable correspondence with pathological tissue locations. Conclusions: Using hyperspectral classification procedures derived from remote sensing applications for diagnostic purposes can create concrete benefits for the medical field. The approach shows that it would be rewarding to collect spectral signatures from histologically different lesions of laryngeal disorders in order to build up a spectral library and to prospectively allow non-invasive optical biopsies.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "Pilot study to visualise and measure skin tissue oxygenation, erythema, total haemoglobin and melanin content using index maps in healthy controls", "abstract": "We report on a method for analysing multispectral images of skin in vivo for the measurement and visualisation of skin characteristics.

There is a high rate of underdiagnosis because BCC is frequently confused with certain common benign lesions and is often indistinguishable from the surrounding healthy tissue. In the present study, a multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) dermoscopy system, designed for imaging and analyzing the autofluorescence emission of skin tissue, was used to image thirty-eight patients with diagnosed nodular BCC (nBCC) lesions, using clinically acceptable levels of excitation light exposure. With this system, skin autofluorescence was imaged simultaneously using three emission bands: 390 +/- 20 nm, 452 +/- 22 nm, and > 496 nm, preferentially targeting collagen, NADH, and FAD autofluorescence, respectively. Statistical classifiers based on FLIm features developed to discriminate BCC from healthy tissue showed promising performance (ROC area-under-the-curve of 0.82).

Novel advanced direct visualization techniques that require less time, cost, and resource investment than electron microscopy (EM) are needed for identifying and locating ENMs in biological samples. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) combines spectrophotometry and imaging, using advanced optics and algorithms to capture a spectrum from 400 to 1000 nm at each pixel in an enhanced dark-field microscopic (EDFM) image. HSI-EDFM can be used to confirm the identity of the materials of interest in a sample and generate an image mapping their presence and location in a sample. Hyperspectral mapping is particularly important for biological samples, where ENM morphology is visually indistinct from surrounding tissue structures. While use of HSI (without mapping) is increasing, no studies to date have compared results from hyperspectral mapping with conventional methods. Thus, the objective of this study was to utilize EDFM-HSI to locate, identify, and map metal oxide ENMs in ex vivo histological porcine skin tissues, a toxicological model of cutaneous exposure, and compare findings with those of Raman spectroscopy (RS), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results demonstrate that EDFM-HSI mapping is capable of locating and identifying ENMs in tissue, as confirmed by conventional methods. This study serves as initial confirmation of EDFM-HSI mapping as a novel and higher throughput technique for ENM identification in biological samples, and serves as the basis for further protocol development utilizing EDFM-HSI for semiquantitation of ENMs. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "Imaging molecular signatures for clinical detection of scleroderma in the hand by multispectral photoacoustic elastic tomography", "abstract": "Scleroderma (SD) is a rare autoimmune disease, which is divided into 2 categories: the localized SD and systemic SD.

Endogenous fluorescence was excited with 365-nm light and imaged in eight emission bands collectively covering the 400- to 640-nm range. Linear discriminant analysis was used to classify all image pixels and generate diagnostic maps of the ovaries. Training the classifier with previously collected single-point autofluorescence measurements of a spectroscopic probe enabled this novel classification. The process by which probe-collected spectra were transformed for comparison with imager spectra is described. Sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 51% were obtained in classifying normal and cancerous ovaries using autofluorescence data alone. Specificity increased to 69% when autofluorescence data were divided by green reflectance data to correct for spatial variation in tissue absorption properties. Benign neoplasm ovaries were also found to classify as nonmalignant using the same algorithm.

This progress has been largely supported by the development of advanced tomographic imaging technologies suitable for obtaining volumetric visualization of bio-marker distributions in small animals at a whole-body or whole-organ scale, an imaging frontier that is not accessible by the existing tissue-sectioning microscopic techniques due to intensive light scattering beyond the depth of a few hundred microns. Major examples of such recently developed optical imaging modalities are reviewed here, including bioluminescence tomography (BLT), fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT), and optical projection tomography (OPT). The pharmaceutical imaging community has quickly appropriated itself of these novel forms of optical imaging, since they come with very compelling advantages, such as quantitative three-dimensional capabilities, direct correlation to the biological cultures, easiness and cost-effectiveness of use, and the use of safe non-ionizing radiation.

The spectral profile of near infrared excitation light used in optoacoustic tomography instruments is modified by absorption and scattering as it propagates deep into biological tissue. The resulting images therefore provide only qualitative insight into the distribution of tissue chromophores. Knowledge of the spectral profile of excitation light across the mouse is needed for accurate determination of the absorption coefficient in vivo. Under the conditions of constant Griineisen parameter and accurate knowledge of the light fluence, a linear relationship should exist between the initial optoacoustic pressure amplitude and the tissue absorption coefficient. Using data from a commercial optoacoustic tomography system, we implemented an iterative optimization based on the 6-Eddington approximation to the Radiative Transfer Equation to derive a light fluence map within a given object. We segmented the images based on the positions of phantom inclusions, or mouse organs, and used known scattering coefficients for initialization. Performing the fluence correction in simple phantoms allowed the expected linear relationship between recorded and independently measured absorption coefficients to be retrieved and spectral coloring to be compensated. For in vivo data, the correction resulted in an enhancement of signal intensities in deep tissues. This improved our ability to visualize organs at depth (> 5mm).

Many endogenous fluorophores, specifically, collagen, elastin, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), are found throughout the human body. In fluorescence imaging scenarios, these signals can be prohibitive as they can outcompete signals introduced for diagnostic purposes. However, autofluorescence also contains information that has diagnostic value. Recent advances in hyperspectral imaging have allowed the acquisition of significantly more data in a shorter time period by scanning the excitation spectra of fluorophores. The reduced acquisition time and increased signal- to-noise ratio allow for separation of significantly more fluorophores than previously possible. We propose to utilize excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging of autofluorescence to differentiate neoplastic lesions from surrounding non-neoplastic normal tissue. The spectra of isolated autofluorescent molecules are obtained using a custom inverted microscope (TE-2000, Nikon Instruments) with an Xe arc lamp and thin-film tunable filter array (VersaChrome, Semrock, Inc.). Scans utilize excitation wavelengths from 360 to 550 nm in 5-nm increments. The resultant molecule-specific spectra are used to analyze hyperspectral image stacks from normal and neoplastic colorectal tissues. Due to a limited number of samples, neoplastic tissues examined here are a pool of both colorectal adenocarcinoma and adenomatous polyps. The hyperspectral images are analyzed with ENVI software and custom MATLAB scripts, including linear spectral unmixing. Initial results indicate the ability to separate signals of endogenous fluorophores and measure the relative concentrations of fluorophores among healthy and diseased states, in this case, normal colon versus neoplastic colon. These results suggest pathology-specific changes to endogenous fluorophores can be detected using excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging. Future work will focus on expanding the library of pure molecules, exploring histogram distance metrics as a means for identifying deviations in spectral signatures, and examining more defined disease states.

Intraoperative hemodynamic imaging is needed to perform cerebrovascular reconstruction safely and effectively. Optical intrinsic signal (OIS) imaging is commonly used for assessing cerebral hemodynamics in experimental studies, because it can provide high-resolution mapping images. However, OIS is not used clinically due to algorithm, instrumentation and spectral resolution limitations. We tested the feasibility of a hyperspectral camera (HSC) for assessment of cortical hemodynamics with spectral imaging of the cerebral cortex in rats and in vivo humans. A hyperspectral camera (HSC) was tested in a rat model of cerebral ischemia (middle cerebral artery occlusion) and during human revascularization surgery (STA-MCA anastomosis). Changes in cortical oxygen saturation were derived from spectral imaging data (400-800 nm) collected by exposing the cortex to Xenon light. Reflected light was sampled using the HSC. The system was then tested intraoperatively during superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery anastomosis procedures. Comparison with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging data was done. During middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats, the HSC technique showed a significant decrease in cortical oxygen saturation in the ischemic hemisphere. In clinical cases, the cortical oxygen saturation was increased after STA-MCA anastomosis, which agreed with the SPECT imaging data. Continuous collection of imaging spectroscopic data is feasible and may provide reliable quantification of the hemodynamic responses in the brain.

Spectral characterization of infected leaf tissue of cvs 'Regent' and 'Solaris' with resistance genes Rpv 3-1 and Rpv 10 and Rpv 3-3, respectively, suggested that resistance is not dependent on large-scale necrotization of host tissue. Reactions of the resistant cultivars and a reference susceptible to P. viticola were studied using hyperspectral imaging (range 400-1000 nm) at the tissue level and microscopic techniques. Resistance of both cultivars was incomplete and allowed pathogen reproduction. Spectral vegetation indices characterized the host response to pathogen invasion; the vitality of infected and necrotic leaf tissue differed significantly. Resistance depended on local accumulation of polyphenols in response to haustorium formation and was more effective for cv. 'Solaris'. Although hypersensitive reaction of some cells prevented colonization of palisade parenchyma, resistance was not associated with extensive necrotization of tissue, and the biotrophic pathogen survived localized death of penetrated host cells. Hyperspectral imaging was suitable to characterize and differentiate the resistance reactions of grapevine cultivars by mapping of the cellular response to pathogen attack on the tissue level and yields useful information on host-pathogen interactions.

Most chemotherapeutic agents exert their antitumoral effects by rapid induction of apoptosis. Another main feature of breast cancer is hypoxia, which may drive malignant progression and confer resistance to various forms of therapy. Thus, multi-aspect imaging of both tumor apoptosis and oxygenation in vivo would be of enormous value for the effective evaluation of therapy response. Herein, we demonstrate the capability of a hybrid imaging modality known as multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) to provide high-resolution, simultaneous imaging of tumor apoptosis and oxygenation, based on both the exogenous contrast of an apoptosis-targeting dye and the endogenous contrast of hemoglobin. MSOT imaging was applied on mice bearing orthotopic 4T1 breast tumors before and following treatment with doxorubicin. Apoptosis was monitored over time by imaging the distribution of xPLORE-APOFL750 (c), a highly sensitive poly-caspase binding apoptotic probe, within the tumors. Oxygenation was monitored by tracking the distribution of oxy- and deoxygenated hemoglobin within the same tumor areas. Doxorubicin treatment induced an increase in apoptosis-depending optoacoustic signal of xPLORE-APOFL750 (c) at 24 h after treatment. Furthermore, our results showed spatial correspondence between xPLORE-APO750 (c) and deoxygenated hemoglobin.

In this study we investigated a computational method that uses only multispectral information and quantitatively computes tissue oxygen saturation independently of tissue optical properties. The method is based on linear transformations of measurements in three isosbestic points. We investigated the ideal isosbestic point combination out of six isosbestic points available for measurement in the visible and near-infrared region that enable accurate oxygen saturation computation.

However, identification of nerves and small blood vessels can be very challenging, and accidental intra-neural or intra-vascular injections can result in significant complications. Multi-spectral photoacoustic imaging can provide high sensitivity and specificity for discriminating hemoglobin-and lipid-rich tissues. However, conventional surface-illumination-based photoacoustic systems suffer from limited sensitivity at large depths. In this study, for the first time, an interventional multispectral photoacoustic imaging (IMPA) system was used to image nerves in a swine model in vivo. Pulsed excitation light with wavelengths in the ranges of 750 - 900 nm and 1150 - 1300 nm was delivered inside the body through an optical fiber positioned within the cannula of an injection needle.

An example of such a delicate procedure is thyroid and parathyroid surgery, where iatrogenic injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve can result in transient or permanent vocal problems (0.5-2.0% reported incidence). A camera system, enabling nerve-specific image enhancement, would be useful in preventing such complications. This might be realized with hyperspectral camera technology using silicon (Si) or indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) sensor chips. Methods: As a first step towards such a camera, we evaluated the performance of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy by analysing spectra collected during 18 thyroid and parathyroid resections. We assessed the contrast information present in two different spectral ranges, for respectively Si and InGaAs sensors. Two hundred fifty three in vivo, wide-band diffuse reflectance spectra (350-1,830 nm range, 1 nm resolution) were acquired on 52 tissue spots, including nerve (n-22), muscle (n-12), and adipose tissue (n-18). We extracted 36 features from these spectroscopic data: 18 gradients and 18 amplitude differences at predefined points in the tissue spectra. Best distinctive feature combinations were established using binary logistic regression. Classification performance was evaluated in a cross-validation (CV) approach by leaveone-out (LOO). To generalize nerve recognition applicability, we performed a train-test (TT) validation using the thyroid and parathyroid surgery data for training purposes and carpal tunnel release surgery data (10 nerve spots and 5 adipose spots) for classification purposes. Results: For combinations of two distinctive spectral features, LOO revealed an accuracy of respectively 78% for Si-sensors and 95% for InGaAs-sensors.

The use of multiple narrow wavelength bands in the near infrared (NIR) range theoretically allows not only to image brain tissue oxygenation and hemodynamics via mapping of hemoglobin concentration changes, but also to directly quantify cerebral metabolism via measurement of the redox states of mitochondrial cytochrome-c-oxidase (CCO). The aim of this study is to assess the possibility of performing hyperspectral imaging of in vivo cerebral oxyhemoglobin (HbO(2)), deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) and oxidized CCO (oxCCO) using commercially available HSI devices. For this reason, a hyperspectral snapshot solution based on Cubert GmbH technology (S185 FireflEYE camera) has been tested on the exposed cortex of mice during normoxic, hypoxic and hyperoxic conditions. The system allows simultaneous acquisition of 138 wavelength bands between 450 and 998 nm, with spectral sampling and resolution of similar to 4 to 8 nm. From the hyperspectral data, relative changes in concentration of hemoglobin and oxCCO are estimated and hemodynamic and metabolic maps of the imaged cortex are calculated for two different NIR spectral ranges.

Microscopic imaging of fresh tissue samples can circumvent the cost and time associated with conventional histology. Further, intrinsic contrast can provide rich information about a tissue's composition, structure and function, and opens the potential for in-vivo imaging without the need for contrast agents. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we used hyperspectral two-photon microscopy to explore the characteristics of both normal and diseased gastrointestinal (GI) tissues, relying only on their endogenous fluorescence and second harmonic generation to provide contrast. We obtained hyperspectral data at subcellular resolution by acquiring images over a range of two-photon excitation wavelengths, and found excitation spectral signatures of specific tissue types based on our ability to clearly visualize morphology. We present the two-photon excitation spectral properties of four major tissue types that are present throughout the GI tract: epithelium, lamina propria, collagen, and lymphatic tissue. Using these four excitation signatures as basis spectra, linear unmixing strategies were applied to hyperspectral data sets of both normal and neoplastic tissue acquired in the colon and small intestine. Our results show that hyperspectral unmixing with excitation spectra allows segmentation, showing promise for blind identification of tissue types within a field of view, analogous to specific staining in conventional histology. The intrinsic spectral signatures of these tissue types provide information relating to their biochemical composition.

Such high resolution fluorescence imaging is hampered by unwanted signal from intrinsic background fluorescence and scattered light. The signal to background ratio can be improved by using extrinsic contrast agents and greatly enhanced by multispectral imaging methods. Unfortunately, these methods are insufficient for deep tissue imaging where high contrast and speedy acquisition are necessary. Fluorescence lifetime (FLT) is an inherent characteristic of each fluorescent species that can be independent of intensity and spectral properties. Accordingly, FLT-based detection provides an additional contrast mechanism to optical measurements. This contrast is particularly important in the near-infrared (NIR) due to relative transparency of tissue as well as the broad absorption and emission spectra of dyes that are active in this region. Here we report comparative analysis of signal distribution of several NIR fluorescent polymethine dyes in living mice and their correlations with lifetimes obtained in vitro using solution models. The FLT data obtained from dyes dissolved in serum albumin solution correlated well with FLTs measured in vivo. Thus the albumin solution model could be used as a good predictive model for in vivo FLT behavior of newly developed fluorescent reporters. Subsequent experiments in vivo, including monitoring slow release kinetics and detecting proteinuria, demonstrate the complementary nature of FLT for fluorescence intensity imaging.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "Biodistribution Survey of Oxidized Single-Wall Carbon Nanohorns Following Different Administration Routes by Using Label-Free Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography", "abstract": "Introduction: Though widely studied for biomedical applications, the lack of current systemic studies on the in vivo fate of single-walled carbon nanohorns (SWCNHs) largely restricts their further applications, as real-time monitoring of their biodistribution remains a big challenge. Here, we aim to customize a label-free multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) method and systematically survey the fate of oxidized SWCNHs (SWCNHox) following different exposure routes by whole body imaging. Methods: Mice were given a suspension of SWCNHox with an average size of 136.4 nm via four different administration routes, and then imaged by MSOT. Results: After oral gavage, SWCNHox were mainly distributed in the gastrointestinal tract then excreted through the gut. Compared with the observation post first dosing, the accumulation of SWCNHox in the gastrointestinal tract was not obvious even after four-time oral gavage. Almost no SWCNHox were found at detectable levels in kidney, liver, blood and spleen. Following intravenous (iv) injection, SWCNHox were mainly presented and persisted in the spleen and liver, while very little in the kidney and almost none detectable in the intestine. SWCNHox accumulated significantly in the liver and spleen after four IV administrations. Following hypodermic and intramuscular injections, almost no SWCNHox could cross biological barriers and transport to the spleen, kidney or liver, likely due to their very low absorption rate. Almost all SWCNHox remained around the injection sites. For the first time, we have systematically investigated the in vivo fate of SWCNHs in a label-free and real-time manner.

The combination of the multispectral information from the two spectroscopic modalities has been shown to be an effective method to screen for cervical cancer. There has however been a relative paucity of work in identifying the individual spectral components that contribute to the measured fluorescence and reflectance spectra. This work aims to identify the constituent source spectra and their concentrations. We used non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) numerical methods to decompose the mixed multispectral data into the constituent spectra and their corresponding concentrations. NNMF is an iterative approach that factorizes the measured data into non-negative factors. The factors are chosen to minimize the root-mean-squared residual error. NNMF has shown promise for feature extraction and identification in the fields of text mining and spectral data analysis. Since both the constituent source spectra and their corresponding concentrations are assumed to be non-negative by nature NNMF is a reasonable approach to deconvolve the measured multispectral data. Supervised learning methods were then used to determine which of the constituent spectra sources best predict the amount of neoplasia. The constituent spectra sources found to best predict neoplasia were then compared with spectra of known biological chromophores.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "Non-invasive in vivo tracking of fibrin degradation by fluorescence imaging", "abstract": "Fibrin-based sealants consist of natural coagulation factors involved in the final phase of blood coagulation, during which fibrinogen is enzymatically converted by thrombin to form a solid-phase fibrin clot.

Hence, it is desirable to follow the kinetics of fibrinolysis at the application site. Non-invasive molecular imaging systems enable real-time tracking of processes in the living animal. In this study, a non-invasive fluorescence based imaging system was applied to follow and quantify site-specific degradation of fibrin sealant. To enable non-invasive tracking of fibrin in vivo, fibrin-matrix was labelled by incorporation of a fluorophore-conjugated fibrinogen component. Protein degradation and release of fluorescence were, in a first step, correlated in vitro. In vivo, fluorophore-labelled fibrin was subcutaneously implanted in mice and followed throughout the experiment using a multispectral imaging system. For the fluorescent fibrin, degradation correlated with the release of fluorescence from the clots in vitro. In vivo it was possible to follow and quantify implanted fibrin clots throughout the experiment, demonstrating degradation kinetics of approximately 16days in the subcutaneous compartment, which was further confirmed by histological evaluation of the application site.

As a first step toward that goal, we evaluated the effectiveness of a fluorescent and luminescent nanoparticle for in vitro and ex vivo imaging of porcine gametes. Methods: Freshly harvested boar sperm were labeled with red-shifted (655 nm) quantum dot nanoparticles conjugated (QD+) or not (QD-) with plasminogen antibody and evaluated. Subsets of labeled spermatozoa were loaded into straws and placed within the lumen of gilt reproductive tracts for ex vivo intra-uterine imaging. Porcine cumuluso-ocyte complexes (COCs) were matured in the presence of QD- or QD+. Ovarian follicles were microinjected with QD- or QD+ and placed in culture for up to 4 days. After labeling, all samples were supplemented with coelenterazine, the luciferase substrate, and immediately submitted to bioluminescence analysis, followed by fluorescence and hyperspectral imaging. Data were analyzed with ANOVA and P < 0.05 indicated significant differences. Results: All labeled-samples revealed bioluminescence emission that was confirmed by fluorescence and hyperspectral imaging of the QD localization within the cells and tissues. Over 76% of spermatozoa and both immature and mature COCs were successfully labeled with QD- or QD+. The QD- fluorescence appeared homogenously distributed in the oocytes, while found in the entire sperm length with a higher accumulation within the mid-piece. Labeled-follicles exhibited a progressive migration of QD nanoparticles within the follicle wall during culture. In contrast, QD+ fluorescence signals appeared condensed and stronger in the follicle cells, sperm head, and sub-plasma membrane area of mature oocytes. Weaker QD+ signals were detected in the cumulus cells. Fluorescence and hyperspectral microscope imaging showed comparable intracellular QD localization. Ex-vivo intra-uterine bioluminescence imaging of labeled spermatozoa revealed stronger signals captured over the oviducts, with uterine body allowing the lowest signal detection.

Accordingly, it accounts for phenomena that significantly affect skin spectral signatures, both within and outside the visible domain, such as detour and sieve effects, that are overlooked by existing skin appearance models. Using a first-principles approach, the proposed model computes the surface and subsurface scattering components of skin reflectance taking into account not only the wavelength and the illumination geometry, but also the positional dependence of the reflected light.

The performance of the n-order simplified spherical harmonics approximation (SPn) in different spectra is evaluated, and a multispectral hybrid CLT based on the combination of different SPn models is proposed to handle the Cerenkov photon transport problem in complex media. The in vivo xenograft experiment shows that this approach can effectively improve the quality and accuracy of the reconstructed light source. We believe that the new reconstruction method will advance the development of CLT for more in vivo imaging applications.

Tissues are heterogeneous in nature; an imaging voxel contains an ensemble of different cells and extracellular matrix components. A long-standing challenge has been to infer the content of and interactions among these microscopic tissue components within a macroscopic imaging voxel. Spatially resolved multidimensional relaxation-diffusion correlation (REDCO) spectroscopy holds the potential to deliver such microdynamic information. However, to date, vast data requirements have mostly relegated these type of measurements to nuclear magnetic resonance applications and prevented them from being widely and successfully used in conjunction with imaging. By using a novel data acquisition and processing strategy in this study, spatially resolved REDCO could be performed in reasonable scanning times with excellent prospects for clinical applications. This new MR imaging framework-which we term magnetic resonance microdynamic imaging (MRMI)-permits the simultaneous noninvasive and model-free quantification of multiple subcellular, cellular, and interstitial tissue microenvironments within a voxel. MRMI is demonstrated with a fixed spinal cord specimen, enabling the quantification of microscopic tissue components with unprecedented specificity. Tissue components, such as axons, neuronal and glial soma, and myelin were identified on the basis of their multispectral signature within individual imaging voxels. These tissue elements could then be composed into images and be correlated with immunohistochemistry findings. MRMI provides novel image contrasts of tissue components and a new family of microdynamic biomarkers that could lead to new diagnostic imaging approaches to probe biological tissue alterations accompanied by pathological or developmental changes.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "Latanoprost Stimulates Ocular Lymphatic Drainage: An In Vivo Nanotracer Study", "abstract": "Purpose: Ocular lymphatics have been recently shown to contribute to aqueous humor outflow. It is not yet known whether lymphatic outflow can be stimulated by pharmacological agents. Here we determine whether latanoprost, a prostaglandin F2 alpha analog commonly used to lower IOP to treat glaucoma, increases lymphatic drainage from the eye. Methods: Lymphatic drainage in mice was assessed in vivo, in 11 latanoprost-treated and 11 control animals using hyperspectral imaging at multiple times following quantum dot (QD) injection into the eye. QD signal intensity was also measured in tissue sections using hyperspectral imaging. Results: In the latanoprost-treated group, lymphatic drainage rate into the submandibular lymph node was increased compared with controls (1.23 +/- 1.06 hours(-1) vs. 0.30 +/- 0.17 hours(-1), mean +/- SD, P < 0.02). Total QD signal intensity in the submandibular lymph node was greater in the latanoprost-treated group compared with controls (10.55 +/- 1.12 vs. 9.48 +/- 1.24, log scale, P < 0.05).

Objective To develop the next generation of visualization catheters that can reveal irreversible atrial muscle damage caused by ablation and identify viability gaps between the lesions. Methods Radiofrequency lesions were placed on the endocardial surfaces of excised human and bovine atria and left ventricles of blood perfused rat hearts. Tissue was illuminated with 365nm light and a series of images were acquired from individual spectral bands within 420-720nm range. By extracting spectral profiles of individual pixels and spectral unmixing, the relative contribution of ablated and unablated spectra to each pixel was then displayed. Results of spectral unmixing were compared to lesion pathology. Results RF ablation caused significant changes in the tissue autofluorescence profile. The magnitude of these spectral changes in human left atrium was relatively small (<10% of peak fluorescence value), yet highly significant. Spectral unmixing of hyperspectral datasets enabled high spatial resolution, in-situ delineation of radiofrequency lesion boundaries without the need for exogenous markers. Lesion dimensions derived from hyperspectral imaging approach strongly correlated with histological outcomes. Presence of blood within the myocardium decreased the amplitude of the autofluorescence spectra while having minimal effect on their overall shapes. As a result, the ability of hyperspectral imaging to delineate ablation lesions in vivo was not affected. Conclusions Hyperspectral imaging greatly increases the contrast between ablated and unablated tissue enabling visualization of viability gaps at clinically relevant locations.

In this follow-up study, the authors further extend and validate the approach using eight different tissues and five QDs emission wavelengths, and introduce quantitative imaging performance metrics, namely the threshold QD concentration and wavelength optimization gain. These metrics allow quantification of the improvements through spectral optimization in terms of reduced QD dose and identify the conditions that make the optimization process worthwhile. The authors show that, for most tissues, the most important parameter to optimize is the emission wavelength, yielding improvements of up to four orders of magnitude, followed by the excitation wavelength (up to 20-fold improvement) and the excitation filter bandwidth (up to 50% improvement). The authors also observe, by means of the optimization gain metric, that tissues exhibiting both high autofluorescence and strong pigmentation are generally better candidates for excitation wavelength optimization.

However, imaging and detection of nanomaterials in situ, in wet unfixed and even live samples, such as living isolated cells, microorganisms, protozoans and miniature invertebrates using electron microscopy is practically impossible, because of the elaborate sample preparation requiring chemical fixation, contrast staining, matrix embedding and exposure into vacuum.

During the process of tissue development, an ideal scaffold should remodel at a rate matching with scaffold degradation. To reduce amount of animals sacrificed, non-invasive in vivo imaging of biomaterials is required which relies on using of biocompatible and in situ gel forming compounds carrying suitable imaging agents. In this study we developed a method of in situ fabrication of fluorescently labeled and injectable hyaluronan (HA) hydrogel based on one pot sequential use of Michael addition and thiol-disulfide exchange reactions for the macromolecules labeling and cross-linking respectively. Hydrogels with different content of HA were prepared and their enzymatic degradation was followed in vitro and in vivo using fluorescence multispectral imaging. First, we confirmed that the absorbance of the matrix-linked near-IR fluorescent IRDye (R) 800CW agent released due to the matrix enzymatic degradation in vitro matched the amount of the degraded hydrogel measured by classical gravimetric method. Secondly, the rate of degradation was inversely proportional to the hydrogel concentration and this structure-degradation relationship was similar for both in vitro and in vivo studies. It implies that the degradation of this disulfide cross-linked hyaluronan hydrogel in vivo can be predicted basing on the results of its in vitro degradation studies. The compliance of in vitro and in vivo methods is also promising for the future development of predictive in vitro tissue engineering models. Statement of significance The need for engineered hydrogel scaffolds that deliver bioactive factors to endogenous progenitor cells in vivo via gradual matrix resorption and thus facilitate tissue regeneration is increasing with the aging population. Importantly, scaffold should degrade at a modest rate that will not be too fast to support tissue growth nor too slow to provide space for tissue development.

The accurate diagnosis of intraocular tumors is thereby critical in the management and follow-up of the patients. The diagnosis of intraocular tumors is usually based on clinical examination with acoustic backscattering based ultrasonography.

This microscope maintains scattering insensitivity, while providing high enough spectral resolution on the emitted fluorescence and capitalizing on the wavelength-dependent nonlinear excitation of fluorescent dyes to enable clean separation of multiple, spectrally overlapping labels, in vivo. We demonstrated the utility of this instrument for spectral separation of closely overlapped fluorophores in samples containing 10 different colors of fluorescent beads, live cells expressing up to seven different fluorescent protein fusion constructs, and in multiple in vivo preparations in mouse cortex and inflamed skin, with up to eight different cell types or tissue structures distinguished.

We acquired a hyper-spectral data cube of each patient with wavelengths ranging from 450 to 650 nm at an internal of 2 nm, followed by quantitative analysis of the spectral contribution of three known ingredients in skin tissues: Oxy-hemoglobin( HbO(2)), deoxy-hemoglobin(Hb) and melanin using an Independent Component Correlation Algorithm (ICA) method. Our analysis results suggested that the proportion of melanin and the total hemoglobin in VLS subjects were different from normal subjects. The segmentation of VLS regions based on the index of melanin and total hemoglobin are close to the VLS regions marked by a clinician.

Monitoring the healing response of injured tissue is of high importance for basic research and clinical practice. In traditional application, biological markers characterize normal and abnormal wound healing. Understanding functional relationships of these biological processes is essential for developing new treatment strategies. However, most of the present techniques (in vitro or in vivo) include invasive microscopic or analytical tissue sampling. In the present study, a non-invasive alternative for monitoring processes during wound healing is introduced. Within this context, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an emerging and innovative non-invasive imaging technique with different opportunities in medical applications. HSI acquires the spectral reflectance of an object, depending on its biochemical and structural characteristics. An in-vitro 3-dimensional (3-D) wound model was established and incubated without and with acute and chronic wound fluid (AWF, CWF), respectively. Hyperspectral images of each individual specimen of this 3-D wound model were assessed at day 0/5/10 in vitro, and reflectance spectra were evaluated. For analysing the complex hyperspectral data, an efficient unsupervised approach for clustering massive hyperspectral data was designed, based on efficient hierarchical decomposition of spectral information according to archetypal data points. It represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of an advanced Data Mining approach in context of non-invasive analysis of wounds using hyperspectral imagery. By this, temporal and spatial pattern of hyperspectral clusters were determined within the tissue discs and among the different treatments.

In the proposed approach, Monte Carlo simulation-based empirical formulas are introduced to extract the scattering power b representing the wavelength dependence of light scattering spectrum of skin tissue, as well as the total hemoglobin concentration C-th in dermal vasculatures. The use of isosbestic wavelengths of hemoglobin enables the values of C-th and b to be estimated independently of the oxygenation of hemoglobin. Experiments using in vivo mice two-stage chemical carcinogenesis model are performed to confirm the feasibility of the proposed method for evaluating the changes in cutaneous vasculatures and tissue morphology during tumor initiation, promotion, and progression processes. The experimental results reveal that the changes in scattering power b of back skin are significantly reduced and followed by the increase in total hemoglobin concentration C-th in the carcinogenesis mice group, which indicates morphological changes in skin tissue such as edema and cell swelling caused by tumor promotion and successive angiogenesis along with tumor progression.

Surprisingly, little is known about the critical interaction between the structural composition of the dyes and the pharmacokinetics of the tracers. In this study, a dual-modality tracer design was used to systematically and quantitatively evaluate the influence of elongation of the polymethine chain in a fluorescent cyanine dye on the imaging potential of a targeted tracer. Methods: As a model system, the integrin marker alpha(nu)beta(3) was targeted using arginylglycylaspartisc acid [RGD]-based vectors functionalized with a In-111-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) chelate and a fluorescent dye: (Cy3-(SO3) methyl-COOH [emission wavelength (lambda(em)), 580 nm], Cy5-(SO3) methyl-COOH [lambda(em), 680 nm], or Cy7-(SO3) methyl-COOH [lambda(em), 780 nm]). Tracers were analyzed for differences in photophysical properties, serum protein binding, chemical or optical stability, and signal penetration through tissue. Receptor affinities were evaluated using saturation and competition experiments. In vivo biodistribution (SPECT imaging and percentage injected dose per gram of tissue) was assessed in tumor-bearing mice and complemented with in vivo and ex vivo fluorescence images obtained using a clinical-grade multispectral fluorescence laparoscope. Results: Two carbon-atom-step variations in the polymethine chain of the fluorescent cyanine dyes were shown to significantly influence the chemical and photophysical characteristics (e. g., stability, brightness, and tissue penetration) of the hybrid RGD tracers. DTPA-Cy5-(SO3) methyl-COOH-c[RGDyK] structurally outperformed its Cy3 and Cy7 derivatives. Radioactivity-based evaluation of in vivo tracer pharmacokinetics yielded the lowest nonspecific uptake and highest tumor-to-background ratio for DTPA-Cy5-(SO3) methyl-COOH-c[RGDyK] (13.2 +/- 1.7), with the Cy3 and Cy7 analogs trailing at respective tumor-to-background ratios of 5.7 +/- 0.7 and 4.7 +/- 0.7. Fluorescence-based assessment of tumor visibility revealed a similar trend. Conclusion: These findings underline that variations in the polymethine chain lengths of cyanine dyes have a profound influence on the photophysical properties, stability, and in vivo targeting capabilities of fluorescent imaging tracers. In a direct comparison, the intermediate-length dye (Cy5) yielded a superior c[RGDyK] tracer, compared with the shorter (Cy3) and longer (Cy7) analogs.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "Sparse sampling for fast hyperspectral coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering imaging", "abstract": "We demonstrate a method to increase the acquisition speed in coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) hyperspectral imaging while retaining the relevant spectral information. The method first determines the important spectral components of a sample from a hyperspectral image over a small number of spatial points but a large number of spectral points covering the accessible spectral range and sampling the instrument spectral resolution at the Nyquist limit. From these components we determine a small set of frequencies needed to retrieve the weights of the components with minimum error for a given measurement noise. Hyperspectral images with a large number of spatial points, for example covering a large spatial region, are then measured at this small set of frequencies, and a reconstruction algorithm is applied to generate the full spectral range and resolution. The resulting spectra are suited to retrieve from the CARS intensity the CARS susceptibility which is linear in the concentration, and apply unsupervised quantitative analysis methods such as FSC3 [1]. We demonstrate the method on CARS hyperspectral images of human osteosarcoma U2OS cell, with a reduction in the acquisition time by a factor of 25. This method is suited also for other coherent vibrational microscopy techniques such as stimulated Raman scattering, and in general for hyperspectral imaging techniques with sequential spectral acquisition.

Recently, such treatments have become available in at-home setting due to advent of self-application NAFT devices. Safety and clinical efficacy of NAFT are well established in multiple studies. Less information is available on morphological and functional changes in tissue occurring as a result of NAFT. Polarization-enhanced multispectral wide-field imaging device allows for in vivo real time visualization of dermal structures. The objective of this study is to use this imaging modality to monitor early effects of the home-use NAFT on collagen networks. Materials and MethodsEight subjects (skin types I-III) used a commercially available NAFT device (wavelength 1410nm, energy per pulse up to 15mJ) to treat peri-orbital wrinkles in standard recommended mode, that is daily, for a period of two weeks. In each session, subjects applied a pre-treatment gel to the peri-orbital areas and then used the device, delivering 8-10 applications to each side of the face without overlap. Subjects were asked to use the highest device setting. Cross-polarized 440nm wide-field images were acquired from peri-orbital areas before and two weeks after the onset of the treatment regimen. Wide-field images were normalized and thresholded to a level of 40% brightness to emphasize collagen structure. Collagen content was quantitatively determined from thresholded collagen images. Improvement in collagen content at two weeks of daily treatments was assessed. ResultsEight subjects (age 24-53 years) completed the study. Cross-polarized 440nm wide-field images clearly delineated collagen networks. Quantitative assessment of collagen images revealed statistically significant (P<0.05) improvement of collagen content at a time point of two weeks. Seven out of eight subjects showed varying degree of improvement. The increase of collagen content in responders ranged from 1-26%, with the mean improvement of 11%. Subjects in their early 40s showed the best improvement in comparison to younger and older age groups. ConclusionsPolarization-enhanced multispectral wide-field reflectance imaging method is a suitable technique for noninvasive in vivo assessment of dermal structures. Post-treatment images, taken three days after the last treatment session, demonstrate that non-ablative fractional treatment resulted in increased dermal collagen content as measured by the polarization-enhanced technique as early as two weeks post onset of the treatments. However, further studies with a larger number of subjects and longer treatment period are required to determine the optimal regimen and how long the results will last.

SFDI absorption data are measured at multiple wavelengths and used to fit for the tissue concentration of intrinsic chromophores in each pixel. This is done with a priori knowledge of the basis spectra of common tissue chromophores, such as oxyhemoglobin (ctO(2)Hb), deoxyhemoglobin (ctHHb), water (ctH(2)O), and bulk lipid. The quality of in vivo SFDI fits for the hemoglobin parameters ctO(2)Hb and ctHHb is dependent on wavelength selection, fitting parameters, and acquisition rate. The latter is critical because SFDI acquisition time is up to six times longer than planar two-wavelength multispectral imaging due to projection of multiple-frequency spatial patterns. Thus, motion artifact during in vivo measurements compromises the quality of the reconstruction. Optimal wavelength selection is examined through matrix decomposition of basis spectra, simulation of data, and dynamic in vivo measurements of a human forearm during cuff occlusion. Fitting parameters that minimize cross-talk from additional tissue chromophores, such as water and lipid, are determined. On the basis of this work, a wavelength pair of 670 nm/850 nm is determined to be the optimal two-wavelength combination for in vivo hemodynamic tissue measurements provided that assumptions for water and lipid fractions are made in the fitting process. In our SFDI case study, wavelength optimization reduces acquisition time over 30-fold to 1.5s compared to 50s for a full 34-wavelength acquisition. The wavelength optimization enables dynamic imaging of arterial occlusions with improved spatial resolution due to reduction of motion artifacts.

Fortunately, the survival rate for early diagnosed patients is relatively high. Therefore, in vivo imaging plays an important role for the detection and treatment of the disease. Accurate prostate cancer localization with noninvasive imaging can be used to guide biopsy, radiotheraphy, and surgery as well as to monitor disease progression. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed with an endorectal coil provides higher prostate cancer localization accuracy, when compared to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). However, in general, a single type of MRI is not sufficient for reliable tumor localization. As an alternative, multispectral MRI, i.e., the use of multiple MRI-derived datasets, has emerged as a promising noninvasive imaging technique for the localization of prostate cancer; however almost all studies are with human readers. There is a significant inter and intraobserver variability for human readers, and it is substantially difficult for humans to analyze the large dataset of multispectral MRI. To solve these problems, this study presents an automated localization method using cost-sensitive support vector machines (SVMs) and shows that this method results in improved localization accuracy than classical SVM. Additionally, we develop a new segmentation method by combining conditional random fields (CRF) with a cost-sensitive framework and show that our method further improves cost-sensitive SVM results by incorporating spatial information. We test SVM, cost-sensitive SVM, and the proposed cost-sensitive CRF on multispectral MRI datasets acquired from 21 biopsy-confirmed cancer patients.

Porcine skin tissue was topically exposed to alumina, ceria, and silica NPs using a modified Franz diffusion chamber and histologically prepared for imaging. EDFM allowed for rapid direct visualization of NPs, while hyperspectral mapping confirmed the composition of NPs throughout the tissue, based on positive matching of pixels to reference spectral libraries (RSLs). Relative quantitation of NPs was achieved based on calculating the percentage of mapped pixels per field of view (FOV). The greatest abundance of mapped NPs was found in the ceria-exposed group regardless of tissue layer, relative to the other groups. Fewer NPs were found in the dermis compared to the stratum corneum in both the aluminaand ceria-exposed groups.

We characterized probe specificity and bioactivity via immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometric analysis. In vitro data along with optical bioluminescence/fluorescence imaging were used to validate acquired MSOT in vivo images of probe biodistribution. Indocyanine green dye was used as a nonspecific control to define specificity of EGF-probe accumulation. Maximum accumulation occurred at 6 hours postinjection, demonstrating specific intratumoral probe uptake and minimal liver and kidney off-target accumulation. Optical bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging confirmed tumor-specific probe accumulation consistent with MSOT images. These studies demonstrate the utility of MSOT to obtain volumetric images of ligand probe biodistribution in vivo to detect orthotopic pancreatic tumor lesions through active targeting of the EGF receptor.

Methods: Eighteen patients with histopathological diagnosis of Ocular Surface Squamous Neoplasia (OSSN) were recruited. Their previously collected biopsy specimens of OSSN were reprocessed without staining to obtain auto fluorescence multispectral microscopy images. This technique involved a custom-built spectral imaging system with 38 spectral channels. Inter and intra-patient frameworks were deployed to automatically detect and delineate OSSN using machine learning methods. Different machine learning methods were evaluated, with K nearest neighbor and Support Vector Machine chosen as preferred classifiers for intra- and inter-patient frameworks, respectively. The performance of the technique was evaluated against a pathological assessment. Results: Quantitative analysis of the spectral images provided a strong multispectral signature of a relative difference between neoplastic and normal tissue both within each patient (at p < 0.0005) and between patients (at p < 0.001). Our fully automated diagnostic method based on machine learning produces maps of the relatively well circumscribed neoplastic-non neoplastic interface. Such maps can be rapidly generated in quasi-real time and used for intraoperative assessment. Generally, OSSN could be detected using multispectral analysis in all patients investigated here. The cancer margins detected by multispectral analysis were in close and reasonable agreement with the margins observed in the H&E sections in intra- and inter-patient classification, respectively. Conclusions: This study shows the feasibility of using multispectral auto-fluorescence imaging to detect and find the boundary of human OSSN. Fully automated analysis of multispectral images based on machine learning methods provides a promising diagnostic tool for OSSN which can be translated to future clinical applications.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "Quantitative gene analysis of methylation and expression (Q-GAME) in fresh or fixed cells and tissues", "abstract": "Epigenetic regulation of gene expression by DNA methylation is a central mechanism governing the silencing of tumor suppressor genes in many forms of cancer. Current methods have not proven optimal for the quantitative analysis of DNA methylation and corresponding in situ protein expression within cells in small specimens like skin biopsies.

Using this approach optimized for small samples, we can quantify minor alterations in gene methylation and protein expression using minimal amounts of tissue. Comparative studies of fresh and processed cells showed that our method is valid for DNA in both fresh and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens. We can measure the effects of DNA methylation inhibitors, administered in vitro or in vivo, on the promoter methylation and protein expression of selected genes in specific cells. This novel approach should prove useful for a wide variety of investigative and clinical applications in dermatology and other specialties where the collection of small, routinely processed biopsy specimens is common.

Normally, surgical tissues are examined by a pathologist to determine whether a full removal of the cancer was performed. However, these analyses are often imperfect due to time constraints, limitations in frozen sections, and tissue orientation challenges. Newer intraoperative imaging techniques have shown great promise for increasing both the accuracy and efficiency of this process while in the operating room. This review summarizes and analyzes the current state of the literature on intraoperative imaging in determining cancer margins in head and neck cancers. Surgical margin status is one of the strongest prognosticators in predicting patient outcomes in head and neck cancer, yet head and neck surgeons continue to face challenges in the accurate detection of these margins with the current standard of care. Novel intraoperative imaging modalities have demonstrated great promise for potentially increasing the accuracy and efficiency in surgical margin delineation. In this current study, we collated and analyzed various intraoperative imaging modalities utilized in head and neck cancer to evaluate their use in discriminating malignant from healthy tissues. The authors conducted a systematic database search through PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and EBSCOhost (CINAHL). Study screening and data extraction were performed and verified by the authors, and more studies were added through handsearching. Here, intraoperative imaging modalities are described, including optical coherence tomography, narrow band imaging, autofluorescence, and fluorescent-tagged probe techniques. Available sensitivities and specificities in delineating cancerous from healthy tissues ranged from 83.0% to 100.0% and 79.2% to 100.0%, respectively, across the different imaging modalities.

Stem cell-derived organoids follow a time course similar to species-specific organ gestation in vivo. However, heterogeneous tissue yields, and subjective tissue selection reduce the repeatability of organoid-based scientific experiments and clinical studies. To improve the quality control of organoids, we introduced a live imaging technique based on two-photon microscopy to non-invasively monitor and characterize retinal organoids' (RtOgs') long-term development. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) was used to monitor the metabolic trajectory, and hyperspectral imaging was applied to characterize structural and molecular changes. We further validated the live imaging experimental results with endpoint biological tests, including quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), single-cell RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemistry. With FLIM results, we analyzed the free/bound nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (f/b NADH) ratio of the imaged regions and found that there was a metabolic shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation. This shift occurred between the second and third months of differentiation. The total metabolic activity shifted slightly back toward glycolysis between the third and fourth months and stayed relatively stable between the fourth and sixth months. Consistency in organoid development among cell lines and production lots was examined. Molecular analysis showed that retinal progenitor genes were expressed in all groups between days 51 and 159. Photoreceptor gene expression emerged around the second month of differentiation, which corresponded to the shift in the f/b NADH ratio. RtOgs between 3 and 6 months of differentiation exhibited photoreceptor gene expression levels that were between the native human fetal and adult retina gene expression levels. The occurrence of cone opsin expression (OPN1 SW and OPN1 LW) indicated the maturation of photoreceptors in the fourth month of differentiation, which was consistent with the stabilized level of f/b NADH ratio starting from 4 months.

On the basis of a spectral focusing approach, we present a fast SRS hyperspectral imaging system using chirped femtosecond lasers to achieve rapid Raman spectra acquisition while retaining the full speed and image quality of narrowband SRS imaging. We demonstrate that quantitative concentration determination of cholesterol in the presence of interfering chemical species can be achieved with sensitivity down to 4 mM.

CLI is based on the detection of optical Cerenkov radiation generated by beta particles as they travel into the animal tissues with energy greater than Cerenkov threshold. The main goal of this work is the development of a novel optical image reconstruction method called multi spectral Cerenkov luminescence tomography (msCLT). The starting point of the msCLT reconstruction scheme is a set of 2D planar images acquired using several narrow bandpass filters. Because of the different tissues absorption at different wavelengths this provide distinctive information content that can be used for image reconstruction. More precisely the msCLT algorithm is based on a regularized iterative non-negative scheme in order to find the unknown source intensity solution, the theoretical Cerenkov emission spectrum was also included in the algorithm. In order to investigate the performances of the msCLT approach in vitro and in vivo imaging using (32)p-ATP were performed by using the IVIS 200 (Caliper, a PerkinElmer company). A set of spatial resolution measurements were performed using a small capillary source placed between several slices of chicken breast at different depths. The spatial resolution obtained from the msCLT reconstructed images of the capillary showed that the FWHM is 1.5 mm for a source placed at 6 mm depth. In order to investigate the in vivo performances of the msCLT reconstruction method, a control nude mice injected with 10 MBq of 32P-ATP were imaged. Whole body MRI was acquired to provide an anatomical localization of the Cerenkov emission. msCLT reconstructed images co-registered with MRI images showed that the Cerenkov emission regions matches well with anatomical regions, such as the brain, heart and abdomen.

Conventionally, because the photons detected at each pixel are distributed across as many as 200 energy channels, energy-selective images are characterised by low count-rates and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This means high X-ray exposures, long scan times and high doses are required to image unique spectral markers. Here, we achieve high quality energy-dispersive tomograms from low dose, noisy datasets using a dedicated iterative reconstruction algorithm. This exploits the spatial smoothness and inter-channel structural correlation in the spectral domain using two carefully chosen regularisation terms. For a multi-phase phantom, a reduction in scan time of 36 times is demonstrated. Spectral analysis methods including K-edge subtraction and absorption step-size fitting are evaluated for an ex vivo, single (iodine)-stained biological sample, where low chemical concentration and inhomogeneous distribution can affect soft tissue segmentation and visualisation.

Patients were selected after carefully reviewing their radiology reports to have either normal-by-MRI findings (25 patient subjects) or small focal pathology less than 6 mm in size (eight patient subjects). All subjects were MR imaged at 1.5 T with the mixed turbo spin echo pulse sequence. The soft tissues inside the cranial vault, termed intracranial matter (ICM), were segmented using a dual-clustering segmentation algorithm. ICM segments were further divided into six subsegments: bilateral anterior cerebral, posterior cerebral and cerebellar subsegments. T1, T2 and secular-T2 relaxation time histograms of all segments were generated and modeled with Gaussian functions. For each segment, the volumes of white matter, gray matter and cerebrospinal fluid were calculated from the T1 histograms. The age-related tendencies of three quantitative MRI parameters (T1, T2 and secular-T2) and the fractional tissue volumes showed four distinct periods of life, specifically a maturation period (0-2 years), a development period (2-20 years), an adulthood period (20-60 years) and a senescence period (60 years and older). For all ages, the anterior cerebral subsegment exhibited consistently longer gray matter T1s and shorter white matter T1s than the posterior cerebral and cerebellar subsegments. Volumetric age-related changes of the cerebellar subsegment were more gradual than in the cerebral subsegments.

Materials and Methods: Multiple MR imaging (MRI) sequences, including pre-contrast and post-contrast enhanced T1-weighted, T2-weighted, proton-density, and fast short inversion time inversion recovery (FSTIR), were acquired for six rabbits implanted with VX-2 adenocarcinoma. For each rabbit, DTR used the MR intensity characteristics of a known tumor site to highlight other areas suspicious for tumor. Three independent veterinary radiologists with extensive experience in animal MRI interpreted the images for tumor both without and with the results of DTR. The conventional and DTR-assisted interpretations were compared to pathology. Results: Using DTR, the radiologists found an average of 13.2% more true positive sites with a 10.3% reduction in false positives compared to unassisted interpretation. The improvement for the radiologists was statistically significant (McNemar's test, P = 0.0004). The agreement between radiologists using DTR was consistently higher than for their conventional interpretations (kappa statistic).

Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration is the current gold standard to diagnose thyroid cancers, but the results are inaccurate, leading to repeated biopsies and unnecessary surgeries. To reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies, we explored the use of multiparametric photoacoustic (PA) analysis in combination with the American Thyroid Association (ATA) Guideline (ATAP). In this study, we performed in vivo multispectral PA imaging on thyroid nodules from 52 patients, comprising 23 papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and 29 benign cases. From the multispectral PA data, we calculated hemoglobin oxygen saturation level in the nodule area, then classified the PTC and benign nodules with multiparametric analysis. Statistical analyses showed that this multiparametric analysis of multispectral PA responses could classify PTC nodules. Combining the photoacoustically indicated probability of PTC and the ATAP led to a new scoring method that achieved a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 93%. This study is the first multiparametric analysis of multispectral PA data of thyroid nodules with statistical significance. As a proof of concept, the results show that the proposed new ATAP scoring can help physicians examine thyroid nodules for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, thus reducing unnecessary biopsies.

A setup composed of a white light source and a hyperspectral or a standard RGB camera could be used to identify the functional areas. The choice of the best spectral configuration is still based on an empirical approach. We propose in this study a method to define the optimal spectral combinations of a commercial hyperspectral camera for the computation of hemodynamic and metabolic brain maps.

It has previously been applied in in vivo multiwavelength photoacoustic imaging studies to unmix the components representing individual chromophores by assuming that they are statistically independent. Numerically simulated and experimentally acquired two-dimensional images of tissue-mimicking phantoms are used to investigate the conditions required for ICA to give accurate estimates of the relative chromophore concentrations. A simple approximate fluence correction was applied to reduce but not completely remove the nonlinear fluence distortion, as might be possible in practice. The results show that ICA is robust against the residual effect of the partially corrected fluence distortion. ICA is shown to provide accurate unmixing of the chromophores when the absorption coefficient is within a certain range of values, where the upper absorption threshold is comparable to the absorption of blood. When the absorption is increased beyond these thresholds, ICA abruptly fails to unmix the chromophores accurately. The ICA approach was compared to a linear spectroscopic inversion (SI) with known absorption spectra. In cases where the mixing matrix with the specific absorption spectra is ill-conditioned, ICA is able to provide accurate unmixing when SI results in large errors. (C) The Authors.

We also investigated whether MSOT illumination can induce VTP, to implement a single-modality theranostic approach. Materials and Methods: Eight BalB/c mice were subcutaneously implanted with murine renal adenocarcinoma cells (RENCA) on the flank. Three weeks later VTP was performed (10 min continuous illumination at 753 nm following intravenous infusion) using WST11 or saline as control. Handheld MSOT images were collected prior to VTP administration and subsequently thereafter over the course of the first hour, at 24 and 48 h. Data collected were unmixed for blood oxygen saturation in tissue (SO2) based on the spectral signatures of deoxy-and oxygenated hemoglobin. Changes in oxygen saturation over time, relative to baseline, were examined by paired t-test for statistical significance (p < 0.05). In-vivo findings were corroborated by histological analyses of the tumor tissue. Results: MSOT is shown to prominently resolve changes in oxygen saturation in tumors within the first 20 min post WST11-VTP treatment. Within the first hour post-treatment, SO2 decreased by more than 60% over baseline (p < 0.05), whereas it remained unchanged (p > 0.1) in the sham-treated group. Moreover, unlike in the control group, SO2 in treated tumors further decreased over the course of 24 to 48 h post-treatment, concomitant with the propagation of profound central tumor necrosis present in histological analysis. We further show that pulsed MSOT illumination can activate WST11 as efficiently as the continuous wave irradiation employed for treatment. Conclusion: Handheld MSOT non-invasively monitored WST11-VTP effects based on the SO2 signal and detected blood saturation changes within the first 20 min post-treatment.

That the tumor microenvironment is highly heterogeneous with significant intratumor and intertumor variability presents a significant challenge in developing effective cancer therapies. Critical to understanding the role of the tumor microenvironment is the ability to dynamically quantify oxygen levels in the vasculature and tissue in order to elucidate the roles of oxygen supply and consumption, spatially and temporally. To this end, we describe the use of hyperspectral imaging to characterize hemoglobin absorption to quantify hemoglobin content and oxygen saturation, as well as dual emissive fluorescent/phosphorescent boron nanoparticles, which serve as ratiometric indicators of tissue oxygen tension. Applying these techniques to a window-chamber tumor model illustrates the role of fluctuations in hemoglobin saturation in driving changes in tissue oxygenation, the two being significantly correlated (r = 0.77). Finally, a green-fluorescence-protein reporter for hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) provides an endpoint for hypoxic stress in the tumor, which is used to demonstrate a significant association between tumor hypoxia dynamics and HIF-1 activity in an in vivo demonstration of the technique.

In vivo use of the system has been optimized, with particular emphasis on clearing blood from the optical pathway. A short acquisition time (5 seconds for a 20 mm long coronary segment) enabled data acquisition during a bolus saline solution injection through the 7 Fr catheter guide. The injection parameters were precisely controlled using a power injector and optimized to provide good image quality while limiting the bolus injection duration and volume (12 cc/s, 80 cc total volume). The ability of the system to acquire data in vivo was validated in healthy swine by imaging different sections of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary. A stent coated with fluorescent markers was placed in the LAD and imaged, demonstrating the ability of the system to discriminate in vivo different fluorescent features and structures from the vessel background fluorescence using spectral and lifetime information. Intensity en face images over the four bands of the instrument were available within seconds whereas lifetime images were computed in 2 minutes, providing efficient feedback during the procedure.

We demonstrated the use of hsSRS imaging in quantifying two major neutral lipids: cholesteryl ester and triacylglycerol in cells and tissues. Our imaging results revealed previously unknown changes of lipid composition associated with obesity and steatohepatitis. We further used stable-isotope labeling to trace the metabolic dynamics of fatty acids in live cells and live Caenorhabditis elegans with hsSRS imaging. We found that unsaturated fatty acid has preferential uptake into lipid storage while saturated fatty acid exhibits toxicity in hepatic cells. Simultaneous metabolic fingerprinting of deuterium-labeled saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in living C. elegans revealed that there is a lack of interaction between the two, unlike previously hypothesized. Our findings provide new approaches for metabolic tracing of neutral lipids and their precursors in living cells and organisms, and could potentially serve as a general approach for metabolic fingerprinting of other metabolites.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "An Assessment of Photoacoustic and Photon Counting Multispectral x-Ray Imaging Techniques for Imaging Gold Nanorods in vivo as Part of Predicting Dose Enhancing Effects", "abstract": "Radiotherapy, whilst useful in the treatment of many cancers, suffers from the drawback of unavoidably delivering radiation doses to healthy tissue. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been the subject of much interest as they are able to generate a local dose enhancing effect (DEE), allowing lower intensity beams to achieve a given effect, sparing healthy tissue. It is important that GNP distributions can be ascertained before radiotherapy begins so that accurate treatment plans can be made. Two imaging modalities that show great promise in being able to identify these GNPs in vivo without delivering excessive DEEs are photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photon counting multi-spectral x-ray imaging (x-CSI). This work forms part of a larger project to assess the feasibility of using x-CSI and PAI to predict DEEs during radiotherapy planning. This work assessed the degradation of gold nanorods (GNRs) in a photoacoustic system sold by iThera, specifically comparing the protective effects against degradation afforded by a silica coating as opposed to GNR PEGylation. This coating is also hoped to prevent spectral broadening when the GNRs are endocytosed, allowing PAI to confirm uptake of GNRs by cells. With regards x-CSI, this work uses a combination of Monte Carlo and Finite Element modelling techniques to realistically model cylindrical phantoms of high-Z materials in order to demonstrate the potential improvements in imaging contrast that x-CSI can produce over traditional energy integrated x-ray imaging techniques.

The current standard for PCa diagnosis remains histopathology. Nonetheless, for the differentiation between Gleason score 6 (low-risk PCa), which can be left without treatment, and Gleason score 7 (high-risk PCa), which requires active treatment, the inter-observer discordance can be up to 40%. Our previous study reveals that cholesteryl ester (CE) accumulation induced by PI3K/AKT activation underlies human PCa aggressiveness. However, Raman spectromicroscopy used in this study could only provide compositional information of certain lipid droplets (LDs) selected by the observer, which overlooked cell-to-cell variation and hindered translation to accurate automated diagnosis. Here, we demonstrated quantitative mapping of CE level in human prostate tissues using hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy that renders compositional information for every pixel in the image. Specifically, hundreds of SRS images at Raman shift between 1620-1800 cm-1 were taken, and multivariate curve resolution algorism was used to retrieve concentration images of acyl C=C bond, sterol C=C bond, and ester C=O bond. Given that the ratio between images of sterol C=C and ester C=O (sterol C=C/C=O) is nonlinearly proportional to CE percentage out of total lipid, we were able to quantitatively map CE level. Our data showed that CE level was significantly greater in high Gleason grade compared to low Gleason grade, and could be a factor that significantly contributed to cancer recurrence.

Tomographic acquisition with ultrasound linear arrays offers an easy implementation of single-side access, parallelized, and high-frequency detection, but usually comes with an image quality impaired by the directionality of the detectors. Indeed, a simple translation of the array perpendicular to its median imaging plane is often used, but results both in a poor resolution in the translation direction and strong limited-view artifacts. To improve the spatial resolution and the visibility of complex structures while retaining a planar detection geometry, we introduce, in this paper, a rotate-translate scanning scheme and investigate the performance of a scanner implemented at 15 MHz center frequency.

Furthermore, the mechanisms whereby the cell-based RMTs ameliorate injury are ill-defined. For instance, it is not always clear if the cells directly replace damaged renal tissue, or whether paracrine effects are more important. Knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of cell therapies is crucial because it could lead to the development of safer and more effective RMTs in the future. To address these questions, novel in vivo imaging strategies are needed to monitor the biodistribution of cell-based RMTs and evaluate their beneficial effects on host tissues and organs, as well as any potential adverse effects.

A hyperspectral imaging system in line scan mode was used to acquire spatially resolved diffuse reflectance images from the samples of apple (three varieties), peach, pear, kiwifruit, plum, Cucumber, zucchini squash, and tomato (at three ripeness stages) over the spectral range of 500-1000 nm. The absorption and reduced scattering coefficients of the samples were determined from the spatially resolved scattering profiles usinginverse algorithms for a diffusion theory model. Spectra of the absorption coefficient were featured by major pigments (chlorophyll, anthocyanin, and carotenoid) and water in the samples, whereas spectra of the reduced scattering coefficient generally decreased with the increase of wavelength. Values of the absorption and reduced scattering coefficients varied greatly among the test samples. Large differences in the absorption spectra were observed for the tomatoes of three ripeness stages (green, pink, and red), and their ripeness was correctly classified using the ratio of the absorption coefficient at 675 nm (for chlorophyll) to that at 535 nm (for anthocyanin). Values of the reduced scattering coefficient positively correlated with the firmness of tomatoes at individual wavelengths of 500-1000 nm, with the maximum correlation of 0.66 being obtained at 790 nm. Light penetration depths, defined as the depths at which the incident light was reduced by 99%, were estimated to be between 0.97 and 6.52 cm for the fruit and vegetable samples over the wavelength range of 500-1000 nm; they were influenced by major pigments in the plant tissue.

The Au-IO NP formed in the presence of silver-primed Au-IO were stabilized by using partially thiolated MPEG5-gPLL graft copolymer carrying residual amino groups.

Jiao Li (Tianjin University, China), Vasilis Ntziachristos (Technical University of Munich, Germany), and colleagues have designed a multispectral optoacoustic mesoscope (MSOM) that illuminates millimetre-sized tumours with laser light of various wavelengths, and detects the ultrasound waves generated by internal absorbers, such as haemoglobin, or external nanoparticle probes. By reconstructing the ultrasound signals over multiple frequencies, the team produced 3D images of features that included the vascular network of a tumour with micrometre-scale detail. Experiments with live mice demonstrated that specific tumours could be identified through differences in spatial patterns, such as altered oxygen levels between tumour cores and peripheries. The study highlights the power of MSOM as a tool for preclinical cancer studies. The characteristics of tumour development and metastasis relate not only to genomic heterogeneity but also to spatial heterogeneity, associated with variations in the intratumoural arrangement of cell populations, vascular morphology and oxygen and nutrient supply. While optical (photonic) microscopy is commonly employed to visualize the tumour microenvironment, it assesses only a few hundred cubic microns of tissue. Therefore, it is not suitable for investigating biological processes at the level of the entire tumour, which can be at least four orders of magnitude larger. In this study, we aimed to extend optical visualization and resolve spatial heterogeneity throughout the entire tumour volume. We developed an optoacoustic (photoacoustic) mesoscope adapted to solid tumour imaging and, in a pilot study, offer the first insights into cancer optical contrast heterogeneity in vivo at an unprecedented resolution of <50 mu m throughout the entire tumour mass.

Missed lesions are often flat and inconspicuous in color. A prototype ultraviolet spectral imager measuring autofluorescence (AF) and reflectance has been developed and applied in a study of 21 fresh human colon surgical specimens. Six excitation wavelengths from 280 to 440 nm and formulaic ratio imaging were utilized to increase lesion contrast and cause neoplasms to appear bright compared to normal tissue. It was found that in the subset of lesions which were most difficult to visualize in standard color photographs [low contrast lesions, (LCLs)] a ratio image (F340/F440) of AF images excited at 340 and 440 nm produced extraordinary images and was effective in about 70% of these difficult cases. Contrast may be due to increased levels of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, increased hemoglobin absorption, and reduced signal from submucosal collagen. A second successful ratio image (R480/R555) combined two reflectance images to produce exceptional images especially in particular LCLs where F340/F440 was ineffective.

All the components are mounted fulfilling restrictions from surgical environments, as shown in the accompanying video recorded at the operating room. An in-vivo human brain hyperspectral image data base, obtained at the University Hospital Doctor Negrin in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, has been employed as input to different supervised classification algorithms (SVM, RF, NN) and to a spatial-spectral filtering stage (SVM-KNN).

Structural guidance provided by an anatomical imaging modality enhances the DOT imaging substantially. Here, we propose a computed tomography (CT) guided multispectral DOT imaging system for breast cancer detection. To validate its feasibility, we have built a prototype DOT imaging system which consists of a laser at wavelengths of 650 and an electron multiplying charge coupled device (EMCCD) camera. We have validated the CT guided DOT reconstruction algorithms with numerical simulations and phantom experiments, in which different imaging setup parameters, such as projection number of measurements, the width of measurement patch, have been investigated. Our results indicate that an EMCCD camera with air cooling is good enough for the transmission mode DOT imaging. We have also found that measurements at six projections are sufficient for DOT to reconstruct the optical targets with 4 times absorption contrast when the CT guidance is applied.

The available imaging techniques are limited in their ability for deep tissue in vivo imaging of hair follicles and lipid-rich sebaceous glands in their entirety without biopsy.

Therefore, the development of a safe, mobile, non-invasive, optical method that would be easy to perform, precise and low-cost, but also would offer an accurate assessment of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) both in lean and in obese persons is required. Thereof, the diffuse optical spectroscopy is advantageous over the aforementioned techniques. A prototype device using an optical method for measurement of the SAT thickness in vivo has been developed. The probe contained multiple LEDs (660nm) distributed at various distances from the photo-detector which allow different light penetration depths into the subcutaneous tissue. The differences of the reflected light intensities were used to create a non-linear model, and the computed values were compared with the corresponding thicknesses of SAT, assessed by B-mode ultrasonography.

In this review, we evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of optical spectroscopy technologies (fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy) for the in vivo diagnosis of cervical neoplasia using both point probe and multispectral imaging approaches. Methods. We searched electronic databases using the following terms: cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, squamous intraepithelial lesion, and spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, or reflectance spectroscopy. We included studies that evaluated fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy devices for in vivo diagnosis, compared those results with biopsy results, and reported on the sensitivity and specificity of the devices tested. Results. Twenty-six studies, including seven phase 11 trials and one randomized clinical trial, met our acceptability criteria. We found several important differences across the studies including device approach (multispectral versus point probe), study population, disease classification system, and disease threshold. This heterogeneity prevented formal combination of sensitivity and specificity results. Conclusion. Optical spectroscopy has similar performance to colposcopy and may help localize lesions and therefore be an effective adjunct to colposcopy. Reports on the diagnostic accuracy of these devices should use common thresholds for the construction of receiver operating characteristic curves to enable comparisons with standard technologies and facilitate their adoption. Optical spectroscopy has also been identified for possible use as ASCUS triage and primary screening, yet neither has been sufficiently evaluated to warrant a conclusion as to their suitability in this role.

In addition, photoacoustic imaging allows for imaging of vascularization based on the intrinsic contrast of hemoglobin. In this study, we investigated photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) as a tool for longitudinal monitoring of an implanted hydrogel in a small animal model.

Quantitative volume analysis was used to evaluate the in vivo degradation kinetics of the implants which deviated slightly from in vitro predictions.

Parameters that might be controlled or tuned to assess the performance of qPAI algorithms were studied: broadband acoustic properties, multiwavelength optical properties with added absorbers and scatterers, and photoacoustic efficiency. The optical and acoustic properties of PVCP can be tuned to be broadly representative of soft tissue. The Gruneisen parameter is larger than expected in tissue, which is an advantage as it increases the signal-to-noise ratio of the photoacoustic measurements.

Employing a method to extract additional spectral bands from RGB components (that we named crosschannels), we designed a handheld SI-DI device to account for these pigments, using low-cost, consumer-grade components for its implementation and characterization. Aim: With only three broad spectral bands (red, green, blue, or RGB), consumer-grade devices are often too limited. We present a methodology to increase the number of spectral bands in SI-DI devices that use RGB components without hardware modification. Approach: We developed a compact low-cost RGB spectral imager using a color CMOS camera and LED-based mini projector. The components' spectral properties were characterized and additional cross-channel bands were calculated. An alternative characterization procedure was also developed that makes use of low-cost equipment, and its results were compared. The device performance was evaluated by measurements on tissue-simulating optical phantoms and in-vivo tissue. The measurements were compared with another quantitative spectroscopy method: spatial frequency domain spectroscopy (SFDS). Results: Out of six possible cross-channel bands, two were evaluated to be suitable for our application and were fully characterized (520 +/- 20 nm; 556 +/- 18 nm). The other four cross-channels presented a too low signal-to-noise ratio for this implementation. In estimating the optical properties of optical phantoms, the SFDI data have a strong linear correlation with the SFDS data (R-2 = 0.987, RMSE = 0.006 for mu(a), R-2 = 0.994, RMSE = 0.078 for it mu(s)'). Conclusions: We extracted two additional spectral bands from a commercial RGB system at no cost. There was good agreement between our device and the research-grade SFDS system.

Different types of light sources can be used for the imaging. Design of laser-based illuminators is more complicated and, consequently, they are more expensive than LED-based illuminators. On the other hand, spectral line illumination has the advantage of less complicated calculations, since only the discrete maximum wavelengths need to be considered. Spectral band and spectral line approaches for multispectral skin diagnostics have not been compared so far. This can help to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of both approaches. Aim: To compare two specific illumination modalities-spectral band and spectral line illumination-from the point of performance for mapping of in vivo skin chromophores. Approach: Three spectral images of the same skin malformations were captured by a smartphone RGB camera with two different add-on illuminators comprising LED emitters and laser emitters, respectively. Five types of benign skin neoplasms were included in our study. Concentrations of skin melanin, oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin at image pixel groups were calculated using the Beer-Lambert law. Results: Skin chromophore maps and statistical analysis of mean concentrations' changes in the neoplasms compared to the surrounding skin are presented and discussed. The data of the laser emitters led to significantly higher (similar to 10 times) increase of the oxy-hemoglobin values in vascular neoplasms and much lower deoxy-hemoglobin values, if compared to the data obtained by the LED emitters. Conclusions: Analysis of the obtained chromophore distribution maps and concentration variations in neoplasms led to conclusion that the spectral line illumination approach is more appropriate for this application. Considering only the peak wavelengths of illumination spectral bands leads to essentially different results if compared to those obtained by spectral line illumination and may cause misinterpretations in the clinical assessment of skin neoplasms.

The wavelength dependence of tissue optical properties within the 680-850 nm band can be exploited for emitted light by measuring fluorescent data via multispectral approaches and incorporating the spectral dependence of these optical properties into the OFT inverse problem-that of reconstructing underlying 3D fluorescent probe distributions from optical data collected on the animal surface. However, in the aforementioned spectral band, due to only small variations in the tissue optical properties, multispectral emission data, though superior for image reconstruction compared to achromatic data, tend to be somewhat redundant. A different spectral approach for OFT is to capitalize on the larger variations in the optical properties of tissue for excitation photons than for the emission photons by using excitation at multiple wavelengths as a means of decoding source depth in tissue. The full potential of spectral approaches in OFT can be realized by a synergistic combination of these two approaches, that is, exciting the underlying fluorescent probe at multiple wavelengths and measuring emission data multispectrally. In this paper, we describe a method that incorporates both excitation and emission spectral information into the OFT inverse problem. We describe a linear algebraic formulation of the multiple wavelength illumination-multispectral detection forward model for OFT and compare it to models that use only excitation at multiple wavelengths or those that use only multispectral detection techniques. This study is carried out in a realistic inhomogeneous mouse atlas using singular value decomposition and analysis of reconstructed spatial resolution versus noise. For simplicity, quantitative results have been shown for one representative fluorescent probe (Alexa 700(R)) and effects due to tissue autofluorescence have not been taken into account.

AcousticX is a linear array ultrasound transducer (128 elements, 10 MHz)-based system in which LED arrays (selectable wavelengths, pulse repetition frequency: 4 kHz, pulse width: tunable from 40 - 100 ns) are fixed on both sides of the transducer to illuminate the tissue for photoacoustic imaging. The ultrasound/photoacoustic data from all 128 elements can be simultaneously acquired, processed and displayed. We already demonstrated our system's capability to perform photoacoustic/ultrasound imaging for dynamic imaging of the tissue at a frame rate of 10 Hz (for example to visualize the pulsation of arteries in vivo in human subjects). In this work, we present the development of a new high-speed imaging mode in AcousticX. In this mode, instead of toggling between ultrasound and photoacoustic measurements, it is possible to continuously acquire only photoacoustic data for 1.5 seconds with a time interval of 1 ms. With this improvement, we can record photoacoustic signals from the whole aperture (38 mm) at fast rate and can be reviewed later at different speeds for analyzing dynamic changes in the photoacoustic signals. We believe that AcousticX with this new high-speed mode opens up a feasible technical path for multiple dynamic studies, for example one which focus on imaging the response of voltage sensitive dyes. We envisage to improve the acquisition speed further in future for exploring ultra-high-speed applications.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "Multispectral imaging technique for skin grafts' functional state assessment", "abstract": "The development of express method for assessing the state of skin graft by the spectroscopic properties of tissue components involved in the healing of the affected skin or healing of skin grafts was carried out in present work.

We employed spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) to characterize the changes in optical properties of tissue during wound healing progression in a porcine model of split-thickness skin grafts and also in a model of burn wound healing with no graft intervention. Changes in the reduced scattering coefficient measured using SFDI correlated with structural changes reported by histology of biopsies taken concurrently. SFDI was able to measure spatial inhomogeneity in the wounds and predicted heterogeneous healing. In addition, we were able to visualize differences in healing rate, depending on whether a wound was debrided and grafted, versus not debrided and left to heal without intervention apart from topical burn wound care. Changes in the concentration of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin were also quantified, giving insight into hemodynamic changes during healing. (C) The Authors.

The mechanical properties of a pregnant woman's cervix change dramatically during gestation due to a remodeling of its microstructure, necessary for delivery. However, external factors can accelerate this process and lead to prematurity, the primary cause of perinatal mortality worldwide, due to the inefficiency of existing diagnostic methods. This study shows that polarized light is a powerful tool to probe the cervical microstructure during pregnancy. A wide-field multispectral polarimetric imaging system was fabricated to explore in vivo the cervix of full-term pregnant women. The polarimetric properties of the cervix change significantly with pregnancy progression. In particular, a set of several depolarization parameters (intrinsic and extrinsic) showed a strong linear correlation with gestational age in the red part of the visible spectral range. This trend can be attributed, among other things, to a decrease in collagen density and an increase in hydration of cervical connective tissue. Wide field depolarization imaging is a very promising tool for rapid and non-invasive analysis of cervical tissue in vivo to monitor the steady progression of pregnancy, providing the practitioner with useful information to improve the detection of preterm birth.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "Evaluation of a novel laparoscopic camera for characterization of renal ischemia in a porcine model using digital light processing (DLP) hyperspectral imaging", "abstract": "Introduction: Digital light processing hyperspectral imaging (DLP (R) HSI) was adapted for use during laparoscopic surgery by coupling a conventional laparoscopic light guide with a DLP-based Agile Light source (OL 490, Optronic Laboratories, Orlando, FL), incorporating a 0(0) laparoscope, and a customized digital CCD camera (DVC, Austin, TX). The system was used to characterize renal ischemia in a porcine model. Methods: Laparoscopic DLP (R) HSI was performed in 2 groups of uni-nephric adult pigs that were each subjected to 90 minutes of warm ischemia. Group 1 (n=5) received tadalafil to mitigate ischemia/reperfusion injury while Group 2 (n=4) received no treatment. HSI-derived percentage of oxygenated hemoglobin (%HbO(2)) was plotted against time before, during and after ischemia. Serum creatinine measured pre-ischemia (D0), and on days 1, 3 and 7 post-ischemia, was correlated with %HbO(2) using the Spearman's rank test. %HbO(2) was compared for the groups using the Student's t-test. Results: Mean baseline and nadir %HbO(2) for tadalafil vs. controls was 74% vs. 75% and 50% vs. 54% respectively; values did not significantly differ between the groups at any sampled time point. D0 creatinine was significantly lower for the tadalafil group, but creatinine at all other time points was similar between the groups. Baseline and nadir %HbO(2) significantly correlated with D7 and D0 creatinine respectively in the tadalafil group alone.

To accomplish our aim, we constructed an imaging system consisting of a broad-band Tungsten light source; 1,200-, 1,650-, 1,940-, and 2,250-nm wavelength filters; and a specialized SWIR camera. We initially used agar slabs to provide a baseline spectrum for SWIR light imaging and demonstrated the differential absorbance at the multiple wavelengths, with 1,940 nm being the highest absorbed wavelength. These spectral bands were then demonstrated to detect levels of moisture in inorganic and in vivo mice models. The multiwavelength SWIR imaging approach was used to diagnose depth of burns using an in vivo porcine burn model. Healthy and injured skin regions were imaged 72 hours after short (20 seconds) and long (60 seconds) burn application, and biopsies were extracted from those regions for histologic analysis. Burn depth analysis based on collagen coagulation histology confirmed the formation of superficial and deep burns.

Fast-MSOT was based on unique single-frame-per-pulse (SFPP) image acquisition employed to improve the accuracy of spectral differentiation over using a small number of wavelengths. Breast tissue was illuminated at the 700-970 nm spectral range over 0.56 seconds total scan time. MSOT data were guided by ultrasonography and X-ray mammography or MRI. Results: The extended spectral range allowed the computation of oxygenated hemoglobin (HBO2), deoxygenated hemoglobin (HB), total blood volume (TBV), lipid, and water contributions, allowing first insights into in vivo high-resolution breast tissue MSOT cancer patterns. TBV and Hb/HBO2 images resolved marked differences between cancer and control tissue, manifested as a vessel-rich tumor periphery with highly heterogeneous spatial appearance compared with healthy tissue. We observe significant TBV variations between different tumors and between tumors over healthy tissues. Water and fat lipid layers appear disrupted in cancer versus healthy tissue; however, offer weaker contrast compared with TBV images.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of a spectrophotometric system to mimic such a decision. The study involved 1794 consecutively recruited patients with 1966 doubtful cutaneous pigmented lesions excised for histopathological diagnosis and 348 patients with 1940 non- excised lesions because clinically reassuring. Images of all these lesions were acquired in vivo with a multispectral imaging system. The data set was randomly divided into a train (802 reassuring and 1003 excision- needing lesions, including 139 melanomas), a verify (464 reassuring and 439 excision-needing lesions, including 72 melanomas) and a test set (674 reassuring and 524 excision- needing lesions, including 76 melanomas). An artificial neural network (ANN(1)) was set up to perform the classification of the lesions as excision- needing or reassuring, according to the expert clinicians' decision on how to manage each examined lesion. In the independent test set, the system was able to emulate the clinicians with a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 80%.

Perfusion of Zone III relative to Zone I was similar between SLRP and SMRP flaps (97.4% vs. 97.9%, respectively). These differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05). Perfusion to the lateral edge of the flap was slightly greater for SLRP flaps compared SMRP flaps (92.1% vs. 89.5%, respectively). SMRP flaps had superior perfusion travelling inferiorly compared to SLRP flaps (88.8% vs. 83.9%, respectively).

The multispectral Interlaced Sparse Sampling PAT, or ISS-PAT, is a previously proposed PAT imaging method that offered high quality images with much sparser transducer angular coverage. Although it provides superior imaging performance, the original ISS-PAT method suffered from a heavy computation burden, which hinders its practical application. Methods: Here, we propose a new regularization scheme based on the directional total variation (dTV) for ISS-PAT. This method efficiently imposes the structural information by considering both the edge position and direction information of the anatomical prior image in ISS-PAT. It does not require image segmentation, and can be conveniently solved by a modified alternating direction of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Results: We perform simulation, tissue mimicking phantom and in vivo small animal experiments to evaluate the proposed scheme. The reconstructed PAT images showed image quality and spectral unmixing accuracy close to those obtained by non-local means based ISS-PAT, but with much shorter image reconstruction time. For a 1/6 sparse sampling rate, the average efficiency improvement is nearly 16-folds. Conclusions: The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the dTV regularization scheme for ISS-PAT.

HsSRS in both fingerprint (800-1800 cm(-1)) and high-wavenumber (2800-3600 cm(-1)) regions allows us to discriminate different constituents with tiny difference in the Raman spectra. The increase of proteins and reduction of lipids could be observed with the progress of colonic cancer. SHG shows the distribution of collagen, which is found to aggregate for adenocarcinoma. TPEF provides the cell morphological and can reflect the damage inside glands caused by the diseases. THG shows the increase of optical heterogeneity related to cancer process.

The positrons emitted by F-18-FDG, travelling into tissues faster than the speed of light in the same medium, are responsible for Cerenkov radiation (CR) emission which is prevalently in the visible range. The purpose of this study is to show that CR escaping from tumour tissues of small living animals injected with F-18-FDG can be detected with optical imaging (OI) techniques using a commercial optical instrument equipped with charge-coupled detectors (CCD). The theory behind the Cerenkov light emission and the source depth measurements using CR is first presented. Mice injected with F-18-FDG or saline solution underwent dynamic OI acquisition and a comparison between images was performed. Multispectral analysis of the radiation was used to estimate the depth of the source of Cerenkov light. Small animal PET images were also acquired in order to compare the F-18-FDG bio-distribution measured using OI and PET scanner. Cerenkov in vivo whole-body images of tumour-bearing mice and the measurements of the emission spectrum (560-660 nm range) are presented. Brain, kidneys and tumour were identified as a source of visible light in the animal body: the tissue time-activity curves reflected the physiological accumulation of F-18-FDG in these organs. The identification is confirmed by the comparison between CR and F-18-FDG images. These results will allow the use of conventional OI devices for the in vivo study of glucose metabolism in cancer and the assessment, for example, of anti-cancer drugs. Moreover, this demonstrates that F-18-FDG can be employed as it is a bimodal tracer for PET and OI techniques.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "Fluorescence molecular tomography resolves protease activity in vivo", "abstract": "Systematic efforts are under way to develop novel technologies that would allow molecular sensing in intact organisms in vivo.

The development of a safe, mobile, non-invasive method that would be easy to perform, and low-cost, but also would offer an accurate assessment of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) both in lean and in obese persons is required. A prototype device using an optical method for measurement of the SAT in vivo has been developed, it contains multiple LEDs with four wavelengths (660nm, 780nm, 870nm, 940nm) distributed at various distances from the photodetector which allow different light penetration depths into the subcutaneous tissue. Five young healthy female students participated in the study; the measurements were performed on three body sites: calf, upper and lower abdomen. The backscattered light acquired with the prototype was compared to SAT measured with high resolution ultrasound imaging. The coefficient of variation indicated high reliability of the measurements. Statistically significant (from r=0.81 to r=0.95; p<0.05) correlation between intensity of backscattered light and SAT thicknesses for all four wavelength was observed, especially at source-detector distance 25mm.

By taking advantage of optical and ultrasound imaging, PAI probes SLNs non-invasively with methylene blue (MB) in both live animals and breast cancer patients. However, these PAI systems have limitations for widespread use in clinics and commercial marketplaces because the lasers used by the PAI systems, e.g., tunable liquid dye laser systems and optical parametric oscillator (OPO) lasers, are bulky in size, not economical, and use risky flammable and toxic liquid dyes. To overcome these limitations, we are proposing a novel dual-modal photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging system based on a solid-state dye laser (SD-PAUSI), which is compact, convenient, and carries far less risk of flammability and toxicity. Using a solid-state dye handpiece that generates 650-nm wavelength, we successfully imaged the MB tube positioned deeply (similar to 3.9 cm) in chicken breast tissue. The SLNs were also photoacoustically detected in the in vivo rats beneath a 2.2-cm-thick layer of chicken breast, which is deeper than the typical depth of SLNs in humans (1.2 +/- 0.5 cm).

Each lesion was imaged in vivo by a multispectral imaging system. The system operates at wavelengths between 483 and 950 nm by acquiring 15 images at equally spaced wavelength intervals. From the images, different lesion descriptors were extracted related to the colour distribution and morphology of the lesions. Data reduction techniques were applied before setting up a neural network classifier designed to perform automated diagnosis. The data set was randomly divided into three sets: train (696 lesions, including 90 melanomas) and verify (348 lesions, including 53 melanomas) for the instruction of a proper neural network, and an independent test set (347 lesions, including 41 melanomas). The neural network was able to discriminate between melanomas and non-melanoma lesions with a sensitivity of 80.4% and a specificity of 75.6% in the 1391 histologized cases data set. No major variations were found in classification scores when train, verify and test subsets were separately evaluated. Following receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the resulting area under the curve was 0.85. No significant differences were found among areas under train, verify and test set curves, supporting the good network ability to generalize for new cases. In addition, specificity and area under ROC curve increased up to 90% and 0.90, respectively, when the additional set of 1022 lesions without histology was added to the test set.

Due to the br,oad absorption in the near-infrared range, Au-Fe2C JNPs showed a significant photothermal effect with a 30.2% calculated photothermal transduction efficiency under 808 nm laser irradiation in vitro. Owing to their excellent optical and magnetic properties, Au-Fe2C JNPs were demonstrated to be advantageous agents for triple-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/multispectral photoacoustic tomography (MSOT)/computed tomography (CT) both in vitro and in vivo. We found that Au-Fe2C JNPs conjugated with the affibody (Au-Fe2C Z(HER2,342)) have more accumulation and deeper penetration in tumor sites than nontargeting JNPs (Au-Fe2C PEG) in vivo.

While potential applications include the early detection of tumors below clinical thresholds set by current technology, the lack of tumor-specific contrast agents limits the use of MSOT imaging. Therefore, we constructed highly stable nano-contrast agents by coating gold nanorods (GNRs) with either polyacrylic acid (PAA) or aminefunctionalized mesoporous silica (MS). Syndecan-1, which has been shown to target insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1-R) (upregulated in pancreatic tumors), was conjugated on the surface of PAA-coated GNRs (PAA-GNRs) or MS-coated GNRs (MS-GNRs) to create tumor-targeted nanoparticles. In vitro, tumor targeting of nanoparticles was assessed with flow cytometry. In S2VP10L cells (positive for IGF1-R), the syndecan-1 MS-GNRs (Syndecan-MS-GNRs) demonstrated an increase in OA signal, 10x, compared to syndecan-1 PAAGNRs (Syndecan-PAA-GNRs).

This technology features a light-emitting reaction between enzymes (luciferases) and small molecule substrates (luciferins). Photons produced from luciferase-luciferin reactions can penetrate through heterogeneous tissue, enabling readouts of physiological processes. Dozens of bioluminescent probes are now available and many are routinely used to monitor cell proliferation, migration, and gene expression patterns in vivo. Despite the ubiquity of bioluminescence, traditional applications have been largely limited to imaging one biological feature at a time. Only a handful of luciferase-luciferin pairs can be easily used in tandem, and most are poorly resolved in living animals. Efforts to develop spectrally distinct reporters have been successful, but multispectral imaging in large organisms remains a formidable challenge due to interference from surrounding tissue. Consequently, a lack of well-resolved probes has precluded multicomponent tracking. An expanded collection of bioluminescent probes would provide insight into processes where multiple cell types drive physiological tasks, including immune function and organ development. We aimed to expand the bioluminescent toolkit by developing substrate-resolved imaging agents. The goal was to generate multiple orthogonal (i.e., noncross-reactive) luciferases that are responsive to unique scaffolds and could be used concurrently in living animals. We adopted a parallel engineering approach to genetically modify luciferases to accept chemically modified luciferins. When the mutants and analogs are combined, light is produced only when complementary enzyme-substrate partners interact. Thus, the pairs can be distinguished based on substrate selectivity, regardless of the color of light emitted. Sequential administration of the luciferins enables the unique luciferases to be illuminated (and thus resolved) within complex environments, including whole organisms. This Account describes our efforts to develop orthogonal bioluminescent probes, crafting custom luciferases (or biological flashlights) that can selectively process luciferin analogs (or batteries) to produce light. In the first section, we describe synthetic methods that were key to accessing diverse luciferin architectures. The second section focuses on identifying complementary luciferase enzymes via a combination of mutagenesis and screening. To expedite the search for orthogonal enzymes and substrates, we developed a computational algorithm to sift through large data sets. The third section features examples of the parallel engineering approach. We identified orthogonal enzyme-substrate pairs comprising two different classes of luciferins. The probes were vetted both in cells and whole organisms. This expanded collection of imaging agents is applicable to studies of immune function and other multicomponent processes.

Eighty per cent of BCCs are located on the head and neck area. Clinically ill-defined BCCs often represent histologically aggressive subtypes, and they can have subtle subclinical extensions leading to recurrence and the need for re-excisions. Objectives The aim of this pilot study was to test the feasibility of a hyperspectral imaging system (HIS) in vivo in delineating the preoperatively lateral margins of ill-defined BCCs on the head and neck area. Methods Ill-defined BCCs were assessed clinically with a dermatoscope, photographed and imaged with HIS. This was followed by surgical procedures where the BCCs were excised at the clinical border and the marginal strip separately. HIS, with a 12-cm(2) field of view and fast data processing, records a hyperspectral graph for every pixel in the imaged area, thus creating a data cube. With automated computational modelling, the spectral data are converted into localization maps showing the tumour borders. Interpretation of these maps was compared to the histologically verified tumour borders. Results Sixteen BCCs were included. Of these cases, 10 of 16 were the aggressive subtype of BCC and 6 of 16 were nodular, superficial or a mixed type. HIS delineated the lesions more accurately in 12 of 16 of the BCCs compared to the clinical evaluation (4 of 16 wider and 8 of 16 smaller by HIS). In 2 of 16 cases, the HIS-delineated lesion was wider without histopathological confirmation. In 2 of 16 cases, HIS did not detect the histopathologically confirmed subclinical extension.

To investigate the potential of the NP-based strategies for colon-specific delivery, two formulations, free Eudragit (R) NPs and enteric-coated NP-loaded chitosan hypromellose microcapsules (MCs) were fluorescently-labelled and their tissue distribution in mice after oral administration was monitored by multispectral small animal imaging. The free NPs showed a shorter transit time throughout the mouse digestive tract than the MCs, with extensive excretion of NPs in faeces at 5 h. Conversely, the MCs showed complete NP release in the lower region of the mouse small intestine at 8 h post-administration. Overall, the encapsulation of NPs in MCs resulted in a higher colonic NP intensity from 8 h to 24 h post-administration compared to the free NPs, due to a NP 'guarding' effect of MCs during their transit along mouse gastrointestinal tract which decreased NP excretion in faeces. These imaging data revealed that this widely-utilised colon-targeting MC formulation lacked site-precision for releasing its NP load in the colon, but the increased residence time of the NPs in the lower gastrointestinal tract suggests that it is still useful for localised release of chemotherapeutics, compared to NP administration alone. In addition, both formulations resided in the stomach of mice at considerable concentrations over 24 h. Thus, adhesion of NP- or MC-based oral delivery systems to gastric mucosa may be problematic for colon-specific delivery of the cargo to the colon and should be carefully investigated for a full evaluation of particulate delivery systems.

In recent years, wavelengths in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window (1000 to 1700 nm) have been increasingly explored due to its potential for preclinical and clinical applications. In contrast to the conventional PA imaging in the visible (400 to 700 nm) and the first NIR-I (700 to 1000 nm) window, PA imaging in the NIR-II window offers numerous advantages, including high spatial resolution, deeper penetration depth, reduced optical absorption, and tissue scattering. Moreover, the second window allows a fivefold higher light excitation energy density compared to the visible window for enhancing the imaging depth significantly. We highlight the importance of the second window for PA imaging and discuss the various NIR-II PA imaging systems and contrast agents with strong absorption in the NIR-II spectral region.

In this study, we evaluated multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) as an imaging modality to detect pancreatic adenocarcinoma in an orthotopic murine model. Methods: In vitro binding of Syndecan-1 probe to the human pancreatic cancer cell line S2VP10 was evaluated on flow cytometry. For in vivo testing, S2VP10 cells were orthotopically implanted into the pancreas of severe combined immunodeficiency mice. At 7 d after implantation, the mice were intravenously injected with Syndecan-1 probe, and tumor uptake was evaluated with MSOT at multiple time points. Comparison was made with a free-dye control, indocyanine green (ICG). Probe uptake was verified ex vivo with fluorescent imaging. Results: Syndecan-1 probe demonstrated partial binding to S2VP10 cells in vitro. In vivo, Syndecan-1 probe preferentially accumulated in the pancreas tumor (480 MSOT a.u.) compared with off-target organs, including the liver (67 MSOT a.u.) and kidney (96 MSOT a.u.). Syndecan-1 probe accumulation peaked at 6 h (480 MSOT a.u.), whereas the ICG control dye failed to demonstrate similar retention within the tumor bed (0.0003 MSOT a. u.). At peak accumulation, signal intensity was 480 MSOT a. u., resulting in several times greater signal in the tumor bed than in the kidney or liver. Ex vivo fluorescent imaging comparing tumor signal with that within off-target organs confirmed the in vivo results. Conclusions: MSOT demonstrates successful accumulation of Syndecan-1 probe within pancreatic tumors, and provides high-resolution images, which allow noninvasive, realtime comparison of signal within individual organs. Syndecan-1 probe preferentially accumulates within a pancreatic adenocarcinoma model, with minimal off-target effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The basis of this tracking system is a fluorescence emitting biomaterial obtained by covalent binding of the fluorophore tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) onto the backbone of chitosan. Using confocal microscopy, this study quantitated the reductions in fluorescence intensity of the membrane and correlated these decreases with weight loss during polymer breakdown, thereby providing a technique for non-destructively assessing the extent of degradation of chitosan materials over time in vitro. Using multispectral imaging in a mouse model, the study assessed the degradation profile of the fluorophore-labeled biomaterial in vivo in real time and identified the dispersing pathway of the chitosan membrane degradation products in vivo. The results revealed that TRITC conjugated chitosan was biocompatible and supported bone cell growth.

Spectral distortion becomes severe as increasing the angle of the imaging fiber or shortening camera exposure time for fast image acquisition. Moreover, spectral ranges from 450 to 550 nm are more susceptible to the angle-dependent spectral distortion than longer spectral ranges.

Results: Volumetric MSOT achieved real-time imaging and characterization of the entire carotid bifurcation area across three dimensions simultaneously captured in a single volumetric image frame.

Time-gated detection of intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) making use of external triggering was used to effectively eliminate the laser scattering and contribute to the highly sensitive in vivo measurements. Artificial tissue-simulating phantoms consisting of polystyrene microspheres and tissue fluorophores were tested to optimize the gating parameters. 51-ns gate width and 39-ns gate delays were determined to be the optimal parameters for sensitive detection. In vivo measurements with the optical diagnosis system were applied to esophagus, stomach, and small intestine using an endoscope in canine animal studies. The rapid tuning capability of the optical diagnosis system contributed greatly to the optimization of wavelength for the observation of porphyrin in the small intestine.

By generating photoacoustic (PA) signals using simultaneous and time-delayed pump and probe excitation pulses at fluences below the maximum permissible exposure, a modulation of the signal amplitude is observed in fluorophores but not in endogenous chromophores. This provides a highly specific contrast mechanism that can be used to recover the location of the fluorophore using difference imaging. The practical challenges in applying this method to in vivo PA tomography include the typically low concentrations of fluorescent contrast agents, and tissue motion. The former results in smaller PA signal amplitudes compared to those measured in blood, while the latter gives rise to difference image artefacts that compromise the unambiguous and potentially noise-limited detection of fluorescent contrast agents. To address this limitation, a method based on interleaved pump-probe image acquisition was developed. It relies on fast switching between simultaneous and time-delayed pump-probe excitation to acquire PA difference signals in quick succession, and to minimise the effects of tissue motion.

A high tumour-to-background (T/B) ratio is crucial for successful imaging, which strongly depends on tumour-specific probes that rapidly accumulate in the tumour, while non-bound probes are rapidly cleared. Here, using pre-invasive breast cancer as a model, we investigate whether the use of combinations of probes with different target specificities results in higher T/B ratios and whether dual-spectral imaging leads to improvements in tumour characterization. Methods: We performed optical molecular imaging of an orthotopic breast cancer model mimicking ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). A combination of carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)- and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-specific variable domains of the heavy chain from heavy-chain antibodies (VHHs) was conjugated either to the same fluorophore (IRDye800CW) to evaluate T/B ratios or to different fluorophores (IRDye800CW, IRDye680RD or IRDye700DX) to analyse the expression of CAIX and HER2 simultaneously through dual-fluorescence detection. These experiments were performed non-invasively in vivo, in a mimicked intra-operative setting, and ex vivo on tumour sections. Results: Application of the CAIX-and HER2-specific VHH combination resulted in an increase of the T/B ratio, as compared to T/B ratios obtained from each of these single VHHs together with an irrelevant VHH. This dual tumour marker-specific VHH combination also enabled the detection of small metastases in the lung. Furthermore, dual-spectral imaging enabled the assessment of the expression status of both CAIX and HER2 in a mimicked intra-operative setting, as well as on tumour sections, which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry.

T1- and T2- weighted ( W) black blood spin echo imaging was performed in 1 axial slice, and the T1- W imaging was repeated after a Gd- DTPA - enhanced 3D magnetic resonance angiogram. A section of the aorta at the site of imaging was resected at surgery for histopathologic examination of tissue components and inflammatory cells.

Aim: The aim of this work was to develop a compact SFDI imager for widefield imaging of in-vivo tissue optical properties and verify its ability to measure optical properties of tissue-simulating phantoms and in a preclinical model of burn wounds. Approach: This compound-eye imager was constructed using a CMOS sensor subdivided into multiple regions, each having a bandpass filter and objective lens. The ability of the instrument to image optical properties was compared with (1) a commercial SFDI imager and (2) a laboratory-based system. Initial validation of ability to accurately characterize optical properties was performed using a tissue-simulating optical phantom. It was then applied to an established murine model of thermal contact burn severity. In-vivo measurements of the optical properties of rat skin were performed before and after the application of burns. Histology was used to verify burn severity. Results: Measurements of the tissue-simulating phantom optical properties made using the compound-eye imager agree with measurements made using the two comparison SFDI devices. For the murine burn model, the burns showed a decrease in the reduced scattering coefficient at all measurement wavelengths compared with preburn measurements at the same locations. This is consistent with previously reported changes in scattering that occur in full-thickness burns.

We have developed a dual-modality system, incorporating optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), that is capable of simultaneously characterizing the 3-D tissue morphology and its biochemical composition. The Fourier domain OCT subsystem, at an 830 nm center wavelength, provided high-resolution morphological volumetric tissue images with an axial and lateral resolution of 7.3 and 13.4 mu m, respectively. The multispectral FLIM subsystem, based on a direct pulse-recording approach (upon 355 nm laser excitation), provided two-dimensional superficial maps of the tissue autofluorescence intensity and lifetime at three customizable emission bands with 100 mu m lateral resolution. Both subsystems share the same excitation/illumination optical path and are simultaneously raster scanned on the sample to generate coregistered OCT volumes and FLIM images. The developed OCT/FLIM system was capable of a maximum A-line rate of 59 KHz for OCT and a pixel rate of up to 30 KHz for FLIM.

However, the subjective nature of histopathology leads to inevitable discordance among pathologists. Specifically, the inter-observer discordance could be up to 40% for the differentiation between Gleason score 6 (low-grade) and 7 (high-grade) of PCa. According to clinical guidelines, patients with high-grade PCa need to be actively treated, while patients with low-grade PCa could undergo active surveillance due to its slowly growing feature. Therefore, differentiating high-grade and low-grade PCa is an urgent clinical need. By integrating stimulated Raman scattering microscopy and confocal Raman spectroscopy, our previous study found the aberrant cholesteryl ester (CE) accumulation in human PCa tissues. However, no significant difference in CE accumulation between the low-grade and high-grade PCa was found, primarily because the previous study only analyzed the composition of manually selected lipid droplets (LDs) without quantitative analysis of the whole field of view.

Unlike other optical imaging methods, SIP-PACT sees through similar to 5 cm of tissue in vivo, and acquires cross-sectional images with an in-plane resolution of similar to 100 mu m. Such capabilities allow us to image, for the first time, mouse wholebody dynamics in real time with clear sub-organ anatomical and functional details and without motion artifacts. SIPPACT can capture transients of whole-body oxygen saturation and pulse wave propagation in vivo without labeling.

Optimal tension application regimens may be an important component for skin tissue engineering and dermatogenesis. In this study, we designed and tested a novel servo-controlled skin-stretching device to apply predetermined tension and waveforms in mice. The effects of static and cyclical stretching forces were compared in 48 mice by measuring epidermal proliferation, angiogenesis, cutaneous perfusion, and principal growth factors using immunohistochemistry, real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and hyperspectral imaging. All stretched samples had upregulated epidermal proliferation and angiogenesis. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor beta 1, and nerve growth factor demonstrated greater expression in cyclically stretched skin when compared to static stretch. Hypoxia-induced factor 1 alpha was significantly upregulated in cyclically stretched skin, but poststretch analysis demonstrated well-oxygenated tissue, collectively suggesting the presence of transient hypoxia. Waveform-specific mechanical loads may accelerate tissue growth by mechanotransduction and as a result of repeated cycles of temporary hypoxia.

In order to be informative, this label-free method requires careful multispectral or hyperspectral recording of autofluorescence images followed by unsupervised extraction (unmixing) of biochemical signatures. The unmixing is difficult due to the scarcity of biochemically pure regions in cells and also because autofluorescence is weak compared with signals from labelled cells, typically leading to low signal to noise ratio. Here, we solve the problem of unsupervised hyperspectral unmixing of cellular autofluorescence by introducing the Robust Dependent Component Analysis (RoDECA). This approach provides sophisticated and statistically robust quantitative biochemical analysis of cellular autofluorescence images. We validate our method on artificial images, where the addition of varying known level of noise has allowed us to quantify the accuracy of our RoDECA analysis in a way that can be applied to real biological datasets. The same unsupervised statistical minimisation is then applied to imaging of mouse retinal photoreceptor cells where we establish the identity of key endogenous fluorophores (free NADH, FAD and lipofuscin) and derive the corresponding molecular abundance maps.

The purpose of this study is to develop a stand for in vivo skin state examination by scattering ellipsometry with a help of studying of anisotropic skin environment influence on the polarization state evolution of the radiation propagating in this skin. The possibility of implementation the method of quantitative ellipsometry for in vivo skin's optical anisotropy and structural heterogeneity studies is shown. The Mueller matrix algebra is used for describing polarization properties of the depolarizing optically-active biotissue medium. A setup for recording the polarization state of the backscattered radiation was designed based on a comparative analysis of the technical options and their application in experiments with biotissue. To have a uniform intensity distribution along the cross section of the input radiation beam, and also to form the polarization states necessary for the study, using the emitting channel of the LEF-3 ellipsometer in the optical scheme of the stand is proposed. The choice of the radiation source wavelength in the spectral range (He-Ne laser, 632 nm) is justified, in which radiation scattering in turbid biological media predominates over absorption, which makes it possible to tell about the sample structural parameters by changing output radiation polarization state. The receiving channel of the output polarization state analyzer was designed, which contains based on a color matrix sensor with a unified analysis field video information block, that allows further multispectral studying of the skin surface structure. The method of a skin ellipsometric examination based on the distribution visualization of the polarization state parameters along the cross section of the output radiation beam and on its subsequent analysis is proposed.

This can be used to assess pathogen impact on plant condition both prior to and after visual symptoms appear. Challenging this capacity is the fact that dead tissue yields relatively consistent changes in leaf optical properties, negatively impacting our ability to distinguish causal pathogen identity. Here, we used in-situ spectroscopy to detect and differentiate Phytophthora infestans (late blight) and Alternaria solani (early blight) on potato foliage over the course of disease development and explored non-destructive characterization of contrasting disease physiology. Phytophthora infestans, a hemibiotrophic pathogen, undergoes an obligate latent period of two-seven days before disease symptoms appear. In contrast, A. solani, a necrotrophic pathogen, causes symptoms to appear almost immediately when environmental conditions are conducive. We found that respective patterns of spectral change can be related to these differences in underlying disease physiology and their contrasting pathogen lifestyles. Hyperspectral measurements could distinguish both P. infestans-infected and A. solani-infected plants with greater than 80% accuracy two-four days before visible symptoms appeared. Individual disease development stages for each pathogen could be differentiated from respective controls with 89-95% accuracy. Notably, we could distinguish latent P. infestans infection from both latent and symptomatic A. solani infection with greater than 75% accuracy. Spectral features important for late blight detection shifted over the course of infection, whereas spectral features important for early blight detection remained consistent, reflecting their different respective pathogen biologies. Shortwave infrared wavelengths were important for differentiation between healthy and diseased, and between pathogen infections, both pre- and post-symptomatically.

Discrimination between tumour and inflammation could be therefore difficult. Improvement of fluorescence diagnosis through observation of cell metabolism could be the solution, which needs a detailed understanding of the origin of autofluorescence. However, a complex combination of fluorophores give rise to the emission signal. Also in PDD (photodynamic diagnosis) different photosensitizer metabolites contribute to the fluorescence signal. Therefore, the fluorescence decay in many cases does not show a simple monoexponential profile. In those cases a considerable improvement could be achieved when time-resolved and spectral-resolved techniques are simultaneously incorporated.

Bioluminescence light, however, is strongly scattered in biological tissue and no direct image of the light-emitting reporter probe's location can be obtained. Therefore, the authors have developed a linear image reconstruction method for bioluminescence tomography (BLT) that recovers the three-dimensional spatial bioluminescent source distribution in small animals. Methods: The proposed reconstruction method uses third-order simplified spherical harmonics (SP3) solutions to the equation of radiative transfer for modeling the bioluminescence light propagation in optically nonuniform tissue. The SP3 equations and boundary conditions are solved with a finite-difference (FD) technique on a regular grid. The curved geometry of the animal surface was taken into account with a blocking-off region method for regular grids. Coregistered computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images provide information regarding the geometry of the skin surface and internal organs. The inverse source problem is defined as an algebraic system of linear equations for the unknown source distribution and is iteratively solved given multiview and multispectral boundary measurements. The average tissue absorption parameters, which are used for the image reconstruction process, were calculated with an evolution strategy (ES) from in vivo measurements using an implanted pointlike source of known location and spectrum. Moreover, anatomical information regarding the location of the internal organs and other tissue structures within the animal's body are provided by coregistered MR images. Results: First, the authors recovered the wavelength-dependent absorption coefficients (average error of 14%) with the ES under ideal conditions by using a numerical mouse model. Next, they reconstructed the average absorption coefficient of a small animal by using an artificial implanted light source and the validated ES. Last, they conducted two in vivo animal experiments and recovered the spatial location of the implanted light source and the spatial distribution of a bioluminescent reporter system located in the kidneys. The source reconstruction results were coregistered to CT and MR images. They further found that accurate bioluminescence image reconstructions could be obtained when segmenting a voidlike cyst with low-scattering and absorption parameters, whereas inaccurate image reconstructions were obtained when assuming a uniform optical parameter distribution instead. The image reconstructions were completed within 23 min on a 3 GHz Intel processor. Conclusions: The authors demonstrated on in vivo examples that the combination of anatomical coregistration, accurate optical tissue properties, multispectral acquisition, and a blocking-off FD-SP3 solution of the radiative transfer model significantly improves the accuracy of the BLT reconstructions.

In our study, this depth limitation is overcome by using intravascular light delivery with a thin optical fiber. To demonstrate in vitro blood clot characterization, clots with different acuteness and oxygenation levels were placed underneath ten-centimeter-thick chicken breast tissue and imaged using multiple wavelengths. Acoustic frequency analysis was performed on the received PA channel signals, and oxygenation level was estimated using multispectral linear spectral unmixing. The results show that, with intravascular light delivery, clot oxygenation level can be accurately measured, and the clot age can thus be estimated. In addition, we found that retracted and unretracted clots had different acoustic frequency spectrum. While unretracted clots had stronger high frequency components, retracted clots had much higher low frequency components due to densely packed red blood cells. The PACT characterization of the clots was consistent with the histology results and mechanical tests.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "Pulse length variation causing spectral distortions in OPO-based hyperspectral coherent Raman scattering microscopy", "abstract": "Picosecond optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) with broad wavelength tunability are frequently used as light sources in hyperspectral coherent Raman scattering (CRS) microscopy.

In living tissues, however, cells and extracellular matrix coexist and interact. To acquire information on this cell-matrix interaction, we developed a technique for colocalized, correlative multispectral tissue analysis by implementing high-sensitivity, wide-field fluorescence imaging on a confocal Raman microscope. As a proof of principle, we study early stages of bone formation in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae because the zebrafish has emerged as a model organism to study vertebrate development. The newly formed bones were stained using a calcium fluorescent marker and the maturation process was imaged and chemically characterized in vivo. Results obtained from early stages of mineral deposition in the zebrafish fin bone unequivocally show the presence of hydrogen phosphate containing mineral phases in addition to the carbonated apatite mineral.

Multispectral structural MRI methods have been proposed to improve automated hippocampal subfield segmentation accuracy, but the reproducibility in a multicentric setting is, to date, not well characterized. Here, we assessed test-retest reproducibility of FreeSurfer 6.0 hippocampal subfield segmentations using multispectral MRI analysis pipelines (22 healthy subjects scanned twice, a week apart, at four 3T MRI sites). The harmonized MRI protocol included two 3D-T1, a 3D-FLAIR, and a high-resolution 2D-T2. After within-session T1 averaging, subfield volumes were segmented using three pipelines with different multispectral data: two longitudinal (long_T1s and long_T1s_FLAIR) and one cross-sectional (long_T1s_FLAIR_crossT2). Volume reproducibility was quantified in magnitude (reproducibility error-RE) and space (DICE coefficient). RE was lower in all hippocampal subfields, except for hippocampal fissure, using the longitudinal pipelines compared to long_T1s_FLAIR_crossT2 (average RE reduction of 0.4-3.6%). Similarly, the longitudinal pipelines showed a higher spatial reproducibility (1.1-7.8% of DICE improvement) in all hippocampal structures compared to long_T1s_FLAIR_crossT2. Moreover, long_T1s_FLAIR provided a small but significant RE improvement in comparison to long_T1s (p = 0.015), whereas no significant DICE differences were found. In addition, structures with volumes larger than 200 mm(3) had better RE (1-2%) and DICE (0.7-0.95) than smaller structures. In summary, our study suggests that the most reproducible hippocampal subfield FreeSurfer segmentations are derived from a longitudinal pipeline using 3D-T1s and 3D-FLAIR.

Early CRC detection can decrease its incidence and substantially improve patient prognosis. Detection of potentially malignant lesions can be performed by optical techniques, which are molecular sensitive and have shown great potential for tissue differentiation and guidance of colorectal diagnostic procedures such as colonoscopy. One of these techniques is diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), which evaluates tissue biochemistry and micro/nano-structure based on its diffuse reflected light containing the information about tissue absorption and scattering properties. In this study, we assessed the improvement of the diagnostic potential of DRS for CRC detection upon extending the tissue probed depth and wavelength ranges investigated in previous studies. This assessment was performed by calculating classification performance metrics of differentiation between normal mucosa and cancer tissues by using 6 multivariate analysis models based on support vector machines (SVMs).

The authors designed a real-time handheld optoacoustic scanner for human use, based on a concave 8-MHz transducer array, attaining 135 degrees angular coverage. They applied a single-pulse-frame (SPF) sequence, which enabled motion insensitive optoacoustic imaging during handheld operation. SPF optoacoustic imaging was applied to imaging arteries and microvascular landmarks in the lower extremities of 10 healthy volunteers. The diameters selected microvessels were determined by measuring the full width at half maximum through the vessels in the MSOT images. Duplex ultrasonography was performed on the same landmarks in seven of the 10 volunteers for subjective comparison to the corresponding optoacoustic images. Results: Optoacoustic imaging resolved blood vessels as small as 100 mu m in diameter and within 1 cm depth. Additionally, MSOT provided images reflecting hemoglobin oxygen saturation in blood vessels, clearly identifying arteries and veins, and was able to identify pulsation in arteries during imaging. Larger blood vessels, specifically the tibialis posterior and the dorsalis pedis arteries, were also visualized with MSOT.

Pegylated hyperbranched polymers were labelled with fluorescent markers and targeting ligands against two different prostate cancer markers; prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and the protein kinase, EphrinA2 receptor (EphA2). The PSMA targeted nanomedicine utilised a small molecule glutamate urea inhibitor of the protein, while the EphA2 targeted nanomedicine was conjugated to a single-chain variable fragment based on the antibody 4B3 that has shown high affinity to the receptor. Hyperbranched polymers were synthesised bearing the different targeting ligands. In the case of the EphA2-targeting nanomedicine, significant in vitro uptake was observed in PC3 prostate cancer cells that overexpress the receptor, while low uptake was observed in LNCaP cells (that have minimal expression of this receptor). Conversely, the PSMA-targeted nanomedicine showed high uptake in LNCaP cells, with only minor uptake in the PC3 cells. In a dual-tumour xenograft mouse model, the nanomedicines showed high uptake in tumours in which the receptor was overexpressed, with only minimal non-specific accumulation in the low-expression tumours. This work highlighted the importance of clearly defining the target of interest in next-generation nanomedicines, and suggests that dual-targeting in such nanomedicines may be a means to achieve greater efficacy.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "Transcranial Photoacoustic Detection of Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption Following Focused Ultrasound-Mediated Nanoparticle Delivery", "abstract": "Purpose Blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD) is of interest for treating neurodegenerative diseases and tumors by enhancing drug delivery. Focused ultrasound (FUS) is a powerful method to alleviate BBB challenges; however, the detection of BBB opening by non-invasive methods remains limited. The purpose of this work is to demonstrate that 3D transcranial color Doppler (3DCD) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) combined with custom-made nanoparticle (NP)-mediated FUS delivery can detect BBBD in mice. Procedures We use MRI and stereotactic ultrasound-mediated BBBD to create and confirm four openings in the left hemisphere and inject intravenously indocyanine green (ICG) and three sizes (40 nm, 100 nm, and 240 nm in diameter) of fluorophore-labeled NPs. We use PAI and fluorescent imaging (FI) to assess the spatial distribution of ICG/NPs in tissues. Results A reversible 41 +/- 12 % (n = 8) decrease in diameter of the left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) relative to the right after FUS treatment is found using CD images. The spectral unmixing of photoacoustic images of the in vivo (2 h post FUS), perfused, and ex vivo brain reveals a consistent distribution pattern of ICG and NPs at *FUS locations. Ex vivo spectrally unmixed photoacoustic images show that the opening width is, on average, 1.18 +/- 0.12 mm and spread laterally 0.49 +/- 0.05 mm which correlated well with the BBB opening locations on MR images. In vivo PAI confirms a deposit of NPs in tissues for hours and potentially days, is less sensitive to NPs of lower absorbance at a depth greater than 3 mm and too noisy with NPs above an absorbance of 85.4. FI correlates well with ex vivo PAI to a depth of 3 mm in tissues for small NPs and 4.74 mm for large NPs.

Fluorescence and bioluminescence imaging have primarily been used to image infections in animal models, but optical scattering in tissue significantly limits imaging depth and resolution. Photoacoustic imaging, which has improved depth-to-resolution ratio compared to conventional optical imaging, could be useful for visualizing melA-expressing bacteria since melA is a bacterial tyrosinase homologue which produces melanin. Escherichia coli-expressing melA was visibly dark in liquid culture. When melA-expressing bacteria in tubes were imaged with a VisualSonics Vevo LAZR system, the signal-to-noise ratio of a 9x dilution sample was 55, suggesting that similar to 20 bacteria cells could be detected with our system. Multispectral (680, 700, 750, 800, 850, and 900 nm) analysis of the photoacoustic signal allowed unmixing of melA-expressing bacteria from blood. To compare photoacoustic reporter gene melA (using Vevo system) with luminescent and fluorescent reporter gene Nano-lantern (using Bruker Xtreme In-Vivo system), tubes of bacteria expressing melA or Nano-lantern were submerged 10 mm in 1% Intralipid, spaced between <1 and 20 mm apart from each other, and imaged with the appropriate imaging modality. Photoacoustic imaging could resolve the two tubes of melA-expressing bacteria even when the tubes were less than 1 mm from each other, while bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging could not resolve the two tubes of Nano-lantern- expressing bacteria even when the tubes were spaced 10 mm from each other. After injecting 100-mu L of melA-expressing bacteria in the back flank of a chicken embryo, photoacoustic imaging allowed visualization of melA-expressing bacteria up to 10-mm deep into the embryo. Photoacoustic signal from melA could also be separated from deoxy-and oxy-hemoglobin signal observed within the embryo and chorioallantoic membrane. Our results suggest that melA is a useful photoacoustic reporter gene for visualizing bacteria, and further work incorporating photoacoustic reporters into infectious bacterial strains is warranted.

In this work, with the use of rapid hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering microscopy associated with an aryl-alkyne-based Raman tag synthesized, we investigate dynamic interactions between vancomycin and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) biofilm to gain new insights into the resistance mechanisms of the biofilm. Methods: We utilize spectral focusing hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering microscopy ensued with multivariate curve resolution analysis to spectrally decompose S. aureus biofilm into its major components (i.e., bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances). Concurrently, vancomycin is conjugated with aryl-alkyne Raman tag (Raman peak at 2218 cm(-1)) for in vivo tracking of its uptake into biofilm without tissue interference. Results: We find that vancomycin penetration is a non-uniform diffusion process with penetration depths limited by the preferential affinity to the cell clusters. Semi-quantitative analysis shows that the majority of vancomycin binds to the bacteria, achieving intracellular concentrations of up to 4- to 10- fold higher than the administered dosage. The diffusion constant of similar to 3.16 mu m(2)/min based on the diffusion and antibiotic binding equations is obtained that well accounts for the antibiotic penetration into the biofilm. SRS longitudinal monitoring of antibiotic effect on the growth of biofilms shows that the antibiotics can eradicate the upper layer of the biofilm exposed to sufficient dosages, while the lower layer of the biofilm at a sub-inhibitory dose remains viable, eventually re-growing to significant bio-volume.

It is, therefore, essential in maintaining tissue health. Aberrations in microcirculation are potentially indicative of underlying cardiovascular and metabolic pathologies. Thus, quantitative information about it is of great clinical relevance. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a capable technique that relies on the generation of imaging contrast via the absorption of light and can image at micron-scale resolution. PAI is especially desirable to map microvasculature as hemoglobin strongly absorbs light and can generate a photoacoustic signal. This paper reviews the current state of the art for imaging microvascular networks using photoacoustic imaging. We further describe how quantitative information about blood dynamics such as the total hemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation, and blood flow rate is obtained using PAI. We also discuss its importance in understanding key pathophysiological processes in neurovascular, cardiovascular, ophthalmic, and cancer research fields. We then discuss the current challenges and limitations of PAI and the approaches that can help overcome these limitations.

Diffuse reflectance (DR) spectra recorded with white light illumination is utilized to detect periodontal inflammation from the oxygenated hemoglobin absorption ratio R620/R575. A multispectral imaging system is utilized to record narrow-band DR images at 575 and 620 nm from the anterior sextant of the gingivia of 15 healthy volunteers and 25 patients (N = 40). An experienced periodontist assesses the level of gingival inflammation at each site through periodontal probing and assigns diagnosis as healthy, mild, moderate, or severe inflammation. The DR image ratio R620/R575 computed for each pixel (8-mu m resolution) from the monochrome images is pseudo-color-mapped to identify gingival inflammation sites. The DR image ratio values at each site are compared with clinical diagnosis to estimate the specificity and sensitivity of the DR imaging technique in inflammation mapping.

To correlate in vivo spatial and spectral morphologic changes of short- to long-pulse 532 nm Nd:YAG retinal laser lesions using Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (FD OCT), autofluorescence (AF), fluorescein angiography (FA), and multispectral imaging. METHODS. Ten eyes with treatment-naive preproliferative or proliferative diabetic retinopathy were studied. A titration grid of laser burns at 20, 100, and 200 milliseconds was applied to the nasal retina and laser fluence titrated to produce four grades of laser lesion visibility: subvisible (SV), barely visible (BV, light-gray), threshold (TH, gray-white), and suprathreshold (ST, white). The AF, FA, FD-OCT, and multispectral imaging were performed 1 week before laser, and 1 hour, 4 weeks, and 3 and 6 months post-laser. Multi-spectral imaging measured relative tissue oxygen concentration. RESULTS. Laser burn visibility and lesion size increased in a linear relationship according to fixed fluence levels. At fixed pulse durations, there was a semilogarithmic increase in lesion size over 6 months. At 20 milliseconds, all grades of laser lesion were reduced significantly in size after 6 months: SV, 51%; BV, 54%; TH, 49%; and ST, 50% (P < 0.001), with retinal pigment epithelial proliferation and photoreceptor infilling. At 20 milliseconds, there was healing of photoreceptor inner segment/outer segment junction layers compared with 100- and 200-millisecond lesions. Significant increases in mean tissue oxygenation (range, four to six units) within the laser titration area and in oxygen concentration across the laser lesions (P < 0.01) were detected at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS. For patients undergoing therapeutic laser, there may be improved tissue oxygenation, higher predictability of burn morphology, and more spatial localization of healing responses of burns at 20 milliseconds compared with longer pulse durations over time.

Gold nanoparticles are often discussed as potential sonophores due to their large absorption cross-section and their tunable plasmon resonance. However, disadvantages such as toxicity and low photoacoustic efficiency in the tissue transparency window prevail, preventing their clinical application. As a result, there remains a strong need to develop colloidal photoacoustic contrast agents which absorb in the tissue transparency window, exhibit high photoacoustic signal, and are biocompatible.

Clinical stratification between vaccine-associated benign lymphadenopathies and malignant lymphadenopathies through ultrasound, MRI or FDG PET-CT is not feasible. This leads to unnecessary lymph node biopsies, excisions and even radical lymph node dissections. Therefore, to avoid unnecessary surgeries, we assessed whether noninvasive multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) enables a better differentiation between benign and malignant lymphadenopathies. Patients and MethodsAll patients were vaccinated for COVID-19. We used MSOT to image deoxy- and oxyhaemoglobin levels in lymph nodes of tumour patients to assess metastatic status. MSOT imaging results were compared with standard ultrasound and pathological lymph node analysis. We also evaluated the influences of gender, age and time between vaccination and MSOT measurement of lymph nodes on the measured deoxy- and oxyhaemoglobin levels in patients with reactive lymph node changes. ResultsMultispectral optoacoustic tomography was able to identify cancer-free lymph nodes in vivo without a single false negative (33 total lymph nodes), with 100% sensitivity and 50% specificity. A statistically significant higher deoxyhaemoglobin content was detected in patients with tumour manifestations in the lymph node (p = 0.02). There was no statistically significant difference concerning oxyhaemoglobin (p = 0.65). Age, sex and time between vaccination and MSOT measurement had statistically non-significant impact on deoxy- and oxyhaemoglobin levels in patients with reactive lymph nodes.

Each technique offers unique advantages and disadvantages, many of which pose a compromise between effectiveness and accuracy versus ease of use and cost considerations. Details about these techniques and comparisons are available in the literature(4). Infrared (IR) imaging was shown to be a useful method to diagnose the signs of certain diseases by measuring the local skin temperature. There is a large body of evidence showing that disease or deviation from normal functioning are accompanied by changes of the temperature of the body, which again affect the temperature of the skin(5,6). Accurate data about the temperature of the human body and skin can provide a wealth of information on the processes responsible for heat generation and thermoregulation, in particular the deviation from normal conditions, often caused by disease.

We present a novel method for estimating the internal organ structure of a mouse by warping a labeled 3D volumetric mouse atlas with the constraint that the surfaces of the two should match. Surface-constrained harmonic maps used for this bijective warping are computed by minimizing the covariant harmonic energy. We demonstrate the application of this warping scheme in OBT, where scattering and absorption coefficients of tissue are functions of the internal anatomy and hence, better estimates of the organ structures can lead to a more accurate forward model resulting in improved source localization. We first estimated the subject's internal geometry using the atlas-based warping scheme. Then the mouse was tessellated and optical properties were assigned based on the estimated organ structure.

Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) is a known inflammatory biomarker, and it increases in the choroidal neovascular tissues characteristic of this experimental model. We have designed and constructed gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with hairpin-DNA that incorporates an antisense sequence complementary to VCAM-1 mRNA (AS-VCAM-1 hAuNPs) and tested them as optical imaging probes. The 3' end of the hairpin is coupled to a near-infrared fluorophore that is quenched by the AuNP surface via Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Hybridization of the antisense sequence to VCAM-1 mRNA displaces the fluorophore away from the AuNP surface, inducing fluorescent activity. In vitro testing showed that hAuNPs hybridize to an exogenous complementary oligonucleotide within a pH range of 4.5-7.4, and that they are stable at reduced pH. LCNV mice received tail-vein injections of AS-VCAM-1 hAuNPs. Hyperspectral imaging revealed the delivery of AS-VCAM-1 hAuNPs to excised choroidal tissues.

This approach involves long manual procedures which can be accompanied by human errors, subjectivity, and lack of reproducibility. Vibrational microscopies are capable of directly providing chemical and biomolecular information on tissues, identifying them through their fingerprint vibrational spectra without the need of staining and, thus, constitute powerful tools for label-free and objective tumour identification.

The emission spectra of cells isolated from human adenocarcinoma and normal mucosa of the colon were studied and showed markedly greater emission intensity from cancerous cells compared to cells obtained from the surrounding normal mucosa. A proto-type multispectral imaging system optimized for ultraviolet macroscopic imaging of tissue was used to obtain autofluorescence images of surgical specimens of colonic neoplasms and normal mucosa after resection. Fluorescence images did not display the expected greater emission from the tumor as compared to the normal mucosa, most probably due to increased optical absorption and scattering in the tumors. Increased fluorescence intensity in neoplasms was observed however, once fluorescence images were corrected using reflectance images.

The use of adaptive mesh refinement and permissible source region based on a posteriori measures not only avoids the dimension disaster arising from the multispectral measured data but also reduces the ill-posedness of BLT and therefore improves the reconstruction quality.

Nevertheless, in vivo delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) remains a crucial challenge for therapeutic success. siRNAs on their own are not taken up by most mammalian cells in a way that preserves their activity. Moreover, when applied in vivo, siRNA-based approaches are all limited by poor penetration into the target tissue and low silencing efficiency. To circumvent these limitations, we have developed novel polymerized polyglycerol-based dendrimer core shell structures to deliver siRNA to tumors in vivo. These cationic dendrimers can strongly improve the stability of the siRNA, its intracellular trafficking, its silencing efficacy, and its accumulation in the tumor environment owing to the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Here, we show that our dendritic nanocarriers exhibited low cytotoxicity and high efficacy in delivering active siRNA into cells.

Importantly, significant gene silencing was accomplished in vivo within 24 h of treatment with our luciferase siRNA-nanocarrier polyplexes, as measured by noninvasive intravital bioluminescence imaging. Moreover, our siRNA-nanocarriers show very low levels of toxicity as no significant weight loss was observed after intravenous administration of the polyplexes.

Methods: Cu2MnS2 NPs were synthesized through a facile and environmentally friendly process. A series of experiments, including the characterization of Cu2MnS2 NPs, the long-term toxicity of Cu2MnS2 NPs in BALB/c nude mice, the applications of Cu2MnS2 NPs for in vitro and in vivo MRI/MSOT dual-modal imaging and NIR-II PTT of cancer were carried out.

However, coexisting pathologies, such as fibrosis and steatosis, affect R2* measurements and may thus confound HIC estimations. Purpose To evaluate whether a multispectral auto regressive moving average (ARMA) model can be used in conjunction with quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) to measure magnetic susceptibility as a confounder-free predictor of HIC. Study Type Phantom study and in vivo cohort. Subjects Nine iron phantoms covering clinically relevant R2* range (20-1200/second) and 48 patients (22 male, 26 female, median age 18 years). Field Strength/Sequence Three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) multi-echo gradient echo (GRE) at 1.5 T. Assessment ARMA-QSM modeling was performed on the complex 3D GRE signal to estimate R2*, fat fraction (FF), and susceptibility measurements. R2*-based dry clinical HIC values were calculated from the 2D GRE acquisition using a published R2*-HIC calibration curve as reference standard. Statistical Tests Linear regression analysis was performed to compare ARMA R2* and susceptibility-based estimates to iron concentrations and dry clinical HIC values in phantoms and patients, respectively. Results In phantoms, the ARMA R2* and susceptibility values strongly correlated with iron concentrations (R-2 >= 0.9). In patients, the ARMA R2* values highly correlated (R-2 = 0.97) with clinical HIC values with slope = 0.026, and the susceptibility values showed good correlation (R-2 = 0.82) with clinical dry HIC values with slope = 3.3 and produced a dry-to-wet HIC ratio of 4.8. Data Conclusion This study shows the feasibility that ARMA-QSM can simultaneously estimate susceptibility-based wet HIC, R2*-based dry HIC and FFs from a single multi-echo GRE acquisition. Our results demonstrate that both, R2* and susceptibility-based wet HIC values estimated with ARMA-QSM showed good association with clinical dry HIC values with slopes similar to published R2*-biopsy HIC calibration and dry-to-wet tissue weight ratio, respectively. Hence, our study shows that ARMA-QSM can provide potentially confounder-free assessment of hepatic iron overload.

Algorithm testing is performed in simulated mathematical phantoms and agar gel phantoms containing mixed fat/water regions. Methods: Proton resonance frequencies (PRFs), apparent spin-spin relaxation (T2*) times, and T1-weighted (T1-W) amplitude values were calculated for each voxel using a single-peak autoregressive moving average (ARMA) signal model. These parameters were then used as criteria for k-means sorting, with the results used to determine PRF ranges of each chemical species cluster for further classification. To detect the presence of secondary chemical species, spectral parameters were recalculated when needed using a two-peak ARMA signal model during the subsequent classification steps. Mathematical phantom simulations involved the modulation of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), maximum PRF shift (MPS) values, analysis window sizes, and frequency expansion factor sizes in order to characterize the algorithm performance across a variety of conditions. In agar, images were collected on a 1.5T clinical MR scanner using acquisition parameters close to simulation, and algorithm performance was assessed by comparing classification results to manually segmented maps of the fat/water regions. Results: Performance was characterized quantitatively using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), sensitivity, and specificity. The simulated mathematical phantom experiments demonstrated good fat/water separation depending on conditions, specifically high SNR, moderate MPS value, small analysis window size, and low but nonzero frequency expansion factor size. Physical phantom results demonstrated good identification for both water (0.997 +/- 0.001, 0.999 +/- 0.001, and 0.986 +/- 0.001 for DSC, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively) and fat (0.763 +/- 0.006, 0.980 +/- 0.004, and 0.941 +/- 0.002 for DSC, sensitivity, and specificity, respectively). Temperature uncertainties, based on PRF uncertainties from a 5 x 5-voxel ROI, were 0.342 and 0.351 degrees C for pure and mixed fat/water regions, respectively. Algorithm speed was tested using 25 x 25-voxel and whole image ROIs containing both fat and water, resulting in average processing times per acquisition of 2.00 +/- 0.07 s and 146 +/- 1 s, respectively, using uncompiled MATLAB scripts running on a shared CPU server with eight Intel Xeon (TM) E5640 quad-core processors (2.66 GHz, 12 MB cache) and 12 GB RAM. Conclusions: Results from both the mathematical and physical phantom suggest the k-means-based classification algorithm could be useful for rapid, dynamic imaging in an ROI for thermal interventions. Successful separation of fat/water information would aid in reducing errors from the non-temperature sensitive fat PRF, as well as potentially facilitate using fat as an internal reference for PRF shift thermometry when appropriate.

Laser speckle imaging (LSI) is a full-field, real-time imaging technique capable of mapping microvessel networks and providing relative flow velocity within the vessels. In this study, we demonstrate that LSI combine with multispectral reflectance imaging (MSRI), which allows for distinction between veins and arteries in the vascular flow maps produced by LSI. We apply this combined technique to mouse cerebral vascular network in vivo, comparing imaging through the skull, to the dura mater and brain directly through a craniectomy, and through a transparent cranial Window to the Brain (WttB) implant. Study Design/Materials and Methods The WttB implant used in this study is made of a nanocrystalline Yttria-Stabilized-Zirconia ceramic. MSRI was conducted using white-light illumination and filtering the reflected light for 560, 570, 580, 590, 600, and 610 nm. LSI was conducted using an 810 nm continuous wave near-infrared laser with incident power of 100 mW, and the reflected speckle pattern was captured by a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera. Results Seven vessel branches were analyzed and comparison was made between imaging through the skull, craniectomy, and WttB implant. Through the skull, MSRI did not detect any vessels, and LSI could not image microvessels. Imaging through the WttB implant, MSRI was able to identify veins versus arteries, and LSI was able to image microvessels with only slightly higher signal-to-noise ratio and lower sharpness than imaging the brain through a craniectomy. Conclusions This study demonstrates the ability to perform MSRI-LSI across a transparent cranial implant, to allow for cerebral vascular networks to be mapped, including microvessels. These images contain additional information such as vein-artery separation and relative blood flow velocities, information which is of value scientifically and medically. The WttB implant provides substantial improvements over imaging through the murine cranial bone, where microvessels are not visible and MSRI cannot be performed. Lasers Surg. Med.

Among the immune cells infiltrating the glioma TME, tumor-associated microglia and macrophages (TAMs) constitute the major compartment. In patients with gliomas, increased TAM abundance is associated with more aggressive disease. Alterations in TAM phenotypes and functions have been reported in preclinical models of multiple cancers during tumor development and after therapeutic interventions, including radiotherapy and molecular targeted therapies. These findings indicate that it is crucial to evaluate TAM abundance and dynamics over time. Current techniques to quantify TAMs in patients rely mainly on histological staining of tumor biopsies. Although informative, these techniques require an invasive procedure to harvest the tissue sample and typically only result in a snapshot of a small region at a single point in time.

Narrowing the Raman spectral range for analysis allows reduction of the charge-coupled device (CCD) pixels required for spectrum detection, resulting in the improvement of image acquisition speed with adequate classification accuracy.

However, CBCT is less adept to localize soft tissue targets growing in a low imaging contrast environment. Three-dimensional bioluminescence tomography (BLT) provides strong image contrast and thus offers an attractive solution. We introduced a novel and efficient BLT-guided conformal radiation therapy and demonstrated it in an orthotopic glioblastoma (GBM) model. Methods and Materials: A multispectral BLT system was integrated with SARRP for radiation therapy (RT) guidance. GBM growth curve was first established by contrast CBCT/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to derive equivalent sphere as approximated gross target volume (aGTV). For BLT, mice were subject to multispectral bioluminescence imaging, followed by SARRP CBCT imaging and optical reconstruction. The CBCT image was acquired to generate anatomic mesh for the reconstruction and RT planning. To ensure high accuracy of the BLT-reconstructed center of mass (CoM) for target localization, we optimized the optical absorption coefficients mu(a) by minimizing the distance between the CoMs of BLT reconstruction and contrast CBCT/MRI-delineated GBM volume. The aGTV combined with the uncertainties of BLT CoM localization and target volume determination was used to generate estimated target volume (ETV). For conformal irradiation procedure, the GBM was first localized by the predetermined ETV centered at BLT-reconstructed CoM, followed by SARRP radiation. The irradiation accuracy was qualitatively confirmed by pathologic staining. Results: Deviation between CoMs of BLT reconstruction and contrast CBCT/MRI-imaged GBM is approximately 1 mm. Our derived ETV centered at BLT-reconstructed CoM covers >95% of the tumor volume. Using the second-week GBM as an example, the ETV-based BLT-guided irradiation can cover 95.4% +/- 4.7% tumor volume at prescribed dose. The pathologic staining demonstrated the BLT-guided irradiated area overlapped well with the GBM location.

Due to the layered skin structure, skin tissue models are often divided into multiple layers with their associated optical properties. Typically, in the analysis, some model parameters defining these properties are fixed to values reported in the literature to speed up the fitting process and improve its performance. In the absence of consensus, various studies use different approaches in fixing the model parameters. This study aims to assess the effect of fixing various model parameters in the skin spectra fitting process on the accuracy and robustness of a GPU-accelerated two-layer inverse adding-doubling (IAD) algorithm. Specifically, the performance of the IAD method is determined for noiseless simulated skin spectra, simulated spectra with different levels of noise applied, and in-vivo measured reflectance spectra from hyperspectral images of human hands recorded before, during, and after the arterial occlusion. Our results suggest that fixing multiple parameters to a priori known values generally improves the robustness and accuracy of the IAD algorithm for simulated spectra. However, for in-vivo measured spectra, these values are unknown in advance and fixing optical parameters to incorrect values significantly deteriorates the overall performance. Therefore, we propose a method to improve the fitting performance by pre-estimating model parameters.

Proflavine hemisulfate, a vital fluorescent dye, was applied topically. The specimens were imaged with a widefield multispectral microscope and a high-resolution microendoscope. The images were compared with histopathologic examination. Results: Widefield fluorescence imaging enhanced visualization of morphology, including the presence and spatial distribution of glands, glandular distortion, atrophy, and crowding. High-resolution imaging of widefield abnormal areas revealed that neoplastic progression corresponded to glandular heterogeneity and nuclear crowding in dysplasia, with glandular effacement in carcinoma. These widefield and high-resolution image features correlated well with the histopathologic features. Limitations: This imaging approach must be validated in vivo with a larger sample size. Conclusions: Multiscale proflavine-enhanced fluorescence imaging can delineate epithelial changes in a variety of GI conditions. Distorted glandular features seen with widefield imaging could serve as a critical bridge to high-resolution probe placement. An endoscopic platform combining the two modalities with a single vital dye may facilitate point-of-care decision making by providing real-time, in vivo diagnoses.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "Rod-shape MSN@MoS2 Nanoplatform for FL/MSOT/CT Imaging-Guided Photothermal and Photodynamic Therapy", "abstract": "Rod-shape nanoplatform have received tremendous attention owing to their enhanced ability for cell internalization and high capacity for drug loading. MoS2, widely used in electronic devices, electrocatalysis, sensor and energy-storage, has been studied as photothermal agents over the years. However, the efficacy of rod-shape MoS2 based photothermal agents for photothermal therapy has not been studied before. Here, a near-infrared (NIR) light-absorbing MoS2 nanosheets coated mesoporous silica nanorods with human serum albumin (HSA) modifying and Ce6 loading (MSNR@MoS2-HSA/Ce6) were constructed for combined photothermal and photodynamic therapy. Methods: The near-infrared (NIR) light was used to trigger the synergistic anti-tumor therapy. In addition, breast cancer cell line was applied to evaluate the in vitro anti-tumor activity. The multi-modal imaging capacity and tumor-killing efficiency of the designed nanocomposites in vivo was also demonstrated with the 4T1 tumor-bearing mouse model. Results: These nanocomposites could not only perform NIR light triggered photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), but also achieve in vivo fluorescence (FL) /multispectral optical tomography (MSOT)/X-ray computed tomography (CT) triple-model bioimaging. What's more, the rod-shape nanoplatform could be endowed with better anti-tumor ability based on the EPR effect and HSA-mediated active tumor targeting. At the same time, the hyperthermia generated by MoS2 could synergistically improve the PDT effect with the acceleration of the blood flow, leading to the increase of the oxygen level in tumor tissue.

Therefore, there is a critical need for novel clinical technologies that would enable reliable oral cancer screening. The autofluorescence properties of the oral epithelial tissue provide quantitative information about morphological, biochemical, and metabolic tissue and cellular alterations accompanying carcinogenesis. This study aimed to identify novel biochemical and metabolic autofluorescence biomarkers of oral dysplasia and cancer that could be clinically imaged using novel multispectral autofluorescence lifetime imaging (maFLIM) endoscopy technologies. In vivo maFLIM clinical endoscopic images of benign, precancerous, and cancerous lesions from 67 patients were acquired using a novel maFLIM endoscope. Widefield maFLIM feature maps were generated, and statistical analyses were applied to identify maFLIM features providing contrast between dysplastic/cancerous vs. benign oral lesions. A total of 14 spectral and time-resolved maFLIM features were found to provide contrast between dysplastic/cancerous vs. benign oral lesions, representing novel biochemical and metabolic autofluorescence biomarkers of oral epithelial dysplasia and cancer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of clinical widefield maFLIM endoscopic imaging of novel biochemical and metabolic autofluorescence biomarkers of oral dysplasia and cancer, supporting the potential of maFLIM endoscopy for early detection of oral cancer.

Herein, an activatable nanocomposite probe was developed for preoperatively locating orthotopic hepatic tumor via multispectral optoacoustic tomography imaging and for intraoperative navigation via near-IR-1 (NIR-I) and NIR-II fluorescence imaging. The molecular probe comprises an electronic donor, an acceptor, and a recognition moiety and forms the nanocomposite probe with bovine serum albumin.

We observe a heterogeneous uptake which is droplet size dependent, time dependent, and lipid dependent. Cells grown in linoleic-acid-supplemented medium show the largest distribution of lipid content across different droplets at all times during differentiation. When analyzing the average lipid content, we find that adding linoleic or alpha-linolenic fatty acids at day 0 results in uptake of the new lipid components with an exponential time constant of 22 +/- 2 h.

Therefore, we studied the effects of metal oxide ENMs on the cornea in the presence or absence of injury. Cell viability of immortalized human corneal epithelial (hTCEpi) cells was assessed following treatment with 11 metal oxide ENMs with a concentration ranging from 0.5 to 250 mu g/ml for 24 h. An epithelial wound healing assay with a monolayer of hTCEpi cells was then performed using 11 metal oxide ENMs at select concentrations based on data from the viability assays.

We found that WO3, ZnO, V2O5 and CuO ENMs significantly reduced hTCEpi cell viability in comparison to vehicle control or the other metal oxide ENMs tested. Furthermore, ZnO and V2O5 ENMs also significantly decreased hTCEpi cell migration. Although ZnO and V2O5 did not alter PTF parameters of rabbits in vivo, corneal epithelial wound healing was significantly delayed by topical ZnO while V2O5 did not alter wound healing.

The underlying mechanisms that regulate such interactions remain largely unknown. NG2 is a transmembrane proteoglyean whose presence on transformed cells has been demonstrated to increase proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. To study the effects of NG2 during tumour growth and progression, we engineered an NG2 positive human glioma cell line (U251-NG2) from parental NG2 negative cells (U251-WT) and implanted both cell types stereotactically into immunodeficient nude rat brains. The tumours were longitudinally monitored in vivo using multispectral MRI employing two differently sized contrast agents (Gd-DTPA-BMA and Gadomer) to assess vascular leakiness, vasogenic oedema, tumour volumes and necrosis. Comparisons of Gd-DTPA-BMA and Gadomer revealed differences in their spatial distribution in the U251-NG2 and U251-WT tumours. The U251-NG2 tumours exhibited a higher leakiness of the larger molecular weight Gadomer and displayed a stronger vasogenic oedema (69.9 +/- 15.2, P = 0.018), compared to the controls (10.7 +/- 7.7). Moreover, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy revealed that the U251-NG2 tumours had a higher microvascular density (11.81 +/- 0.54; P = 0.0010) compared to controls (5.76 +/- 0.87), with vessels that displayed larger gaps between the endothelial cells. Thus, tumour cells can regulate both the function and structure of the host-derived tumour vasculature through NG2 expression, suggesting a role for NG2 in the cross-talk between tumour-host compartments.

In this work, the use of large spectral NIR datasets is analyzed, and an objective function to find optimal spectral ranges (windows) is examined. The optimally identified wavelength bands derived from this method are tested using both simulations and experimental data. It is found that the proposed method achieves images as qualitatively accurate as using the full spectrum, but improves crosstalk between parameters.

Macrophages are immune cells that play a critical role in the promotion of cancer growth and configuration of the hepatic microenvironment. Studying intrahepatic macrophages is challenging because they are difficult to isolate, they transform their phenotype upon manipulation, and in vivo animal models poorly replicate the liver microenvironment. Understanding the complexity of intrahepatic macrophage populations is crucial because they coordinate antitumoral immunity. Application of novel methods that can detect immune cell phenotypes, along with their spatial co-localization in situ is critical and timely. The role of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is poorly understood. Most studies rely on platforms that remove intrahepatic macrophages from the microenvironment prior to evaluation. Cell isolation causes activation and phenotypic changes that may not represent their actual biology and function in situ. State-of-the-art methods provides new strategies to study TAMs without losing the context of tissue architecture and spatial relationship with neighboring cells. These technologies, such as multispectral imaging (e.g., Vectra Polaris), mass cytometry by time-of-flight (e.g., Fluidigm CyTOF), cycling of fluorochromes (e.g., Akoya Biosciences CODEX/PhenoCycler-Fusion, Bruker Canopy, Lunaphore Comet, and CyCIF) and digital spatial profiling or transcriptomics (e.g., GeoMx or Visium, Vizgen Merscope) are being utilized to accurately assess the complex cellular network within the tissue microenvironment. In cancer research, these platforms enable characterization of immune cell phenotypes and expression of potential therapeutic targets, such as PDL-1 and CTLA-4. Newer spatial profiling platforms allow for detection of numerous protein targets, in combination with whole transcriptome analysis, in a single liver biopsy tissue section. Macrophages can also be specifically targeted and analyzed, enabling quantification of both protein and gene expression within specific cell phenotypes, including TAMs. This review describes the workflow of each platform, summarizes recent research using these approaches, and explains the advantages and limitations of each.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "Expanding Multimodal Microscopy by High Spectral Resolution Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering Imaging for Clinical Disease Diagnostics", "abstract": "Over the past years fast label-free nonlinear imaging modalities providing molecular contrast of endogenous disease markers with subcellular spatial resolution have been emerged. However, applications of these imaging modalities in clinical settings are still at the very beginning. This is because single nonlinear imaging modalities such as second-harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) have only limited value for diagnosing diseases due to the small number of endogenous markers. Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy on the other hand can potentially be added to SHG and TPEF to visualize a much broader range of marker molecules. However, CARS requires a second synchronized laser source and the detection of a certain wavenumber range of the vibrational spectrum to differentiate multiple molecules, which results in increased experimental complexity and often inefficient excitation of SHG and TPEF signals.

It is not uncommon to have a diagnosis confirmed 5 to 10 years after the initial onset of symptoms. Development of a more-sensitive molecular imaging technology to detect structural changes in the joints would lead to earlier diagnosis and quantitative tracking of ankylosis progression. Progressive ankylosis (ank/ank) mice have a loss of function in the Ank gene, which codes for a regulator of PPi transport. In this study, we used these ank/ank mutant mice to assess a noninvasive, quantitative measure of joint ankylosis with near-infrared (NIR) molecular imaging in vivo. Methods: Three age groups (8, 12, and 18 weeks) of ank/ank (15 mice) and wild-type littermates (12 +/+ mice) were assessed histologically and radiographically. Before imaging, OsteoSense 750 (bisphosphonate pamidronate) was injected i.v. Whole-body images were analyzed by using the multispectral Maestro imaging system. Results: OsteoSense 750 signals in the paw joints were higher in ank/ank mice in all three age groups compared with controls. In the spine, significantly higher OsteoSense 750 signals were detected early, in 8-week-old ank/ank mice compared with controls, although minimal radiographic differences were noted at this time point. The molecular imaging changes in the ank/ank spine (8 weeks) were supported by histologic changes, including calcium apatite crystals at the edge of the vertebral bodies and new syndesmophyte formation. Conclusions: Changes in joint pathology of ank/ank mice, as evaluated by histologic and radiographic means, are qualitative, but only semiquantitative. In contrast, molecular imaging provides a quantitative assessment. Ankylosis in ank/ank mice developed simultaneously in distal and axial joints, contrary to the previous notion that it is a centripetal process.

Aim: To demonstrate the feasibility of visible spectral diffuse reflectance for in vivo monitoring of hemoglobin derivatives and evaluating methemoglobin production and reduction as well as hypoxemia during methemoglobinemia in rats. Approach: A new imaging approach based on the multiple regression analysis aided by Monte Carlo simulations for light transport was developed to quantify methemoglobin, oxygenated hemoglobin, and deoxygenated hemoglobin using a hyperspectral imaging system. An in vivo experiment with rats exposed to sodium nitrite (NaNO2) at different doses was performed to confirm the feasibility of the method for evaluating the dynamics of methemoglobin, oxygenated hemoglobin, and deoxygenated hemoglobin during methemoglobinemia. Systemic physiological parameters, including the percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation, heart rate (HR), and pulse distention, were measured by a commercially available pulse oximeter, and the results were compared to those obtained by the proposed method. Results: Both the methemoglobin concentration and methemoglobin saturation rapidly increased with a half-maximum time of <20 min. They reached their maximal values nearly 60 min after the administration of NaNO2. Tissue oxygen saturation dramatically dropped to a minimum of 33.7% +/- 0.4%, 23.1% +/- 5.6%, 8.8% +/- 1.7%, and 9.7% +/- 5.1% on average for NaNO2 doses of 25, 37.5, 50, and 75 mg/kg, respectively. Changes in methemoglobin concentration and tissue oxygen saturation are indicative of the temporary production of methemoglobin and severe hypoxemia during methemoglobinemia. Profound increases in the HR and pulse distention implied an elevated cardiac output caused by tachycardia and the resultant increase in peripheral blood volume to compensate for the hypoxia and hypoxemia during methemoglobinemia. This was in agreement with the time course of the peripheral hemoglobin volume concentration obtained by the proposed method. Conclusions: The proposed method is capable of the in vivo non-contact simultaneous evaluation of methemoglobin levels and hypoxemia during methemoglobinemia, and that it has potential as a tool for the diagnosis and management of methemoglobinemia.

Here, we are unique in presenting a murine ischemic wound model that is based on bipedicle flap approach. Using this model of ischemic wounds we have sought to elucidate how microRNAs may be implicated in limiting wound re-epithelialization under hypoxia, a major component of ischemia. Ischemia, evaluated by laser Doppler as well as hyperspectral imaging, limited blood flow and lowered tissue oxygen saturation. EPR oximetry demonstrated that the ischemic wound tissue had pO(2) < 10 mm Hg. Ischemic wounds suffered from compromised macrophage recruitment and delayed wound epithelialization. Specifically, epithelial proliferation, as determined by Ki67 staining, was compromised. In vivo imaging showed massive hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) stabilization in ischemic wounds, where HIF-1 alpha induced miR-210 expression that, in turn, silenced its target E2F3, which was markedly down-regulated in the wound-edge tissue of ischemic wounds. E2F3 was recognized as a key facilitator of cell proliferation. In keratinocytes, knock-down of E2F3 limited cell proliferation. Forced stabilization of HIF-1 alpha using Ad-VP16-HIF-1 alpha under normoxic conditions upregulated miR-210 expression, down-regulated E2F3, and limited cell proliferation. Studies using cellular delivery of miR-210 antagomir and mimic demonstrated a key role of miR-210 in limiting keratinocyte proliferation. In summary, these results are unique in presenting evidence demonstrating that the hypoxia component of ischemia may limit wound re-epithelialization by stabilizing HIF-1 alpha, which induces miR-210 expression, resulting in the down-regulation of the cell-cycle regulatory protein E2F3.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "Diagnostic prospects and preclinical development of optical technologies using gold nanostructure contrast agents to boost endogenous tissue contrast", "abstract": "Numerous developments in optical biomedical imaging research utilizing gold nanostructures as contrast agents have advanced beyond basic research towards demonstrating potential as diagnostic tools; some of which are translating into clinical applications.

Since, frequency combs have become common equipment for frequency metrology. In the last decade, novel applications for the optical frequency comb have been demonstrated beyond its original purpose. Broadband molecular spectroscopy is one of those. One such technique of molecular spectroscopy with frequency combs, dual-comb Fourier transform spectroscopy provides short measurement times with resolution and accuracy. Two laser frequency combs with slightly different repetition frequencies generate pairs of pulses with a linearly-scanned delay between pulses in a pair. The system without moving parts mimics a fast scanning Fourier transform interferometer. The measurement speed may be several orders of magnitude faster than that of a Michelson-based Fourier transform spectrometer, which opens up new opportunities for broadband molecular spectroscopy. Recently, dual-comb spectroscopy has been extended to nonlinear phenomena. A broadband Raman spectrum of molecular fingerprints may be measured within a few tens of microseconds with coherent Raman dual-comb spectroscopy.

Our results show tryptophan to be the dominant source of emission under 266 nm excitation, while emission from NADH and collagen are dominant under 355 nm excitation. The analysis of multispectral microscopy images reveals that tryptophan offers the highest image contrast due to its non-uniform distribution in the sub-cellular matrix.

Unique applications of this tool are reviewed with a focus on ultrasensitive detection of normal blood cells at different functional states (e.g., apoptotic and necrotic) and rare abnormal cells including circulating tumor cells (CTCs), cancer stem cells, pathogens, clots, sickle cells as well as pharmokinetics of nanoparticles, dyes, microbubbles and drug nanocarriers. Using this tool we discovered that palpation, biopsy, or surgery can enhance CTC release from primary tumors, increasing the risk of metastasis. The novel fluctuation flow cytometry provided the opportunity for the dynamic study of blood rheology including red blood cell aggregation and clot formation in different medical conditions (e.g., blood disorders, cancer, or surgery). Theranostics, as a combination of PA diagnosis and PT nanobubble-amplified multiplex therapy, was used for eradication of CTCs, purging of infected blood, and thrombolysis of clots using PA guidance to control therapy efficiency.

Development of new pO2 measurement modalities with simultaneous monitoring of pO2 in larger fields of view with higher spatial and/or temporal resolution will enable greater insight into the functioning of the normal brain and will also have significant impact on diagnosis and treatment of neurovascular diseases such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and head injury. Optical imaging modalities have shown a great potential to provide high spatiotemporal resolution and quantitative imaging of pO2 based on hemoglobin absorption in visible and near infrared range of optical spectrum. However, multispectral measurement of cerebral blood oxygenation relies on photon migration through the highly scattering brain tissue. Estimation and modeling of tissue optical parameters, which may undergo dynamic changes during the experiment, is typically required for accurate estimation of blood oxygenation. On the other hand, estimation of the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) based on oxygen-dependent quenching of phosphorescence should not be significantly affected by the changes in the optical parameters of the tissue and provides an absolute measure of pO2. Experimental systems that utilize oxygen-sensitive dyes have been demonstrated in in vivo studies of the perfused tissue as well as for monitoring the oxygen content in tissue cultures, showing that phosphorescence quenching is a potent technology capable of accurate oxygen imaging in the physiological pO2 range.

Although there are some research reports involving fluorescent probes for imaging NQO1 in vivo, they generally suffer from the strong light scattering by tissues which would cause the spatial resolution of fluorescent signals degrade rapidly with imaging depth. On the other hand, as an emerging detection and imaging modality, optoacoustic tomography (OAT) is capable of providing more detailed information in deep biological tissues than fluorescent imaging, since in OAT ultrasound signals are the reporting signals. To overcome the inherent defects of fluorescent imaging, in this work, we developed a novel near-infrared (NIR) NQO1-activatable optoacoustic (OA) probe TPA-X-Q based on the push-pull internal charge transfer (ICT) scaffold. TPA-X-Q consists of a NQO1-responsive moiety, quinone propionate group and a NIR chromophore TPA-X-OH. In the absence of the enzyme NQO1, the probe displays nearly no noticeable OA signal upon NIR excitation. Whereas in the presence of NQO1, the quinone propionate group of TPA-X-Q is reduced and cleaved by the enzymatic reaction triggered by NQO1, and thus TPA-X-Q is transformed into TPA-X-OH, consequently evident OA signal is generated, thereby realizing the detection and imaging of NQO1. As for the probe, the limit of detection (LOD) is determined to be 0.193 mu g.mL(-1). Furthermore, the probe TPA-X-Q displays several advantages, such as quite good selectivity towards NQO1, low cytotoxicity and excellent photostability. Moreover, the probe has been successfully utilized to detect and image the overexpressed NQO1 in the breast cancer-bearing mouse model. Orthogonal-view three-dimensional (3D) images can also be obtained by using multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), and thus precise localization of the breast cancer tumors can be achieved.

Total haemoglobin (THb) and oxygen saturation (SO2MSOT) were calculated. Pathological and biochemical evaluation of the tumour vascular phenotype was performed for validation. RESULTS: MCF-7 tumours show SO2 MSOT similar to healthy tissue in both rim and core, despite significantly lower THb in the core. MDA-MB-231 tumours show markedly lower SO2 MSOT with a significant rim-core disparity. Ex vivo analysis revealed that MCF-7 tumours contain fewer blood vessels (CD31+) that are more mature (CD31+/aSMA+) than MDA-MB-231. MCF-7 presented higher levels of stromal VEGF and iNOS, with increased NO serum levels.

However, the implementation of one or a small number of these advanced features in previous attempts for clinical translation has often introduced more tradeoffs than benefits. In this review, we outline a strategy that would integrate multiple advanced features to overcome all the technical barriers simultaneously, effectively reduce tradeoffs, and synergistically optimize CARS microscopy for clinical translation.

Functional changes in both maternal and embryo regions were studied at different gestation days when subjected to an oxygen breathing challenge and perfusion with indocyanine green. Structural phenotyping of the cross-sectional scans highlighted different internal organs, whereas multi-wavelength acquisitions enabled non-invasive label-free spectroscopic assessment of blood-oxygenation parameters in foeto-placental regions, rendering a strong correlation with the amount of oxygen administered.

In its advanced stages, CKD greatly increases the risk of hospitalization and death. Although kidney transplantation has revolutionized the care of advanced CKD, clinicians have limited ways of assessing donor kidney quality. Thus, optimal donor kidney-recipient matching cannot be performed, meaning that some patients receive damaged kidneys that function poorly. Fibrosis is a form of chronic damage often present in donor kidneys, and it is an important predictor of future renal function. Currently, no safe, easy-to-perform technique exists that accurately quantifies renal fibrosis. We describe a potentially novel photoacoustic (PA) imaging technique that directly images collagen, the principal component of fibrotic tissue. PA imaging noninvasively quantifies whole kidney fibrotic burden in mice, and cortical fibrosis in pig and human kidneys, with outstanding accuracy and speed. Remarkably, 3-dimensional PA imaging exhibited sufficiently high resolution to capture intrarenal variations in collagen content. We further show that PA imaging can be performed in a setting that mimics human kidney transplantation, suggesting the potential for rapid clinical translation. Taken together, our data suggest that PA collagen imaging is a major advance in fibrosis quantification that could have widespread preclinical and clinical impact.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "In Vivo Reflectance Confocal Microscopy of Gold Microparticles Deposited in the Skin.

The NIR system utilizes six optical wavelengths from 660 to 850 nm using intensity modulated diode lasers nominally working at 100 MHz. Photomultiplier tube detector gain levels are electronically controlled on a time scale of 200 ms, thereby allowing rapid switching of the source to locations around the tissue.

The authors systematically assessed the performance of the BLT system in terms of target localization and the ability to resolve two neighboring sources in simulations, tissue-mimicking phantom, and in vivo environments. Methods: Multispectral measurements acquired in a single projection were used for the BLT reconstruction. The incomplete variables truncated conjugate gradient algorithm with an iterative permissible region shrinking strategy was employed as the optimization scheme to reconstruct source distributions. Simulation studies were conducted for single spherical sources with sizes from 0.5 to 3 mm radius at depth of 3-12 mm. The same configuration was also applied for the double source simulation with source separations varying from 3 to 9 mm. Experiments were performed in a standalone BLT/CBCT system. Two self-illuminated sources with 3 and 4.7 mm separations placed inside a tissue-mimicking phantom were chosen as the test cases. Live mice implanted with single-source at 6 and 9 mm depth, two sources at 3 and 5 mm separation at depth of 5 mm, or three sources in the abdomen were also used to illustrate the localization capability of the BLT system for multiple targets in vivo. Results: For simulation study, approximate 1 mm accuracy can be achieved at localizing center of mass (CoM) for single-source and grouped CoM for double source cases. For the case of 1.5 mm radius source, a common tumor size used in preclinical study, their simulation shows that for all the source separations considered, except for the 3 mm separation at 9 and 12 mm depth, the two neighboring sources can be resolved at depths from 3 to 12 mm. Phantom experiments illustrated that 2D bioluminescence imaging failed to distinguish two sources, but BLT can provide 3D source localization with approximately 1 mm accuracy. The in vivo results are encouraging that 1 and 1.7 mm accuracy can be attained for the single-source case at 6 and 9 mm depth, respectively. For the 2 sources in vivo study, both sources can be distinguished at 3 and 5 mm separations, and approximately 1 mm localization accuracy can also be achieved. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that their multispectral BLT/CBCT system could be potentially applied to localize and resolve multiple sources at wide range of source sizes, depths, and separations. The average accuracy of localizing CoM for single-source and grouped CoM for double sources is approximately 1 mm except deep-seated target. The information provided in this study can be instructive to devise treatment margins for BLT-guided irradiation.

As an alternative, we propose Raman spectroscopy which is a non-destructive and label-free technique that allows continuous real-time monitoring of the tissue to study biological changes as they occur. By performing Raman spectroscopic measurements on purified insulin and glucagon, we showed that the 520 cm(-1) band assigned to disulfide bridges in insulin, and the 1552 cm(-1) band assigned to tryptophan in glucagon are mutually exclusive and could therefore be used as indirect markers for the label-free distinction between both hormones. High-resolution hyperspectral Raman imaging for these bands showed the distribution of disulfide bridges and tryptophan at sub-micrometer scale, which correlated with the location of insulin and glucagon as revealed by conventional immunohistochemistry. As a measure for this correlation, quantitative analysis was performed comparing the Raman images with the fluorescence images, resulting in Dice coefficients (ranging between 0 and 1) of 0.36 for insulin and 0.19 for glucagon.

Methods: A murine model for intravital microscopy of the breathing lung under sealed thorax conditions was combined with multispectral oximetry for two-dimensional oxygen saturation mapping. This combination allowed for visualization of the blood oxygenation process from pulmonary arterioles to capillaries and venules in two-dimensional oxygen saturation maps. Measurements and Main Results: Temporal and spatial oxygenation profiles revealed that oxygenation occurs within 100 milliseconds over a distance of approximately 130 mu m in the pulmonary microvasculature of the anesthetized mouse. About 50% of total oxygen uptake takes place in precapillary arterioles of less than 30 mm in diameter before the blood enters the alveolar capillary bed. In chronic hypoxic mice, precapillary oxygenation was significantly attenuated as a result of the widened transarteriolar diffusion distance.

Intra-arterial injection of specially designed liposomes may facilitate efficient delivery to the brain and to gliomas. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that cationic liposomes may be effectively delivered to both normal and glioma-bearing brain tissue utilizing a strategy of intra-arterial injection during transient cerebral hypoperfusion. METHODS: Cationic, anionic, and neutral liposomes were separately injected via the internal carotid artery of healthy rats during transient cerebral hypoperfusion. Rats bearing C6 gliomas were similarly injected with cationic liposomes. Liposomes were loaded with DilC(18)(5) dye whose concentrations can be measured by light absorbance and fluorescence methods. RESULTS: After intra-arterial injection, a robust uptake of cationic in comparison with anionic and neutral liposomes into brain parenchyma was observed by diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Postmortem multispectral fluorescence imaging revealed that liposomal cationic charge was associated with more efficient delivery to the brain. Cationic liposomes were also readily observed within glioma tissue after intra-arterial injection. However, over time, cationic liposomes were retained longer and at higher concentrations in the surrounding, peritumoral brain than in the tumor core.

In this review we discuss some of the primary advantages and disadvantages of IVM approaches and describe recent technological advances in optical microscopy (e.g., confocal microscopy, multiphoton microscopy, hyperspectral imaging, and optical coherence tomography) with examples of their application to studies of tumor angiogenesis.

In particular, nano-scaled carriers have revolutionalized drug delivery, allowing for therapeutic agents to be selectively targeted on an organ, tissue and cell specific level, also minimizing exposure of healthy tissue to drugs. In this review we discuss and analyze three issues, which are considered to be at the core of nano-scaled drug delivery systems, namely functionalization of nanocarriers, delivery to target organs and in vivo imaging. The latest developments on highly specific conjugation strategies that are used to attach biomolecules to the surface of nanoparticles (NP) are first reviewed. Besides drug carrying capabilities, the functionalization of nanocarriers also facilitate their transport to primary target organs. We highlight the leading advantage of nanocarriers, i.e. their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a tightly packed layer of endothelial cells surrounding the brain that prevents high-molecular weight molecules from entering the brain. The BBB has several transport molecules such as growth factors, insulin and transferrin that can potentially increase the efficiency and kinetics of brain-targeting nanocarriers. Potential treatments for common neurological disorders, such as stroke, tumours and Alzheimer's, are therefore a much sought-after application of nanomedicine. Likewise any other drug delivery system, a number of parameters need to be registered once functionalized NPs are administered, for instance their efficiency in organ-selective targeting, bioaccumulation and excretion. Finally, direct in vivo imaging of nanomaterials is an exciting recent field that can provide real-time tracking of those nanocarriers. We review a range of systems suitable for in vivo imaging and monitoring of drug delivery, with an emphasis on most recently introduced molecular imaging modalities based on optical and hybrid contrast, such as fluorescent protein tomography and multispectral optoacoustic tomography. Overall, great potential is foreseen for nanocarriers in medical diagnostics, therapeutics and molecular targeting. A proposed roadmap for ongoing and future research directions is therefore discussed in detail with emphasis on the development of novel approaches for functionalization, targeting and imaging of nano-based drug delivery systems, a cutting-edge technology poised to change the ways medicine is administered.", "db": "wos"}, {"title": "Micro-Raman spectroscopy of lipid halo and dense-core amyloid plaques: aging process characterization in the Alzheimer's disease APPswePS1 Delta E9 mouse model", "abstract": "The deposition of amyloid plaques is considered one of the main microscopic features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since plaque formation can precede extensive neurodegeneration and it is the main clinical manifestation of AD, it constitutes a relevant target for new treatment and diagnostic approaches. Micro-Raman spectroscopy, a label-free technique, is an accurate method for amyloid plaque identification and characterization. Here, we present a high spatial resolution micro-Raman hyperspectral study in transgenic APPswePS1 Delta E9 mouse brains, showing details of AD tissue biochemical and histological changes without staining. First we used stimulated micro-Raman scattering to identify the lipid-rich halo surrounding the amyloid plaque, and then proceeded with spontaneous (conventional) micro-Raman spectral mapping, which shows a cholesterol and sphingomyelin lipid-rich halo structure around dense-core amyloid plaques. The detailed images of this lipid halo relate morphologically well with dystrophic neurites surrounding plaques. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the micro-Raman hyperspectral data indicates the feasibility of the optical biomarkers of AD progression with the potential for discriminating transgenic groups of young adult mice (6-month-old) from older ones (12-month-old).

However, a key obstacle to cell therapy's success is the loss of engrafted cells due to apoptosis or necrosis in the ischemic myocardium. While many strategies have been developed to improve engrafted cell survival, tools to evaluate cell efficacy within the body are limited. Traditional genetic labeling tools, such as GFP-like fluorescent proteins (eGFP, DsRed, mCherry), have limited penetration depths in vivo due to tissue scattering and absorption. To circumvent these limitations, a near-infrared fluorescent mutant of the DrBphP bacteriophytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans, IFP1.4, was developed for in vivo imaging, but it has yet to be used for in vivo stem/progenitor cell tracking. In this study, we incorporated IFP1.4 into mouse cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) by a lentiviral vector. Live IFP1.4-labeled CPCs were imaged by their near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) using an Odyssey scanner following overnight incubation with biliverdin. A significant linear correlation was observed between the amount of cells and NIRF signal intensity in in vitro studies. Lentiviral mediated IFP1.4 gene labeling is stable, and does not impact the apoptosis and cardiac differentiation of CPC. To assess efficacy of our model for engrafted cells in vivo, IFP1.4-labeled CPCs were intramyocardially injected into infarcted hearts. NIRF signals were collected at 1-day, 7-days, and 14-days post-injection using the Kodak in vivo multispectral imaging system. Strong NIRF signals from engrafted cells were imaged 1 day after injection. At 1 week after injection, 70% of the NIRF signal was lost when compared to the intensity of the day 1 signal.

R-2, , vessel density (Q), and relative vascular volume fractions (VVF) were estimated in both normal tissue and tumor, and compared with model-derived theoretical and experimental estimates based on preclinical murine xenograft data. Results R-2 and relaxation rates were still significantly elevated in tumors and liver 48h after ferumoxytol injection; liver values returned to baseline by week 2. Q was relatively insensitive to changes in , indicating lack of dependence on contrast agent concentration. Variability in Q was higher among human tumors compared with xenografts and was mostly driven by R-2. Relative VVFs were higher in human tumors compared with xenografts, while values in muscle were similar between species.

Data extracted from the reports comprised details about system design, phantom studies, and clinical studies. Five prototypes were included. System designs comprised planar, hemicylindrical and hemispherical geometries. In total, 52 of 61 breast cancers (85 %) were detected by three of the prototypes, showing image details such as ring-pattern of the haemoglobin-rich tumour vasculature. A refined prototype provided submillimetre resolution at a good contrast-to-noise ratio up to a depth of about 5 cm in a cup-shaped breast configuration. Another novel prototype demonstrated that in the mammographic imaging geometry, the total imaging depth approximately duplicates with bilateral laser illumination. Most prototypes focused on detecting elevated haemoglobin content related to tumours, but proof-of-principle was also given for multispectral optoacoustic tomography by additional imaging of tissue oxygenation.

Adult C57BL/6 mice were exposed via single intratracheal instillations to free forms of TiO(2)NPs (10, 20.6, or 38 nm in diameter) with different surface coatings, or TiO(2)NPs embedded in paint matrices. Controls were exposed to dispersion medium devoid of NPs. TiO(2)NPs were characterized for size, surface area, chemical impurities, and agglomeration state in the exposure medium. Pulmonary transcriptional profiles were generated using microarrays from tissues collected one and 28 d postexposure. Property-specific pathway effects were identified. Pulmonary protein levels of specific inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were confirmed by ELISA. The data were collapsed to 659 differentially expressed genes (P 0.05; fold change 1.5). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of these genes revealed that TiO(2)NPs clustered mainly by postexposure timepoint followed by particle type. A pathway-based meta-analysis showed that the combination of smaller size, large deposited surface area, and surface amidation contributes to TiO2NP gene expression response. Embedding of TiO2NP in paint dampens the overall transcriptional effects. The magnitude of the expression changes associated with pulmonary inflammation differed across all particles; however, the underlying pathway perturbations leading to inflammation were similar, suggesting a generalized mechanism-of-action for all TiO(2)NPs. Thus, transcriptional profiling is an effective tool to determine the property-specific biological/toxicity responses induced by nanomaterials. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 56:245-264, 2015.

To enable quantitative clinical spectroscopy, the fundamental issues of wavelength-dependent fluence variations and inter-wavelength motion must be overcome. Here we propose a real-time, spectroscopic photoacoustic/ultrasound (PAUS) imaging approach using a compact, 1-kHz rate wavelength-tunable laser. Instead of illuminating tissue over a large area, the fiber-optic delivery system surrounding an US array sequentially scans a narrow laser beam, with partial PA image reconstruction for each laser pulse. The final image is then formed by coherently summing partial images. This scheme enables (i) automatic compensation for wavelength-dependent fluence variations in spectroscopic PA imaging and (ii) motion correction of spectroscopic PA frames using US speckle tracking in real-time systems. The 50-Hz video rate PAUS system is demonstrated in vivo using a murine model of labelled drug delivery.

Scaffolding cells in hydrogels is known to protect cells from such immediate death by shielding them from mechanical damage and by averting an immune attack after transplantation. Implanted hydrogels must eventually degrade and facilitate a safe integration of the graft with the surrounding host tissue. Hence, serial monitoring of hydrogel degradation in vivo is pivotal to optimize hydrogel compositions and overall therapeutic efficacy of the graft.

By individually labeling Gel-S and HA-S with two distinct near-infrared (NIR) dyes, multispectral monitoring of the relative degradation of the components can be used for long-term validation of the CEST MRI findings. \u00a9 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Multi-wavelength fluorescence imaging with a da Vinci Firefly\u2014a technical look behind the scenes", "abstract": "The field of fluorescence-guided surgery builds on colored fluorescent tracers that have become available for different clinical applications.

The aim of the study was to visualize and quantify murine renal vasculature using label-free raster scanning optoacoustic mesoscopy (RSOM) in explanted organs from mice with renal injury. Material and methods: For the experiments, freshly bisected kidneys of alpha 8 integrin knock-out (KO) and wildtype mice (WT) were used. A total of n=7 female (n=4 KO, n=3 WT) and n=6 male animals (n=2 KO, n=4 WT) aged 6 weeks were examined with RSOM optoacoustic imaging systems (RSOM Explorer P50 at SWL 532nm and/or ms-P50 imaging system at 532 nm, 555 nm, 579 nm, and 606 nm). Images were reconstructed using a dedicated software, analyzed for size and vascular area and compared to standard histologic sections. Results: RSOM enabled mapping of murine kidney size and vascular area, revealing differences between kidney sizes of male (m) and female (f) mice (merged frequencies (MF) f vs. m: 52.42\u00b16.24 mm2 vs. 69.18\u00b115.96 mm2, p=0.0156) and absolute vascular area (MF f vs. m: 35.67\u00b14.22 mm2 vs. 49.07\u00b113.48 mm2, p=0.0036). Without respect to sex, the absolute kidney area was found to be smaller in knock-out (KO) than in wildtype (WT) mice (WT vs. KO: MF: p=0.0255) and showed a similar trend for the relative vessel area (WT vs. KO: MF p=0.0031). Also the absolute vessel areas of KO compared to WT were found significantly different (MF p=0.0089). A significant decrease in absolute vessel area was found in KO compared to WT male mice (MF WT vs. KO: 54.37\u00b19.35 mm2 vs. 34.93\u00b113.82 mm2, p=0.0232). In addition, multispectral RSOM allowed visualization of oxygenated and deoxygenated parenchymal regions by spectral unmixing.

In this study, CDK4/6-dependent and -resistant models were employed to identify functional determinants of response to pharmacologic CDK4/6 inhibitors. In all models tested, the activation of RB and inhibition of CDK2 activity emerged as determinants of sensitivity. While depleting CDK4 and 6 was sufficient to limit proliferation in specific resistance settings, RB loss rendered cells completely independent of these kinases. The main downstream target in this context was the activation status of CDK2, which was suppressed with CDK4/6 inhibition in an RB-dependent fashion. Protein levels of p27 were associated with plasticity/rigidity of the cell cycle and correlated with sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibition. Exogenous overexpression and pharmacologic induction of p27 via inhibition of SKP2 and targeting the MEK/ERK pathway enhanced the cytostatic effect of CDK4/6 inhibitors. Mice bearing ER\u00fe xenografts displayed a durable antitumor response to palbociclib; however, over the course of treatment, few cells retained RB phosphorylation, which was associated with limited p27 protein levels as determined by multispectral imaging. Similarly, combination treatment of palbociclib with a MEK inhibitor in pancreatic cancer PDX models upregulated p27 and further enhanced the in vivo tumor response to palbociclib. Collectively, these results suggest that the cell cycle plasticity, which enables tumor models to evade palbociclib-mediated activation of RB, could be targeted using a clinically applicable CDK2 inhibitor. Significance: This work provides a mechanistic insight toward understanding the functional roles of multiple cell cycle regulators that drive plasticity and sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibition. \u00a92020 American Association for Cancer Research.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Optical Biopsy XIX: Toward Real-Time Spectroscopic Imaging and Diagnosis", "abstract": "The proceedings contain 6 papers.

Among the many applications of HSI in the medical field are the detection of various types of tumors and the evaluation of their blood flow, as well as the healing processes of grafts and wounds. Since tumor perfusion is one of the critical factors in oncology, we assessed the value of HSI in quantifying perfusion changes during interventions in clinical oncology through a systematic review of the literature. Materials and methods: The PubMed and Web of Science electronic databases were searched using the terms \"hyperspectral imaging perfusion cancer\"and \"hyperspectral imaging resection cancer\". The inclusion criterion was the use of HSI in clinical oncology, meaning that all animal, phantom, ex vivo, experimental, research and development, and purely methodological studies were excluded. Results: Twenty articles met the inclusion criteria. The anatomic locations of the neoplasms in the selected articles were as follows: kidneys (1 article), breasts (2 articles), eye (1 article), brain (4 articles), entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract (1 article), upper GI tract (5 articles), and lower GI tract (6 articles). Conclusions: HSI is a potentially attractive imaging modality for clinical application in oncology, with assessment of mastectomy skin flap perfusion after reconstructive breast surgery and anastomotic perfusion during reconstruction of gastrointenstinal conduit as the most promising at present.  \u00a9 2022 Rok Hren, Gregor Sersa, Urban Simoncic, Matija Milanic, published by Sciendo.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Biomedical Spectroscopy, Microscopy, and Imaging II", "abstract": "The proceedings contain 24 papers.

One explanation may be differences in blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity compared to high-grade glioma. The authors hypothesized that for a BBB semipermeable to 5-ALA there might be a relationship between plasma 5-ALA concentration and its movement into the brain. A higher dose would elicit more 5-ALA conversion into protoporphyrin IX (PPIX). The authors present a case series of patients harboring LGG who received higher doses of 5-ALA. METHODS Patients undergoing surgery for indeterminate glioma later diagnosed as LGG were included in this study. 5-ALA was administered at a standard dose of 20 mg/kg body weight (bw) 4 hours prior to induction of anesthesia. A subgroup of patients received a higher dose of 40 mg/kg bw. Fluorescence was evaluated visually and PPIX concentration (cPPIX) was determined ex vivo by hyperspectral measurements in freshly extracted tissue. All adverse events were recorded. RESULTS A total of 23 patients harboring diffuse low-grade astrocytomas (n = 19) and oligodendrogliomas (n = 4) were analyzed. Thirteen patients received 20 mg/kg bw, and 10 patients received 40 mg/kg bw of 5-ALA. In the 20 mg/kg group, 30.8% (4 of 13) of tumors harbored areas of visible fluorescence, compared to 60% of cases (n = 6 of 10) with 40 mg/kg bw. The threshold to visibility was 1 \u03bcg/ml in both groups. Measured over all biopsies, the mean cPPIX was significantly higher in the double-dose group (1.8 vs 0.45 \u03bcg/ml; p < 0.001). In non-visibly fluorescent tissue the mean cPPIX was 0.146 \u03bcg/ml in the 20 mg/kg and 0.347 \u03bcg/ml in the 40 mg/kg group, indicating an increase of 138% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS These observations demonstrate different regions with different levels of PPIX accumulation in LGG. With higher 5-ALA doses cPPIX increases, leading to more regions surpassing the visibility threshold of 1 \u03bcg/ml. These observations can be explained by the fact that the BBB in LGG is semipermeable to 5-ALA. Higher 5-ALA doses result in more PPIX conversion, an observation with implications for future dosing in LGG. \u00a9 AANS 2022.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Gasdermin D: in vivo evidence of pyroptosis in spontaneous labor at term", "abstract": "Objective: Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of programmed cell death that is mediated by the activation of the inflammasome and depends on the pore-forming function of gasdermin D. Therefore, the detection of gasdermin D represents in vivo evidence of pyroptosis. We recently showed that there is intra-amniotic inflammasome activation in spontaneous labor at term; however, evidence of pyroptosis is lacking. The objectives of this study were to investigate (1) whether gasdermin D is detectable in the amniotic fluid of women who delivered at term; (2) whether amniotic fluid gasdermin D concentrations are associated with the process of spontaneous labor at term; and (3) whether gasdermin D is expressed in the chorioamniotic membranes from these patients. Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study included amniotic fluid samples from 41 women who underwent spontaneous labor at term (n = 17) or delivered at term without labor (n = 24). As a readout of pyroptosis, gasdermin D was determined in amniotic fluid samples using a specific and sensitive ELISA kit. The 90th percentile of amniotic fluid gasdermin D concentrations was calculated among women without spontaneous labor at term (reference group). The association between high amniotic fluid gasdermin D concentrations (\u226590th percentile in the reference group) and spontaneous labor at term was tested using the Fisher\u2019s exact test. A p value <.05 was considered significant. Multiplex immunofluorescence staining and phenoptics (multispectral imaging) were performed to determine gasdermin D expression in the chorioamniotic membranes and to colocalize this protein with the inflammasome-related molecules caspase-1 and interleukin-1\u03b2. Results: (1) Gasdermin D is present in the amniotic fluid of women who delivered at term; (2) the 90th percentile of amniotic fluid gasdermin D concentrations in women who delivered at term without spontaneous labor was 3.4 ng/mL; (3) the proportion of women with amniotic fluid gasdermin D concentrations above the threshold was higher in those who underwent term labor than in those who delivered at term without labor; (4) amniotic fluid concentrations of gasdermin D > 3.4 ng/mL were significantly associated with the presence of spontaneous labor in women who delivered at term (odds ratio 6.0, p-value.048); and (5) the protein expression of gasdermin D is increased in the chorioamniotic membranes of women who underwent spontaneous labor at term and is colocalized with caspase-1 and IL-1\u03b2. Conclusions: Gasdermin D is increased in the amniotic fluid and chorioamniotic membranes of women who underwent spontaneous labor at term compared to those without labor. These data provide evidence implicating pyroptosis in the mechanisms that lead to the sterile inflammatory process of term parturition. \u00a9 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "cGAS deficiency enhances inflammasome activation in macrophages and inflammatory pathology in pristane-induced lupus", "abstract": "Introduction: Type I interferon (IFN) plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Cyclic GMP AMP synthase (cGAS) is a cytosolic DNA sensor that recognizes dsDNA and creates cGAMP to activate STING-mediated type I IFN production. The activation of STING induces lupus disease in Fcgr2b deficient mice through the differentiation of dendritic cells. In contrast, Cgas-deficient mice could be generated more autoantibody production and proteinuria in pristane-induced lupus (PIL). These data suggested that the other dsDNA sensors could be involved in lupus development mechanisms. Methods: This study aimed to identify the cGAS-mediated mechanisms contributing to lupus pathogenesis in PIL. The Cgas-deficient and WT mice were induced lupus disease with pristane and subsequently analyzed autoantibody, histopathology, and immunophenotypes. The lung tissues were analyzed with the expression profiles by RT-PCR and western blot. The bone marrow-derived macrophages were stimulated with inflammasome activators and observed pyroptosis. Results: The Cgas-/- mice developed more severe pulmonary hemorrhage and autoantibody production than WT mice. The activated dendritic cells, IFN-g-, and IL-17a-producing T helper cells, and infiltrated macrophages in the lung were detected in Cgas-/- mice higher than in WT mice. We observed an increase in expression of Aim2, Casp11, and Ifi16 in the lung and serum IL-1a but IL-1b in pristane-injected Cgas-/- mice. The rise of Caspase-11 in the lung of pristane-injected Cgas-/- mice suggested noncanonical inflammasome activation. The activation of AIM2 and NLRP3 inflammasomes in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) enhanced the number of dead cells in Cgas-/- mice compared with WT mice. Activation of the inflammasome significantly induced pyroptosis in Cgas-/- BMDMs. The dsDNA level, but not mitochondrial DNA, increased dramatically in pristane-injected Cgas-/- mice suggesting the dsDNA could be a ligand activating inflammasomes. The cGAS agonist-induced BMDM activation in the Cgas-/- mice indicated that the activation of DNA sensors other than cGAS enhanced activated macrophages. Conclusion: These findings suggested that cGAS hampers the unusual noncanonical inflammasome activation through other DNA sensors.

Targeting strategies that integrate effective RAM regulation with imaging-based monitoring could lead to improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of RA. Here, we report the combined use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAsT/I) and Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) to silence the expression of proinflammatory cytokines TNF\u03b1/IL-6 and scavenge the ROS associated with RAM. To enhance the in vitro and in vivo biological stability, biocompatibility, and targeting capability of the siRNAsT/I and PBNPs, macrophage membrane vesicles were used to prepare biomimetic nanoparticles, M@P-siRNAsT/I. The resulting constructs were found to suppress tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1/ interleukin-6 expression and overcome the hypoxic nature of RAM, thus alleviating RA-induced joint damage in a mouse model. The M@P-siRNAsT/I of this study could be monitored via near-infrared photoacoustic (PA) imaging. Moreover, multispectral PA imaging without the need for labeling permitted the real-time evaluation of M@P-siRNAsT/I as a putative RA treatment. Clinical microcomputed tomography and histological analysis confirmed the effectiveness of the treatment. We thus suggest that macrophage-biomimetic M@P-siRNAsT/I and their analogs assisted by PA imaging could provide a new strategy for RA diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring.

Tissue samples taken during surgery are either subject to a preliminary intraoperative histological analysis, or sent for a full pathological evaluation which can take days or weeks. Whereas a lengthy complete pathological analysis includes an array of techniques to be executed, a preliminary tissue analysis on frozen tissue is performed as quickly as possible (30-45 minutes on average) to provide fast feedback to the surgeon during the surgery. The surgeon uses the information to confirm that the resected tissue is indeed tumor and may, at least in theory, initiate repeated biopsies to help achieve gross total resection. However, due to the total turn-around time of the tissue inspection for repeated analyses, this approach may not be feasible during a single surgery. In this context, intraoperative image-guided techniques can improve the clinical workflow for tumor resection and improve outcome by aiding in the identification and removal of the malignant lesion. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an optical imaging technique with the potential to extract combined spectral-spatial information. By exploiting HSI for human brain-tissue classification in 13 in-vivo hyperspectral images from 9 patients, a brain-tissue classifier is developed. The framework consists of a hybrid 3D-2D CNN-based approach and a band-selection step to enhance the capability of extracting both spectral and spatial information from the hyperspectral images. An overall accuracy of 77% was found when tumor, normal and hyper-vascularized tissue are classified, which clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches (SVM, 2D-CNN). These results may open an attractive future perspective for intraoperative brain-tumor classification using HSI.  \u00a9 2021 SPIE.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Multispectral tissue mapping: Developing a concept for the optical evaluation of liver disease", "abstract": "Purpose: Alterations in the optical absorption behavior of liver tissue secondary to pathological processes can be evaluated by multispectral analysis, which is increasingly being explored as an imaging adjunct for use in liver surgery. Current methods are either invasive or have a limited wavelength spectrum, which restricts utility. This proof of concept study describes the development of a multispectral imaging (MSI) method called multispectral tissue mapping (MTM) that addresses these issues. Approach: The imaging system consists of a tunable excitation light source and a near-infrared camera. Following the development stage, proof of concept experiments are carried out where absorption spectra from colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver steatosis specimen are acquired and compared to controls. Absorption spectra are compared to histopathology examination as the current gold standard for tissue assessment. Generalized linear mixed modeling is employed to compare absorption characteristics of individual pixels and to select wavelengths for false color image processing with the aim of visually enhancing cancer tissue. Results: Analysis of individual pixels revealed distinct absorption spectra therefore suggesting that MTM is possible. A prominent absorption peak at 1210 nm was found in lipid-rich animal tissues and steatotic liver specimen. Liver cancer tissue had a heterogeneous appearance on MSI. Subsequent statistical analysis suggests that measuring changes in absorption behavior may be a feasible method to estimate the pixel-based probability of cancer being present. In CRLM, this was observed throughout 1100 to 1700 nm, whereas in HCC it was concentrated around 1140 and 1430 nm. False color image processing visibly enhances contrast between cancer and normal liver tissues. Conclusions: The system's ability to enable no-touch MSI at 1100 to 1700 nm was demonstrated. Preliminary data suggest that MTM warrants further exploration as a potential imaging tool for the detection of liver cancer during surgery.  \u00a9 The Authors.

We acquired a hyper-spectral data cube of each patient with wavelengths ranging from 450 to 650 nm at an internal of 2 nm, followed by quantitative analysis of the spectral contribution of three known ingredients in skin tissues: Oxy-hemoglobin(HbO2), deoxy-hemoglobin(Hb) and melanin using an Independent Component Correlation Algorithm (ICA) method.

The synthesis and preliminary evaluation in cellulo of KcapTR488 for monitoring cell death by fluorescence imaging has been previously reported, but its utility in vivo has yet to be tested or validated. Herein, in vitro solution experiments verified the intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the two fluorophores and enabled a quantitative analysis of enzyme rates and selectivity. The sensor delivery kinetics in live rat models were quantified by ex vivo fluorescence microscopy. Studies in healthy control retinas demonstrated that KcapTR488 concentrated in the nucleus of retinal ganglion cells (RGC), with a strong colocalization of red and green fluorescence signals producing robust FRET signals, indicating an intact reporter. By contrast, using an acute but mild NMDA-induced retinal injury model, dual-color confocal ex vivo microscopy of cleaved KcapTR488 identified sensor activation as early as 2 h after injection. Quantitative changes in fluorescence colocalization were superior to changes in FRET for monitoring injury progression. Longitudinal monitoring revealed that the NLS-Texas Red fragment of the cleaved sensor moved out of the cell body, down the axon, and exited the retina, consistent with anterograde axonal transport. Thus, KcapTR488 may be a powerful tool to study RGC death pathways in live preclinical models of glaucoma. \u00a9 2022 by the authors.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Partial MCT1 invalidation protects against diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and the associated brain dysfunction", "abstract": "Background & Aims: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been associated with mild cerebral dysfunction and cognitive decline, although the exact pathophysiological mechanism remains ambiguous. Using a diet-induced model of NAFLD and monocarboxylate transporter-1 (Mct1+/\u2212) haploinsufficient mice, which resist high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis, we investigated the hypothesis that NAFLD leads to an encephalopathy by altering cognition, behaviour, and cerebral physiology. We also proposed that global MCT1 downregulation offers cerebral protection. Methods: Behavioural tests were performed in mice following 16 weeks of control diet (normal chow) or high-fat diet with high fructose/glucose in water. Tissue oxygenation, cerebrovascular reactivity, and cerebral blood volume were monitored under anaesthesia by multispectral optoacoustic tomography and optical fluorescence. Cortical mitochondrial oxygen consumption and respiratory capacities were measured using ex vivo high-resolution respirometry. Microglial and astrocytic changes were evaluated by immunofluorescence and 3D reconstructions. Body composition was assessed using EchoMRI, and liver steatosis was confirmed by histology. Results: NAFLD concomitant with obesity is associated with anxiety- and depression-related behaviour. Low-grade brain tissue hypoxia was observed, likely attributed to the low-grade brain inflammation and decreased cerebral blood volume. It is also accompanied by microglial and astrocytic morphological and metabolic alterations (higher oxygen consumption), suggesting the early stages of an obesogenic diet-induced encephalopathy. Mct1 haploinsufficient mice, despite fat accumulation in adipose tissue, were protected from NAFLD and associated cerebral alterations. Conclusions: This study provides evidence of compromised brain health in obesity and NAFLD, emphasising the importance of the liver\u2013brain axis. The protective effect of Mct1 haploinsufficiency points to this protein as a novel therapeutic target for preventing and/or treating NAFLD and the associated brain dysfunction. Impact and implications: This study is focused on unravelling the pathophysiological mechanism by which cerebral dysfunction and cognitive decline occurs during NAFLD and exploring the potential of monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT1) as a novel preventive or therapeutic target. Our findings point to NAFLD as a serious health risk and its adverse impact on the brain as a potential global health system and economic burden. These results highlight the utility of Mct1 transgenic mice as a model for NAFLD and associated brain dysfunction and call for systematic screening by physicians for early signs of psychological symptoms, and an awareness by individuals at risk of these potential neurological effects.

Methods: The accuracy of T1 and T2 measurements was evaluated with 2 coils [head and neck unit (HNU) and BODY coils] on phantoms using descriptive statistics and Bland\u2013Altman analysis. The reproducibility and repeatability of T1 and T2 measurements were performed on 15 sessions with the HNU coil. The T1 and T2 synthetic sequences obtained by both methods were evaluated according to quality assurance (QA) requirements for radiotherapy. T1 and T2 in vivo measurements of the brain or prostate tissues of two groups of five subjects were also compared. Results: The phantom results showed good agreement (mean bias, 8.4%) between the two measurement methods for T1 values between 490 and 2,385\u00a0ms and T2 values between 25 and 400\u00a0ms. MAGiC\u00ae gave discordant results for T1 values below 220\u00a0ms (bias with the reference values, from 38% to 1,620%). T2 measurements were accurately estimated below 400\u00a0ms (mean bias, 8.5%) by both methods. The QA assessments are in agreement with the recommendations of imaging for contouring purposes for radiotherapy planning. On patient data of the brain and prostate, the measurements of T1 and T2 by the two quantitative MRI (qMRI) methods were comparable (max difference, <7%).

In this work, we propose a classification method for in-vivo hyperspectral brain images to identify areas affected by glioblastomas based on nonlinear spectral unmixing. This methodology follows a semi-supervised approach for the estimation of the end-members in a multi-linear model. To improve the classification results, we vary the number of end-members per-class to address spectral variability of each studied type of tissue. Once the set of end-members is obtained, the classification map is generated according to the end-member with the highest abundance in each pixel, followed by morphological operations to smooth the resulting maps. The classification results demonstrate that the proposed methodology generates high performance in the regions of interest, with an accuracy above 0.75 and 0.96 in the inter and intra-patient strategies, respectively.

To reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies, we explored the use of multiparametric photoacoustic (PA) analysis in combination with the American Thyroid Association (ATA) Guideline (ATAP). In this study, we performed in vivo multispectral PA imaging on thyroid nodules from 52 patients, comprising 23 papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and 29 benign cases. From the multispectral PA data, we calculated hemoglobin oxygen saturation level in the nodule area, then classified the PTC and benign nodules with multiparametric analysis. Statistical analyses showed that this multiparametric analysis of multispectral PA responses could classify PTC nodules. Combining the photoacoustically indicated probability of PTC and the ATAP led to a new scoring method that achieved a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 93%. This study is the first multiparametric analysis of multispectral PA data of thyroid nodules with statistical significance. As a proof of concept, the results show that the proposed new ATAP scoring can help physicians examine thyroid nodules for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, thus reducing unnecessary biopsies. \u00a9 2021 American Association for Cancer Research Inc..

Conclusions: A clinical hyperspectral AF camera, with properly chosen excitation wavelengths in the blue range and a hyperspectral AF detector, should be capable of detecting and quantifying drusen and sub-RPE deposits, the earliest known lesions of AMD, before any other currently available imaging modality. \u00a9 2021 AME Publishing Company.

However, their clinical translation has been limited by the requirement of prohibitively high therapeutic doses due to their lack of specificity in delivery and, consequently, short systemic half-life. To overcome these challenges, we engineered a platform for modifying exosomes with an active targeting modality composed of membrane Anchor (BODIPY)-Spacer (PEG)-targeting Ligands (cyclic RGD peptide) (ASL). Herein, we show that the intramembrane incorporation of a trackable, targeting system renders ASL exosomes (AExs) a modular platform. AExs significantly overcome challenges associated with exosome modification, including potential damage for functionalization, or destabilizing interactions between dyes and drugs. ASL-modification not only enhanced stability in imparting active targeting but also introduced a built-in bioimaging modality. Our studies show that AExs target B16F10 melanoma tumor sites by the specific interaction of cyclic RGD and integrin. Doxorubicin encapsulated AExs (dAExs) significantly inhibited the growth of melanoma in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we conclude that ASL-modification allows exosomes to be transformed into a novel therapeutic vehicle uniquely integrating in vivo tracking and robust targeting with drug delivery. We anticipate that the therapeutic, targeting, and diagnostic modularity provided by ASL will potentiate translational applications of exosome-based vehicles beyond anticancer therapy.  \u00a9 ", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Molecular-Guided Surgery: Molecules, Devices, and Applications VII", "abstract": "The proceedings contain 10 papers.

Specifically covered themes are fluorescence imaging, nonlinear optical imaging, photoacoustic imaging, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and hyperspectral imaging. The review first discusses light propagation and bio-optics of processes of light absorption, scattering and transmission in biological media. It describes the various biological spectral windows of maximum optical transparencies which are suitable for optical imaging. Then, we introduce the different optical imaging modalities and their features in bioimaging both in vitro and in vivo. The role of molecular and nano-probes to serve as contrast agents for different modalities of imaging is described. A unique aspect also discussed in this review is the physics of manipulation of excitation dynamics that can make them selectively nanoemitters for fluorescence imaging; nonlinear optical probes for imaging; nano-photothermal heaters and nanothermometry for photoacoustic imaging; and nanoscatterers for OCT.

However, monitoring the size of the resulting tissue damage during the thermal removal procedures is a challenging task. The objective of this study was to evaluate the observation of RFA on an ex vivo liver sample with both a commercial and a low-cost system to distinguish between the normal and the ablated regions as well as the thermally affected regions. RFA trials were conducted on five different ex vivo normal bovine samples and monitored initially by a custom hyperspectral (HS) camera to measure the diffuse reflectance (Rd ) utilising a polychromatic light source (tungsten halogen lamp) within the spectral range 348\u2013950 nm. Next, the light source was replaced with monochromatic LEDs (415, 565 and 660 nm) and a commercial charge-coupled device (CCD) camera was used instead of the HS camera. The system algorithm comprises image enhancement (normalisation and moving average filter) and image segmentation with K-means clustering, combining spectral and spatial information to assess the variable responses to polychromatic light and monochromatic LEDs to highlight the differences in the Rd properties of thermally affected/normal tissue regions. The measured spectral signatures of the various regions, besides the calculation of the standard deviations (\u03b4) between the generated six groups, guided us to select three optimal wavelengths (420, 540 and 660 nm) to discriminate between these various regions. Next, we selected six spectral images to apply the image processing to (at 450, 500, 550, 600, 650 and 700 nm). We noticed that the optimum image is the superimposed spectral images at 550, 600, 650 and 700 nm, which are capable of discriminating between the various regions. Later, we measured Rd with the CCD camera and commercially available monochromatic LED light sources at 415, 565 and 660 nm. Compared to the HS camera results, this system was more capable of identifying the ablated and the thermally affected regions of surface RFA than the side-penetration RFA of the investigated ex vivo liver samples. However, we succeeded in developing a low-cost system that provides satisfactory information to highlight the ablated and thermally affected region to improve the outcome of surgical tumour ablation with much shorter time for image capture and processing compared to the HS system. \u00a9 2021 The Authors.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Simulated Annealing-Based Wavelength Selection for Robust Tissue Oxygenation Estimation Powered by the Extended Modified Lambert\u2013Beer Law", "abstract": "In this paper, we present a set of algorithms to enable the development of inexpensive hyperspectral sensors capable of estimating tissue oxygenation for wound monitoring.

These indicators rely on the spectral variation of temperature-dependent tissue chromophores, i.e., oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, and water. Laser treatment was performed at specific temperature thresholds (from 60 to 110\u25e6C) on in-vivo animal liver and was assessed with a hyperspectral camera (500\u2013995 nm) during and after the treatment.

Results show that properly combining spectral information related to deoxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, lipids, and water allows for the segmenting of different zones of the laser-induced thermal damage.

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study in patients with RA or PsA and healthy controls (HCs). Participants underwent clinical, ultrasonographic and MSOT examination of MCP and wrist joints as well as the entheses of the common extensor tendon at the lateral humeral epicondyles and of the patellar, quadriceps and Achilles tendon. MSOT-measured haemoglobin (Hb), oxygen saturation, collagen and lipid levels were quantified and scaled mean differences between affected and unaffected joints and entheses were calculated as defined by clinical examination or ultrasonography using linear mixed effects models. RESULTS: We obtained 1535 MSOT and 982 ultrasonography scans from 87 participants (34 PsA, 17 RA, 36 HCs). Entheseal tenderness was not associated with significant metabolic changes, whereas enthesitis-related sonographic changes were associated with increased total Hb, oxygen saturation and collagen content. In contrast, the presence of arthritis-related clinical and sonographic findings showed increased Hb levels, reduced oxygen saturation and reduced collagen content. Synovial hypertrophy was associated with increased lipid content in the joints. CONCLUSION: MSOT allows determination of distinct metabolic differences between arthritis and enthesitis in a non-invasive setting in humans in vivo. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

We describe a compact SFDI imager that employs a multispectral compound-eye camera. This design enables simultaneous image acquisition at multiple wavelengths. Such a device has potential for application for quantitative evaluation of superficial tissues by nonspecialists in low-resource settings. Aim: The aim of this work was to develop a compact SFDI imager for widefield imaging of in-vivo tissue optical properties and verify its ability to measure optical properties of tissue-simulating phantoms and in a preclinical model of burn wounds. Approach: This compound-eye imager was constructed using a CMOS sensor subdivided into multiple regions, each having a bandpass filter and objective lens. The ability of the instrument to image optical properties was compared with (1) a commercial SFDI imager and (2) a laboratory-based system. Initial validation of ability to accurately characterize optical properties was performed using a tissue-simulating optical phantom. It was then applied to an established murine model of thermal contact burn severity. In-vivo measurements of the optical properties of rat skin were performed before and after the application of burns. Histology was used to verify burn severity. Results: Measurements of the tissue-simulating phantom optical properties made using the compound-eye imager agree with measurements made using the two comparison SFDI devices. For the murine burn model, the burns showed a decrease in the reduced scattering coefficient at all measurement wavelengths compared with preburn measurements at the same locations. This is consistent with previously reported changes in scattering that occur in full-thickness burns. Conclusion: We demonstrate the potential for SFDI to be translated into compact form factor using a compound-eye camera that is capable of obtaining multiple wavelengths channels simultaneously.  \u00a9 The Authors.

Knowledge of target volume is a fundamental need for radiation therapy (RT). Without such information to guide radiation, normal tissue can be overirradiated, introducing experimental uncertainties. This led us to develop high-contrast quantitative bioluminescence tomography (QBLT) for guidance. The use of a 3-dimensional bioluminescence signal, related to cell viability, for preclinical radiation research is one step toward biology-guided RT. Methods and Materials: Our QBLT system enables multiprojection and multispectral bioluminescence imaging to maximize input data for the tomographic reconstruction. Accurate quantification of spectrum and dynamic change of in vivo signal were also accounted for the QBLT. A spectral-derivative method was implemented to eliminate the modeling of the light propagation from animal surface to detector. We demonstrated the QBLT capability of guiding conformal RT using a bioluminescent glioblastoma (GBM) model in vivo. A threshold was determined to delineate QBLT reconstructed gross target volume (GTVQBLT), which provides the best overlap between the GTVQBLT and CBCT contrast labeled GBM (GTV), used as the ground truth for GBM volume. To account for the uncertainty of GTVQBLT in target positioning and volume delineation, a margin was determined and added to the GTVQBLT to form a QBLT planning target volume (PTVQBLT) for guidance. Results: The QBLT can reconstruct in vivo GBM with localization accuracy within 1 mm. A 0.5-mm margin was determined and added to GTVQBLT to form PTVQBLT, largely improving tumor coverage from 75.0% (0 mm margin) to 97.9% in average, while minimizing normal tissue toxicity. With the goal of prescribed dose 5 Gy covering 95% of PTVQBLT, QBLT-guided 7-field conformal RT can effectively irradiate 99.4 \u00b1 1.0% of GTV.

In this sense, chitosan nanoparticles (CS NPs) encapsulated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and incorporated into retrograded starch and pectin (RS/P) microparticles were developed and their in vivo distribution along the mouse GIT after oral administration was monitored using multispectral optical imaging. In vitro release studies revealed that the encapsulation of CS NPs into RS/P microparticles promoted greater control of 5-FU release rates, with a significant reduction (53%) in acid media that might replicate that found in the stomach following oral administration. The evaluation of the in vivo biodistribution of the CS NPs in mice showed a faster clearance in the distribution pattern along the mouse GIT, i.e., a shorter transit time of CS NPs compared to CS NPs-loaded RS/P microparticles. Additionally, CS NPs alone showed non-specific absorption into the blood-stream with associated kidney accumulation, while for the CS NPs-loaded RS/P microparticles no significant accumulation was observed in blood or major clearance organs. This suggests the specific degradability of RS/P by the colon microbiota appears to have been decisive in the higher protection of the CS NPs along the GIT until release in the colon, preventing unwanted absorption into the bloodstream and major organs following oral administration.

On the other hand, as an emerging detection and imaging modality, optoacoustic tomography (OAT) is capable of providing more detailed information in deep biological tissues than fluorescent imaging, since in OAT ultrasound signals are the reporting signals.

Furthermore, the probe TPA-X-Q displays several advantages, such as quite good selectivity towards NQO1, low cytotoxicity and excellent photostability. Moreover, the probe has been successfully utilized to detect and image the overexpressed NQO1 in the breast cancer-bearing mouse model. Orthogonal-view three-dimensional (3D) images can also be obtained by using multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), and thus precise localization of the breast cancer tumors can be achieved. This probe holds great potential for being employed as an efficacious tool for diagnosing breast cancer via responding to NQO1. \u00a9 2021 Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Intratumoral distribution and ph-dependent drug release of high molecular weight hpma copolymer drug conjugates strongly depend on specific tumor substructure and microenvironment", "abstract": "Stimulus-sensitive polymer drug conjugates based on high molecular weight N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymers carrying doxorubicin via a pH-dependent cleavable bond (pHPMA-Dox) were previously shown to be able to overcome multi-drug resistance. Nevertheless, a tumor type dependent differential response was observed. Although an improved and more selective tumor accumulation of pHPMA-Dox is generally achieved due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, little is known about the fate of these conjugates upon entering the tumor tissue, which could explain the different responses. In this study, we compared in vitro and in vivo accumulation and Dox-activation of pHPMA-Dox in three cancer cell line models (1411HP, A2780cis, HT29) and derived xenografttumors using a near-infrared fluorescence-labeledpHPMA-Dox conjugate. Firstly, cytotoxicity assays using different pH conditions proved a stepwise, pH-dependent increase in cytotoxic activity and revealed comparable sensitivity among the cell lines. Using multispectral fluorescence microscopy, we were able to track the distribution of drug and polymeric carrier simultaneously on cellular and histological levels. Microscopic analyses of cell monolayers confirmed the assumed mechanism of cell internalization of the whole conjugate followed by intracellular cleavage and nuclear accumulation of Dox in all three cell lines. In contrast, intratumoral distribution and drug release in xenografttumors were completely different and were associated with different tissue substructures and microenvironments analyzed by Azan-and Hypoxisense\u00ae-staining. In 1411HP tumors, large vessels and less hypoxic/acidic microenvironments were associated with a pattern resulting from consistent tissue distribution and cellular uptake as whole conjugate followed by intracellular drug release. In A2780cis tumors, an inconsistent pattern of distribution partly resulting from premature drug release was associated with a more hypoxic/acidic microenvironment, compacted tumor tissue with compressed vessels and specific pre-damaged tissue structures. A completely different distribution pattern was observed in HT29 tumors, resulting from high accumulation of polymer in abundant fibrotic structures, with small embedded vessels featuring this tumor type together with pronounced premature drug release due to the strongly hypoxic/acidic microenvironment. In conclusion, the pattern of intratumoral distribution and drug release strongly depends on the tumor substructure and microenvironment and may result in different degrees of therapeutic efficacy. This reflects the pronounced heterogeneity observed in the clinical application of nanomedicines and can be exploited for the future design of such conjugates. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Novel endoscopic optical diagnostic technologies in medical trial research: recent advancements and future prospects", "abstract": "Novel endoscopic biophotonic diagnostic technologies have the potential to non-invasively detect the interior of a hollow organ or cavity of the human body with subcellular resolution or to obtain biochemical information about tissue in real time. With the capability to visualize or analyze the diagnostic target in vivo, these techniques gradually developed as potential candidates to challenge histopathology which remains the gold standard for diagnosis. Consequently, many innovative endoscopic diagnostic techniques have succeeded in detection, characterization, and confirmation: the three critical steps for routine endoscopic diagnosis. In this review, we mainly summarize researches on emerging endoscopic optical diagnostic techniques, with emphasis on recent advances. We also introduce the fundamental principles and the development of those techniques and compare their characteristics. Especially, we shed light on the merit of novel endoscopic imaging technologies in medical research. For example, hyperspectral imaging and Raman spectroscopy provide direct molecular information, while optical coherence tomography and multi-photo endomicroscopy offer a more extensive detection range and excellent spatial\u2013temporal resolution. Furthermore, we summarize the unexplored application fields of these endoscopic optical techniques in major hospital departments for biomedical researchers. Finally, we provide a brief overview of the future perspectives, as well as bottlenecks of those endoscopic optical diagnostic technologies.

Images were collected during CRS in 11 patients in the wavelength range of 665\u2013975 nm, and processed by calibration, normalization, and noise filtering. A linear support vector machine (SVM) was employed to classify healthy and tumorous tissue (defined as >50% tumor cells). Classifier performance was evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Images of 26 tissue samples from 10 patients were included, containing 26,446 data points that were matched to histopathology. Tumorous tissue could be classified with an area under the curve of 0.83, a sensitivity of 0.81, a specificity of 0.70, and Matthew\u2019s correlation coefficient of 0.41. This study paves the way to in vivo and intraoperative use of HSI during CRS. Hyperspectral imaging can scan a whole tissue surface in a fast and non-contact way.

As in the previous year, muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) was the main topic of the congress based upon the rapid evolution in this field over the last several years. This year\u00b4s meeting was dominated by presentations focusing on genomic subtyping in MIBC and identification of novel therapeutic targets. These topics were complemented by submissions on immunotherapy, a variety of clinical topics, and biomarker research. Based upon the presentations, it may be concluded that the IBCN increasingly serves as an interdisciplinary forum not only for the presentation of work-in-progress covering all facets of bladder cancer research, but also for catalyzing the discussion of discrepant research findings in an effort to find consensus. The 16th Meeting of the IBCN took place from October 11 to 13th, 2018 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, hosted by Ellen Zwarthoff and Joost Boormans. Approximately 120 participants gathered for another fully packed program displaying recent achievements in basic and clinical research covering the entire spectrum of bladder cancer. This year's meeting was dominated by presentations focusing on genomic subtyping and identification of novel therapeutic targets. These topics were complemented by submissions on immunotherapy, clinical topics, and biomarker research. Keynote lectures were delivered by G. Robertson (Canada) on MIBC genomics and the organizational challenges of the PanCancerAtlas project. Comprehensive information was provided on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project including the structure of the consortium and the development and validation of molecular classification of MIBC. Results from the project suggest that regulons (groups of genes controlled by a common regulator) appear to be correlated with prognosis and may replace gene expression analysis in the future. M. Thelen (Switzerland) discussed the role of chemokines in cancer metastasization reporting on his research on the atypical chemokine receptor 3. The inaugural IBCN lecture was presented by M. Ingersoll (France) discussing gender disparities in development of adaptive immunity following Bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy. In addition to the traditional \u201cIndustry meets IBCN\u201d sessions, a format for discussion between industry representatives, researchers, and physicians in break-out groups, new formats were introduced\u2014in the Oxford style of debate, P.J. Goebell (Germany) and W. Stadler (USA) delivered animated discussion on the appropriateness of urologists administering systemic immune checkpoint inhibitors. There was consensus that practice may differ between different health systems and countries, and educational/training background. In a second interesting discussion, D. McConkey (USA) and H. Al-Ahmadie (USA) debated if traditional histology will be replaced by molecular classification of bladder tumors. It was concluded that molecular classification offers valuable additional information but cannot yet replace traditional histology. Furthermore, the growing evidence of tumor heterogeneity in bladder cancer was discussed in a separate topic session. L. Dyrskjot discussed genomic and transcriptomic heterogeneity and their impact on clinical decision making. G. Sj\u00f6dahl presented data on heterogeneity of molecular subtypes within the primary tumor and between the primary tumor and metastases, that is surprisingly limited. Y. Allory discussed spatial and temporal heterogeneity of bladder cancers particularly focusing on the basal-like phenotype. Due to the continued increase in the number of participants and abstract submissions, a poster session was implemented at this year\u00b4s meeting for the first time. Posters were briefly presented in the forum. Two travel awards were presented to H. Yamashita (USA) for his submission on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-mediated repression of transcription factor activating protein 2 alfa expression identifying a transcriptional circuit in basal-squamous bladder cancer in a cell line model. S.B. Williams (USA) received his award for his registry-based analysis of outcome and costs in patients with localized MIBC undergoing either bladder sparing trimodal therapy or radical cystectomy. The latter was found to generate improved survival outcomes at lower costs as compared with trimodal therapy. The best presentation awards were presented to A. Kamoun (France) who discussed a consensus molecular classification for MIBC. The international demand for a consensus classification, already raised at previous meetings, has resonated with important players in this field. A potential consensus comprising 6 classes was proposed based upon a thorough analysis of the existing classifications. As an extension of the IBCN meeting a consensus conference on genomic classification of MIBC was held that included all major groups in this field. M. Garige (USA) received his award for a detailed examination of inhibitors of metabolic processes in bladder cancer cells before and after therapy. A take home message of the meeting was that the IBCN increasingly serves as an interdisciplinary forum not for the presentation of work-in-progress covering all facets of bladder cancer research, but also for catalyzing the discussion of discrepant research findings in an effort to find consensus. Exemplified may this also be by the fact that the efforts to unify the subclassification of MIBC had its nidus on the preceding meetings of the IBCN on this topic and brought together the various disciplines which ultimately were able to finalize their consensus work in a last concluding meeting directly following the IBCN. Thus, the IBCN meetings and the close cooperation of IBCN with its official journal, Urological Oncology, continue to provide a unique platform for exchange, discussing and intensifying multidimensional collaborations, thus finally satisfying the increasing need for answers regarding the management of bladder cancer patients. The 17th meeting of the IBCN will take place in Aarhus, Denmark, October 3 to 5, 2019. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Non-invasive imaging of tau-targeted probe uptake by whole brain multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography", "abstract": "Purpose: Abnormal tau accumulation within the brain plays an important role in tauopathies such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and frontotemporal dementia. High-resolution imaging of tau deposits at the whole-brain scale in animal disease models is highly desired. Methods: We approached this challenge by non-invasively imaging the brains of P301L mice of 4-repeat tau with concurrent volumetric multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (vMSOT) at ~ 115\u00a0\u03bcm spatial resolution using the tau-targeted pyridinyl-butadienyl-benzothiazole derivative PBB5 (i.v.). In vitro probe characterization, concurrent vMSOT and epi-fluorescence imaging of in vivo PBB5 targeting (i.v.) was performed in P301L and wild-type mice, followed by ex vivo validation using AT-8 antibody for phosphorylated tau. Results: PBB5 showed specific binding to recombinant K18 tau fibrils by fluorescence assay, to post-mortem Alzheimer\u2019s disease brain tissue homogenate by competitive binding against [11C]PBB3 and to tau deposits (AT-8 positive) in post-mortem corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy brains. Dose-dependent optoacoustic and fluorescence signal intensities were observed in the mouse brains following i.v. administration of different concentrations of PBB5. In vivo vMSOT brain imaging of P301L mice showed higher retention of PBB5 in the tau-laden cortex and hippocampus compared to wild-type mice, as confirmed by ex vivo vMSOT, epi-fluorescence, multiphoton microscopy, and immunofluorescence staining. Conclusions: We demonstrated non-invasive whole-brain imaging of tau in P301L mice with vMSOT system using PBB5 at a previously unachieved ~ 115\u00a0\u03bcm spatial resolution.

The goals of this study were to evaluate the effect of pre-weaned rat gastric fluids on 50 nm CuO NPs and TiO2 E171 in vitro, and to evaluate uptake in vivo. The NP uptake was studied in vivo in male and female Sprague-Dawley rat pups following oral administration of four consecutive daily doses of 10 mg/kg CuO NPs, TiO2 E171, or vehicle control (water) between postnatal day (PND) 7\u201310. Rat pups were sacrificed on either PND10 or PND21. Simulated digestion led to dissolution of CuO NPs at the later ages tested (PND14 and PND21, but not PND7). In vivo intestinal uptake of CuO NPs and TiO2 E171 was observed by hyperspectral imaging of intestinal cross sections. Brightfield microscopy showed that the number of immune cells increased in the intestinal tissue following NP administration. Orally administered NPs led to low intestinal uptake of NPs and an increase in immune cells in the small and large intestine, suggesting that oral exposure to NPs during early life may lead to irritation or a low-grade inflammation. The long-term impact of increased immune cells in the intestinal tract during early life is unknown. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

For patients with such tumors, T cell-based immunotherapy alone infrequently results in durable tumor control. Methods Here, we developed experimental models to study mechanisms of T-cell escape and demonstrated that resistance to T-cell killing can be overcome by the addition of natural killer (NK) cells engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). Results In engineered models of tumor heterogeneity, PD-L1 CAR-engineered NK cells (PD-L1 t-haNKs) prevented the clonal selection of T cell-resistant tumor cells observed with T-cell treatment alone in multiple models. Treatment of heterogenous cancer cell populations with T cells resulted in interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b33) release and subsequent upregulation of PD-L1 on tumor cells that escaped T-cell killing through defects in antigen processing and presentation, priming escape cell populations for PD-L1 dependent killing by PD-L1 t-haNKs in vitro and in vivo.

While gross total resection improves the prognosis, a supratotal resection may result in neurological deficits. On the other hand, accurate intraoperative identification of the tumor boundaries may be very difficult, resulting in subtotal resections. Histological examination of biopsies can be used repeatedly to help achieve gross total resection but this is not practically feasible due to the turn-around time of the tissue analysis. Therefore, intraoperative techniques to recognize tissue types are investigated to expedite the clinical workflow for tumor resection and improve outcome by aiding in the identification and removal of the malignant lesion. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an optical imaging technique with the power of extracting additional information from the imaged tissue. Because HSI images cannot be visually assessed by human observers, we instead exploit artificial intelligence techniques and leverage a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to investigate the potential of HSI in twelve in vivo specimens. The proposed framework consists of a 3D\u20132D hybrid CNN-based approach to create a joint extraction of spectral and spatial information from hyperspectral images. A comparison study was conducted exploiting a 2D CNN, a 1D DNN and two conventional classification methods (SVM, and the SVM classifier combined with the 3D\u20132D hybrid CNN) to validate the proposed network. An overall accuracy of 80% was found when tumor, healthy tissue and blood vessels were classified, clearly outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. These results can serve as a basis for brain tumor classification using HSI, and may open future avenues for image-guided neurosurgical applications. \u00a9 2020 by the authors.

However, the underlying mechanisms of RLIPoC mediating cross-organ protection remain to be fully elucidated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ischemic stroke was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 60 minutes. RLIPoC was performed with 3 cycles of 10-minute ischemia followed by 10-minute reperfusion of the bilateral femoral arteries im-mediately af ter middle cerebral artery reperfusion. The percentage of regulatory T cells ( Tregs) in the spleen, blood, and brain was detected using flow cytometry, and the number of Tregs in the ischemic hemisphere was counted using transgenic mice with an enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged Foxp3. Furthermore, the metabolic status was monitored dynamically using a multispectral optical imaging system. The Tregs were conditionally depleted in the depletion of Treg transgenic mice af ter the injection of the diphtheria toxin. The inflammatory response and neuronal apoptosis were investigated using immunofluorescent staining. Infarct volume and neurological deficits were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging and the modified neurological severity score, respectively. The results showed that RLIPoC substan-tially reduced infarct volume, improved neurological function, and significantly increased Tregs in the spleen, blood, and ischemic hemisphere af ter middle cerebral artery occlusion. RLIPoC was followed by subsequent alteration in metabo-lites, such as flavin adenine dinucleotide and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrate, both in RLIPoC-conducted local tissues and circulating blood. Furthermore, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrate can mimic RLIPoC in increasing Tregs. Conversely, the depletion of Tregs using depletion of Treg mice compromised the neuroprotective ef fects con-ferred by RLIPoC. CONCLUSIONS: RLIPoC protects against ischemic brain injury, at least in part by activating and maintaining the Tregs through the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrate pathway. \u00a9 2021 The Authors.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "High compression deep learning based single-pixel hyperspectral macroscopic fluorescence lifetime imaging in vivo", "abstract": "Single pixel imaging frameworks facilitate the acquisition of high-dimensional optical data in biological applications with photon starved conditions.

The current procedure for melanoma diagnosis is based on dermoscopy, i.e., a qualitative visual inspection of lesions with intrinsic limited diagnostic reliability and reproducibility. Other non-invasive diagnostic techniques may represent valuable solutions to retrieve additional objective information of a lesion. This review aims to compare the diagnostic performance of non-invasive techniques, alternative to dermoscopy, for melanoma detection in clinical settings. A systematic review of the available literature was performed using PubMed, Scopus and Google scholar databases (2010-September 2020). All human, in-vivo, non-invasive studies using techniques, alternative to dermoscopy, for melanoma diagnosis were included with no restriction on the recruited population. The reference standard was histology but dermoscopy was accepted only in case of benign lesions. Attributes of the analyzed studies were compared, and the quality was evaluated using CASP Checklist. For studies in which the investigated technique was implemented as a diagnostic tool (DTA studies), the QUADAS-2 tool was applied. For DTA studies that implemented a melanoma vs. other skin lesions classification task, a meta-analysis was performed reporting the SROC curves. Sixty-two references were included in the review, of which thirty-eight were analyzed using QUADAS-2. Study designs were: clinical trials (13), retrospective studies (10), prospective studies (8), pilot studies (10), multitiered study (1); the remain studies were proof of concept or had undefined study type. Studies were divided in categories based on the physical principle employed by each diagnostic technique. Twenty-nine out of thirty-eight DTA studies were included in the meta-analysis. Heterogeneity of studies' types, testing strategy, and diagnostic task limited the systematic comparison of the techniques. Based on the SROC curves, spectroscopy achieved the best performance in terms of sensitivity (93%, 95% CI 92.8\u201393.2%) and specificity (85.2%, 95%CI 84.9\u201385.5%), even though there was high concern regarding robustness of metrics.

Current endoscopic methods are not able to efficiently detect and characterize gastric inflammation, leading to a sub-optimal patients\u2019 care. New non-invasive methods are needed. Reflectance mucosal light analysis is of particular interest in this context. The aim of our study was to analyze reflectance light and specific autofluorescence signals, both in humans and in a mouse model of gastritis. Methods: We recruited patients undergoing gastroendoscopic procedure during which reflectance was analysed with a multispectral camera. In parallel, the gastritis mouse model of Helicobacter pylori infection was used to investigate reflectance from ex vivo gastric samples using a spectrometer. In both cases, autofluorescence signals were measured using a confocal microscope. Findings: In gastritis patients, reflectance modifications were significant in near-infrared spectrum, with a decrease between 610 and 725 nm and an increase between 750 and 840 nm. Autofluorescence was also modified, showing variations around 550 nm of emission. In H. pylori infected mice developing gastric inflammatory lesions, we observed significant reflectance modifications 18 months after infection, with increased intensity between 617 and 672 nm. Autofluorescence was significantly modified after 1, 3 and 6 months around 550 and 630 nm. Both in human and in mouse, these reflectance data can be considered as biomarkers and accurately predicted inflammatory state.

HyU is efficient and robust, capable of quantitative signal separation even at low illumination levels. In dynamic imaging of developing zebrafish embryos and in mouse tissue, HyU was able to cleanly and efficiently unmix multiple fluorescent labels, even in demanding volumetric timelapse imaging settings.

The aim of this ex vivo study was to test the feasibility of bladder tumor biopsies using the rMSI system and compare it to a conventional endoscopic system. Methods: A 3D printed rigid bladder phantom was equipped with small and flat (5 mm \u00d7 1 mm) mock-bladder-tumors made of silicone and fluorescent Qdots655 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany). Urologists (n=15) were asked to perform a rigid cystoscopy and biopsy of all identified lesions (n=6) using a prototype rMSI system and the Image1 S system (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen). Success rate and completion time were measured. The image quality of both systems and the usability of the rMSI system according to the system usability scale (SUS) were evaluated with a task-specific questionnaire. Results: Tumor detection and biopsy rate were 100% (90/90) for the rMSI system and 98.9% (89/90) for the Image1 S system (P=0.3). The biopsy completion time did not differ significantly between the systems (P=0.48). Differentiation between healthy and suspect mucosa with the rMSI system was rated as comparable to the Image1 S system by 53% of surgeons and as better by 33% of the surgeons. The median SUS score for the rMSI system was 87.5%. Conclusions: Accurate transurethral biopsies are feasible with the rMSI system. Furthermore, the rMSI system has an excellent SUS.

Platelets play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and proliferative vascular changes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether human platelets are able to induce transplant arteriosclerosis in a humanized C57/Bl6-Rag2-/-\u03b3c-/-mouse xenograft model. Methods. Nonactivated and in vitro-activated human platelets were analyzed and phenotyped for surface markers by flow cytometry. Side branches of human mammary arteries were implanted into the infrarenal aorta of recipients, followed by daily application of human platelets and histological analyzed on day 30 after transplantation. Results. Human platelets collected by apheresis had low levels of platelet activation markers. However, after in vitro activation, expression was markedly increased. Sixty minutes after injection in recipient mice, nonactivated human platelets become significantly activated. Increased adhesion of platelets to the vascular endothelium was detected by in vivo fluorescence microscopy. After intravenous injection of nonactivated or activated platelets, human xenografts showed pronounced intimal proliferation. Immunohistological analysis showed that the group treated with activated human platelets exhibited significantly increased intragraft protein expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta and smooth muscle cell migration into the neointima. Conclusions. These data demonstrate that an isolated daily application of both in vivo- and in vitro-activated human platelets results in the development of transplant arteriosclerosis in a humanized mouse transplantation model. \u00a9 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

We aim to compare it to an established HSI-system for open surgery (HSI-Open). Methods: Intraoperative HSI was done using the HSI-MIS and HSI-Open at the Region of Interest (ROI). 19 patients undergoing gastrointestinal resections were analyzed in this study. The HSI-MIS-acquired images were aligned with those from the HSI-Open, and spectra and parameter images were compared pixel-wise. We calculated the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for Tissue Oxygen Saturation (StO2), Near-Infrared Perfusion Index (NIR-PI), Tissue Water Index (TWI), and Organ Hemoglobin Index (OHI), as well as the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) over the whole spectrum. Our analysis of parameters was optimized using partial least squares (PLS) regression. Two experienced surgeons carried out an additional color-change analysis, comparing the ROI images and deciding whether they provided the same (acceptable) or different visual information (rejected). Results: HSI and subsequent image registration was possible in 19 patients.

Ung\u2212/\u2212 mice develop B-cell lymphoma (BCL). However, since UNG has anti- and pro-oncogenic activities, its tumor suppressor relevance is unclear. Moreover, how the constant DNA damage and repair caused by the AID and UNG interplay affects B-cell fitness and thereby the dynamics of cell populations in vivo is unknown. Here, we show that UNG specifically protects the fitness of germinal center B cells, which express AID, and not of any other B-cell subset, coincident with AID-induced telomere damage activating p53-dependent checkpoints. Consistent with AID expression being detrimental in UNG-deficient B cells, Ung\u2212/\u2212 mice develop BCL originating from activated B cells but lose AID expression in the established tumor. Accordingly, we find that UNG is rarely lost in human BCL. The fitness preservation activity of UNG contingent to AID expression was confirmed in a B-cell leukemia model. Hence, UNG, typically considered a tumor suppressor, acquires tumor-enabling activity in cancer cell populations that express AID by protecting cell fitness. \u00a9C The Author(s) 2020", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Shortwave infrared emitting multicolored nanoprobes for biomarker-specific cancer imaging in vivo", "abstract": "Background: The ability to detect tumor-specific biomarkers in real-time using optical imaging plays a critical role in preclinical studies aimed at evaluating drug safety and treatment response. In this study, we engineered an imaging platform capable of targeting different tumor biomarkers using a multi-colored library of nanoprobes. These probes contain rare-earth elements that emit light in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelength region (900\u20131700 nm), which exhibits reduced absorption and scattering compared to visible and NIR, and are rendered biocompatible by encapsulation in human serum albumin. The spectrally distinct emissions of the holmium (Ho), erbium (Er), and thulium (Tm) cations that constitute the cores of these nanoprobes make them attractive candidates for optical molecular imaging of multiple disease biomarkers. Methods: SWIR-emitting rare-earth-doped albumin nanocomposites (ReANCs) were synthesized using controlled coacervation, with visible light-emitting fluorophores additionally incorporated during the crosslinking phase for validation purposes. Specifically, HoANCs, ErANCs, and TmANCs were co-labeled with rhodamine-B, FITC, and Alexa Fluor 647 dyes respectively. These Rh-HoANCs, FITC-ErANCs, and 647-TmANCs were further conjugated with the targeting ligands daidzein, AMD3100, and folic acid respectively. Binding specificities of each nanoprobe to distinct cellular subsets were established by in vitro uptake studies. Quantitative whole-body SWIR imaging of subcutaneous tumor bearing mice was used to validate the in vivo targeting ability of these nanoprobes. Results: Each of the three ligand-functionalized nanoprobes showed significantly higher uptake in the targeted cell line compared to untargeted probes. Increased accumulation of tumor-specific nanoprobes was also measured relative to untargeted probes in subcutaneous tumor models of breast (4175 and MCF-7) and ovarian cancer (SKOV3). Preferential accumulation of tumor-specific nanoprobes was also observed in tumors overexpressing targeted biomarkers in mice bearing molecularly-distinct bilateral subcutaneous tumors, as evidenced by significantly higher signal intensities on SWIR imaging. Conclusions: The results from this study show that tumors can be detected in vivo using a set of targeted multispectral SWIR-emitting nanoprobes. Significantly, these nanoprobes enabled imaging of biomarkers in mice bearing bilateral tumors with distinct molecular phenotypes. The findings from this study provide a foundation for optical molecular imaging of heterogeneous tumors and for studying the response of these complex lesions to targeted therapy. \u00a9 2020, The Author(s).", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Signal to noise ratio quantifies the contribution of spectral channels to classification of human head and neck tissues ex vivo using deep learning and multispectral imaging", "abstract": "Significance: Accurate identification of tissues is critical for performing safe surgery.

In this study, we examined the pharmacological blockade of lipid oxidation with ranolazine in TRAMPC1 PCa models. Oral administration of ranolazine (100 mg/Kg for 21 days) resulted in decreased tumor CD8+ T-cells Tim3 content, increased macrophages, and decreased blood myeloid immunosuppressive monocytes. Using multispectral staining, drug treatments increased infiltration of CD8+ T-cells and dendritic cells compared to vehicle. Functional studies with spleen cells of drug-treated tumors co-cultured with TRAMPC1 cells showed increased ex vivo T-cell cytotoxic activity, suggesting an anti-tumoral response. Lastly, a decrease in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells expressing PD1 was observed when exhausted spleen cells were incubated with TRAMPC1 Cpt1a-KD compared to the control cells. These data indicated that genetically blocking the ability of the tumor cells to oxidize lipid can change the activation status of the neighboring T-cells.

Even though a range of works have been presented, only a few showed slightly promising results for human tissue, and these were mostly focused on pathological and non-pathological tissue classification. Methods: In this work, several spectral similarity measures on hyperspectral (HS) images of in vivo human tissue were evaluated for tissue discrimination purposes. Moreover, we introduced two new hybrid spectral measures, called SID-JM-TAN(SAM) and SID-JM-TAN(SCA).

This is especially the case in the surgical treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), an optical technology based on light tissue interactions, can potentially characterize tissue during surgery thereby guiding the surgeon intraoperatively. DRS has shown to be able to discriminate pure healthy breast tissue from pure invasive carcinoma (IC) but limited research has been done on (1) the actual optical characteristics of DCIS and (2) the ability of DRS to characterize measurements that are a mixture of tissue types. Methods: In this study, DRS spectra were acquired from 107 breast specimens from 107 patients with proven IC and/or DCIS (1488 measurement locations). With a generalized estimating equation model, the differences between the DRS spectra of locations with DCIS and IC and only healthy tissue were compared to see if there were significant differences between these spectra. Subsequently, different classification models were developed to be able to predict if the DRS spectrum of a measurement location represented a measurement location with \u201chealthy\u201d or \u201cmalignant\u201d tissue. In the development and testing of the models, different definitions for \u201chealthy\u201d and \u201cmalignant\u201d were used. This allowed varying the level of homogeneity in the train and test data. Results: It was found that the optical characteristics of IC and DCIS were similar. Regarding the classification of tissue with a mixture of tissue types, it was found that using mixed measurement locations in the development of the classification models did not tremendously improve the accuracy of the classification of other measurement locations with a mixture of tissue types. The evaluated classification models were able to classify measurement locations with > 5% malignant cells with a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.41 or 0.40. Some models showed better sensitivity whereas others had better specificity. Conclusion: The results suggest that DRS has the potential to detect malignant tissue, including DCIS, in healthy breast tissue and could thus be helpful for surgical guidance. \u00a9 2021, The Author(s).", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "CreLite: An optogenetically controlled Cre/loxP system using red light", "abstract": "Background: Precise manipulation of gene expression with temporal and spatial control is essential for functional analysis and determining cell lineage relationships in complex biological systems.

However, specificity is dependent on the availability of tissue- or cell-specific regulatory elements used in combination with Cre.

Results: Cre activity is disabled by splitting Cre and fusing with the Arabidopsis thaliana red light-inducible binding partners, PhyB and PIF6.

PDT uses photosensitizer (PS), the light of a specific wavelength, and molecular oxygen to produce highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), which causes cell death via different mechanisms such as vessel constriction, immunological response, and cell damage by apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis pathways. Fundamental studies of PDT suggest that ROS yield can be affected by various factors such as transportation efficiency and tumor-targeting ability of PSs, illumination strategy of excitation sources, oxygen supply or dependence of the ROS-generation process, and combination with other therapeutic methods, hence directly determining the therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, the relationship between treatment dose and PDT efficacy is still under investigation. The evaluation for PDT indirectly but considerably affects the PDT efficacy by accurately monitoring dosimetric parameters of PDT, which is followed by efficiently regulating and upgrading the therapeutic scheme. In this study, the recent advances in PSs, light sources, tissue oxygenation, synergistic treatment, and dosimetry for improving the clinical PDT efficacy are summarized. Progress Several novel PSs such as C60, black phosphorus, graphene quantum dots, and PSs with aggregation-induced emission, have been developed to improve the quantum yield of 102 \u2022 The delivery efficiency of PSs has been improved by different PS delivery strategies and the tumor-microenvironment-responsive release scheme. PS absorption has been enhanced by organelle targeting and photochemical internalization, and PS hypoxia resistance has been resolved through loading with oxygen carriers or oxygen-generating reactants. Further, PS development with the synergistic therapeutic function will be used to enhance PDT efficacy. As for PDT excitation sources, solar light, broad-spectrum lamps, lasers, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), X-ray sources, ultrasonic sources, and in vivo self-excited light sources capable of bioluminescence, chemiluminescence and Cherenkov light, have been widely studied. LEDs and lasers are the most popular light sources in clinical practice. Particularly, wearable, implantable, and disposable PDT light sources have progressed significantly because of the development of inorganic LED arrays, flexible LEDs, and wireless-driven LEDs. Further, in vivo self-excited light source has been studied to eliminate the absorption and scattering of light by biological tissues. Additionally, new illumination schemes of light fractionation and metronomic PDTs have been proposed to ensure oxygen supply during PDT treatment. Oxygen carriers with high oxygen storage capacity or the chemical reaction substance can be delivered to the target lesion for in situ oxygen generation, which is the most popular method of enhancing oxygen supply for PDT. Additionally, hypoxia-activated linkers or prodrugs have been used to compensate for the low efficacy caused by hypoxia. However, reducing oxygen consumption during PDT can be achieved by limiting certain oxygen-consuming intracellular chemical reactions or reducing oxygen dependence using types I or IE PDT. To improve the therapeutic efficacy, PDT has been combined with clinical surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, photothermal therapy, sonodynamic therapy, magnetic hyperthermia, and immunotherapy. Three or more modes for synergistic treatment with PDT have been presented. Further, simultaneously employing two PSs targeting different subcellular organelle is also employed to improve PDT efficacy. Advanced optical imaging techniques such as hyperspectral imaging, Doppler optical coherence tomography, photoacoustic imaging measurement, and 102 luminescence imaging have been used successfully to monitor the dosimetric parameters from the original single-point/point-by-point signal acquisition to 2D imaging. The development of the detector has significantly improved the sensitivity, resolution, field of view, and speed of the optical imaging system. For example, the spatiotemporal detection of 102 luminescence can be accomplished by combining time-resolved scanning imaging and steady-state wide-field imaging. Clinical applications of PDT are primarily used for tumor-, vascular-, and microbial-targeting treatments. Vascular-targeting PDT has been successfully demonstrated for treating vascular-related diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and port-wine stain. Additionally, PDT is effective against bacteria, viruses, and fungi in clinical applications. Conclusions and Prospects Despite its clinical effectiveness, PDT is currently underutilized because of the non-fully satisfied and expensive PS, unclear dose-efficiency relationship, and difficulties in translating proof-of-principle research. To further improve PDT efficacy, ongoing research is being pursued to develop the multifunctional nano-PS, wearable LED and self-excited light sources, and the spatiotemporal multimodal optical imaging platform for monitoring and optimizing dosimetric parameters for pre-, during-, and post-PDT. \u00a9 2022 Science Press.

A Multispectral SnapShot Camera (MSSC) is demonstrated to address these obstacles, which is capable of capturing data simultaneously in multiple wavelengths with a single click.

PCA was used to compress the multispectral datacube to extract wavelengths with maximum variance and SAM discriminates between tissue conditions based on distinct spectral profiles.

COPD progresses with aging, and chronic smoking is the key susceptibility factor in lung pathological changes concurrent with mitochondrial dysfunction and biological aging. However, these processes involving cigarette smoke (CS)-mediated lung cellular senescence are difficult to distinguish. One of the impediments to studying cellular senescence in relation to age-related lung pathologies is the lack of a suitable in vivo model. In view of this, we provide evidence that supports the suitability of p16-3MR mice to studying cellular senescence in CS-mediated and age-related lung pathologies. p16-3MR mice have a trimodal reporter fused to the promoter of the p16INK4a gene that enables detection, isolation, and selective elimination of senescent cells, thus making them a suitable model to study cellular senescence. To determine their suitability in CS-mediated lung pathologies, we exposed young (12\u201314 months) and old (17\u201320 months) p16-3MR mice to 30 day CS exposure and studied the expression of senescent genes (p16, p21, and p53) and SASP-associated markers (MMP9, MMP12, PAI-1, and FN-1) in air-and CS-exposed mouse lungs. Our results showed that this model could detect cellular senescence using luminescence and isolate cells undergoing senescence with the help of tissue fluorescence in CS-exposed young and old mice. Our results from the expression of senescence markers and SASP-associated genes in CS-exposed young and old p16-3MR mice were comparable with increased lung cellular senescence and SASP in COPD. We further showed alteration in the; (i) tissue luminescence and fluorescence, (ii) mRNA and protein expressions of senescent markers and SASP genes, and (iii) SA-\u03b2-gal activity in CS-exposed young and old p16-3MR mice as compared to their air controls. Overall, we showed that p16-3MR is a competent model for studying the cellular senescence in CS-induced pathologies. Hence, the p16-3MR reporter mouse model may be used as a novel tool for understanding the pathobiology of cellular senescence and other underlying mechanisms involved in COPD and fibrosis. \u00a9 2021 by the authors.

Background: Despite advances in cardiovascular diagnostics, the analytic tools and imaging technologies currently available have limited capabilities for evaluating in situ biochemical changes associated with luminal surface features. Earlier studies of small number of samples have shown differences among the autofluorescence lifetime signature of well-defined lesions, but a systematic pixel-level evaluation of fluorescence signatures associated with various histological features is lacking and needed to better understand the origins of fluorescence contrast. Methods: Human coronary artery segments (n = 32) were analyzed with a bimodal catheter system combining multispectral FLIm with intravascular ultrasonography compatible with in vivo coronary imaging. Various histological components present along the luminal surface (200-\u03bcm depth) were systematically tabulated (12 sectors) from each serial histological section (n = 204). Morphological information provided by ultrasonography allowed for the accurate registration of imaging data with histology data. The relationships between histological findings and FLIm parameters obtained from 3 spectral channels at each measurement location (n = 33,980) were characterized. Results: Our findings indicate that fluorescence lifetime from different spectral bands can be used to quantitatively predict the superficial presence of macrophage foam cells (mFCs) (area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve: 0.94) and extracellular lipid content in advanced lesions (lifetime increase in 540-nm band), detect superficial calcium (lifetime decrease in 450-nm band area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve: 0.90), and possibly detect lesions consistent with active plaque formation such as pathological intimal thickening and healed thrombus regions (lifetime increase in 390-nm band).

MSOT imaging was applied on mice bearing orthotopic 4T1 breast tumors before and following treatment with doxorubicin. Apoptosis was monitored over time by imaging the distribution of xPLORE-APOFL750\u00a9, a highly sensitive poly-caspase binding apoptotic probe, within the tumors. Oxygenation was monitored by tracking the distribution of oxy-and deoxygenated hemoglobin within the same tumor areas.

In the first version of AcousticX, acoustic detection was performed using linear array ultrasound probes with center frequencies of 5, 7 and 10 MHz.

However, it is important to improve the imaging depth for exploring wide range of deep-tissue applications. In this work, we developed a new broadband 2.5 MHz ultrasound probe to improve the imaging depth. Using this ultrasound probe and 850 nm LED arrays, we performed phantom, ex vivo and in vivo human volunteer studies and achieved an imaging depth of 2.5-3 cm. We compared the imaging performance of the newly developed probe with the already available US probes and conformed that the 2.5 MHz probe is 3-4 times more sensitive with spatial resolution suitable for deep-tissue applications.

Yet today there are no percutaneous devices that can detect autofluorescence signals from inside a beating heart. Our aim was to develop a prototype catheter to demonstrate the feasibility of doing so. Methods and Results: Here we summarize technical solutions leading to the development of a percutaneous catheter capable of multispectral imaging of intracardiac surfaces. The process included several iterations of light sources, optical filtering, and image acquisition techniques. The developed system included a compliant balloon, 355 nm laser irradiance, a high-sensitivity CCD, bandpass filtering, and image acquisition synchronized with the cardiac cycle. It enabled us to capture autofluorescence images from multiple spectral bands within the visible range while illuminating the endocardial surface with ultraviolet light. Principal component analysis and other spectral unmixing post-processing algorithms were then used to reveal target tissue. Conclusion: Based on the success of our prototype system, we are confident that the development of ever more sensitive cameras, recent advances in tunable filters, fiber bundles, and other optical and computational components makes it possible to create percutaneous catheters capable of acquiring hyper or multispectral hypercubes, including those based on autofluorescence, in real-time.

However, due to the changes of spectral signatures of some exogenous contrast agents in vitro and in vivo, the conventional fitting method will be hindered. Although the blind unmixing algorithms do not require the exact absorption spectrum of each chromophore in advance, it is often sensitive to noise, which may lead to low quantitative results. Considering that the non-negativity of concentration distribution and absorption spectra of the chromophores as well as the sparsity of concentration image of exogenous contrast agent in the gradient domain, we herein propose a modified MSPAT implementation that utilizes a non-negative matrix factorization iterative reconstruction framework with the support of a priori information of spectral signature of oxy-/deoxy-hemoglobin and valid sparsity regularization during the iteration. Consequently, the spectral signature of the exogenous contrast agent and the concentration distribution of each chromophore can be recovered simultaneously. The proposed approach has been validated by simulation and in vivo experiments, exhibiting promising performances in image fidelity even when the multi-wavelength photoacoustic tomographic images used for spectral unmixing are affected by noise or reconstruction artifacts. \u00a9 COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Therefore, the near-infrared spectrum of each component was collected from the sliced section of the human carotid plaque obtained with endarterectomy and the optical characteristics were confirmed in several wavelengths. Based on this information, we assessed the diagnostic accuracy for ex vivo chemogram in each plaque component created with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), using multiple wavelengths. The chemogram projected on the actual image of plaque was created based on light intensity and transmittance change at three wavelengths. The wavelengths that were mainly were 1440, 1620, 1730, and 1930 nm. We evaluated the accuracy of histological diagnosis in chemogram compared with pathological findings, analyzing interobserver agreement with k-statistics. The chemograms that we created depicted the components of fibrous tissue, smooth muscle, lipid tissue, intraplaque hemorrhage, and calcification. Diagnostic odds ratio in each component was as follows: 259.6 in fibrous tissue, 144 in smooth muscle, 1123.5 in lipid tissue, 29.3 in intraplaque hemorrhage, and 136.3 in calcification.

Several machine learning methods are investigated, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a spectral-spatial classification framework based on support vector machines. Quantitative results demonstrate that additional data preprocessing and unsupervised segmentation can improve CNN results to achieve optimal performance. The methods are trained in two paradigms, with and without specular glare. Classifying regions that include specular glare degrade the overall results, but the combination of the CNN probability maps and unsupervised segmentation using a majority voting method produces an area under the curve value of 0.81 [0.80, 0.83]. As the wavelengths of light used in HSI can penetrate different depths into biological tissue, cancer margins may change with depth and create uncertainty in the ground truth. Through serial histological sectioning, the variance in the cancer margin with depth is investigated and paired with qualitative classification heat maps using the methods proposed for the testing group of SCC patients. The results determined that the validity of the top section alone as the ground truth may be limited to 1 to 2 mm.

Raman spectroscopy has shown its potential for non-invasive and label-free determination of bio-molecular compositions, aiding the post-mortem diagnosis of pathological tissue. Here, we investigated whether conventional Raman spectroscopy could be used for the detection of amyloid beta deposits in fixed, ex vivo human brain tissue, taken from the frontal cortex region. We examined the spectra and spectral maps of three severe AD cases and two healthy control cases and compared their spectral outcome among each other as well as to recent results in the literature obtained with various spectroscopic techniques. After hyperspectral Raman mapping, A\u03b2 plaques were visualized using Thioflavin-S staining on the exact same tissue sections. As a result, we show that tiny diffuse or tangled-like morphological structures, visible under microscopic conditions on unstained tissue and often but erroneously assumed to be deposits of A\u03b2, are instead usually an aggregation of highly auto-fluorescent lipofuscin granulates without any, or limited, plaque or plaque-like association. The occurrence of these auto-fluorescent particles is equally distributed in both AD and healthy control cases. Therefore, they cannot be used as possible criteria for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

This approach simulates spectral responses over 400 to 1100 nm. Comparing emulated data with full SFDS spectra of in-vivo tissue affords the opportunity to evaluate whether the sparse spectral content of these imagers can (1) account for all sources of optical contrast present (completeness) and (2) robustly separate and quantify sources of optical contrast (crosstalk).

In-vivo test cases (burn wounds and photoaging) illustrate how SFDS can be used to evaluate different multispectral imagers.

However, the resistance mechanisms have not been well understood due to a lack of suitable tools for dynamic observation of the interplay between antibiotics and biofilm. In this work, with the use of rapid hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering microscopy associated with an aryl-alkyne-based Raman tag synthesized, we investigate dynamic interactions between vancomycin and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) biofilm to gain new insights into the resistance mechanisms of the biofilm. Methods: We utilize spectral focusing hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering microscopy ensued with multivariate curve resolution analysis to spectrally decompose S. aureus biofilm into its major components (i.e., bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances). Concurrently, vancomycin is conjugated with aryl-alkyne Raman tag (Raman peak at 2218 cm-1) for in vivo tracking of its uptake into biofilm without tissue interference. Results: We find that vancomycin penetration is a non-uniform diffusion process with penetration depths limited by the preferential affinity to the cell clusters. Semi-quantitative analysis shows that the majority of vancomycin binds to the bacteria, achieving intracellular concentrations of up to 4- to 10- fold higher than the administered dosage. The diffusion constant of ~3.16 \u00b5m2/min based on the diffusion and antibiotic binding equations is obtained that well accounts for the antibiotic penetration into the biofilm. SRS longitudinal monitoring of antibiotic effect on the growth of biofilms shows that the antibiotics can eradicate the upper layer of the biofilm exposed to sufficient dosages, while the lower layer of the biofilm at a sub-inhibitory dose remains viable, eventually re-growing to significant bio-volume. Conclusion: The Raman-tagged hyperspectral SRS microscopy developed is a powerful imaging tool for dynamic monitoring of inhibitory effects of antibiotics on the growing biofilm in vivo, which would facilitate the formulation of new antibiotics for more effective treatments of bacterial infections in near future. \u00a9 Ivyspring International Publisher.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "In vivo three-dimensional evaluation of tumour hypoxia in nasopharyngeal carcinomas using FMT-CT and MSOT", "abstract": "Purpose: Accurate evaluation of hypoxia is particularly important in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) undergoing radiotherapy.

Methods: A carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)-specific molecular probe (CAIX-800) was developed for imaging of hypoxia. Mouse models of subcutaneous, orthotopic, and spontaneous lymph node metastasis from NPC (5 mice per group) were established to assess the imaging strategy. A multi-modality imaging method that consisted of a hybrid combination of fluorescence molecular tomography-computed tomography (FMT-CT) and multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) was used for 3D quantitative evaluation of tumour hypoxia. Magnetic resonance imaging, histological examination, and immunohistochemical analysis were used as references for comparison and validation. Results: In the early stage of NPC (2\u00a0weeks after implantation), FMT-CT enabled precise 3D localisation of the hypoxia biomarker with high sensitivity. At the advanced stage (6\u00a0weeks after implantation), MSOT allowed multispectral analysis of the biomarker and haemoglobin molecules with high resolution. The combination of high sensitivity and high resolution from FMT-CT and MSOT could not only detect hypoxia in small-sized NPCs but also visualise the heterogeneity of hypoxia in 3D. Conclusions: Integration of FMT-CT and MSOT could allow comprehensive and quantifiable evaluation of hypoxia in NPC. These findings may potentially benefit patients with NPC undergoing radiotherapy in the future.

RNA sequencing analysis of cancer cells recovered from tumors revealed that csMHCII correlated with response to anti- PD1 therapy, with immunotherapy-sensitive CMT167 cells being csMHCII positive, whereas resistant LLC cells were csMHCII negative. To test the functional effects of csMHCII, MHCII expression was altered on the cancer cells through loss- and gain-offunction of CIITA, a master regulator of the MHCII pathway. Loss of CIITA in CMT167 decreased csMHCII and converted tumors from anti-PD-1 sensitive to anti-PD-1 resistant. This was associated with lower levels of Th1 cytokines, decreased T cell infiltration, increased B cell numbers, and decreased macrophage recruitment. Conversely, overexpression of CIITA in LLC cells resulted in csMHCII in vitro and in vivo. Enforced expression of CIITA increased T cell infiltration and sensitized tumors to anti- PD-1 therapy. csMHCII expression was also examined in a subset of surgically resected human lung adenocarcinomas by multispectral imaging, which provided a survival benefit and positively correlated with T cell infiltration. These studies demonstrate a functional role for csMHCII in regulating T cell infiltration and sensitivity to anti-PD-1. \u00a9 2020 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Non-invasive in vivo hyperspectral imaging of the retina for potential biomarker use in Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "abstract": "Studies of rodent models of Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u00a0(AD) and of human tissues suggest that the retinal changes that occur in AD, including the accumulation of amyloid beta (A\u03b2), may serve as surrogate markers of brain A\u03b2 levels.

Here, we describe an optical-imaging instrument that integrates a visible multispectral imaging system with the detection of NIR-II and NIR-I (700\u2013900 nm in wavelength) fluorescence (by using the dye indocyanine green) for aiding the fluorescence-guided surgical resection of primary and metastatic liver tumours in 23 patients. We found that, compared with NIR-I imaging, intraoperative NIR-II imaging provided a higher tumour-detection sensitivity (100% versus 90.6%; with 95% confidence intervals of 89.1%\u2013100% and 75.0%\u201398.0%, respectively), a higher tumour-to-normal-liver-tissue signal ratio (5.33 versus 1.45) and an enhanced tumour-detection rate (56.41% versus 46.15%). We infer that combining the NIR-I/II spectral windows and suitable fluorescence probes might improve image-guided surgery in the clinic. \u00a9 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Distribution and Diffusion of Macromolecule Delivery to the Brain via Focused Ultrasound using Magnetic Resonance and Multispectral Fluorescence Imaging", "abstract": "Focused ultrasound (FUS), in combination with microbubble contrast agents, can be used to transiently open the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) to allow intravascular agents to cross into the brain. Often, FUS is carried out in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate BBB opening to gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents. Although MRI allows direct visualization of the distribution of gadolinium-based contrast agents in the brain parenchyma, it does not allow measurements of the distribution of other molecules crossing the BBB. Therapeutic molecules (e.g., monoclonal antibodies) are much different in size than MRI contrast agents and have been found to have different distributions in the brain after FUS-mediated BBB opening. In the work described here, we combined in vivo MRI and ex vivo multispectral fluorescence imaging to compare the distributions of MRI contrast and dextran molecules of different molecular weights (3, 70 and 500 kDa) after FUS-mediated BBB opening through a range of ultrasound pressures (0.18\u20130.46 MPa) in laboratory mice. The volume of brain exposed was calculated from the MRI and fluorescence images and was significantly dependent on both molecular weight and ultrasound pressure. Diffusion coefficients of the different-molecular-weight dextran molecules in the brain parenchyma were also calculated from the fluorescence images and were negatively correlated with the molecular weight of the dextran molecules. The results of this work build on a body of knowledge that is critically important for the FUS technique to be used in clinical delivery of therapeutics to the brain. \u00a9 2019 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "In-vivo and ex-vivo tissue analysis through hyperspectral imaging techniques: Revealing the invisible features of cancer", "abstract": "In contrast to conventional optical imaging modalities, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is able to capture much more information from a certain scene, both within and beyond the visual spectral range (from 400 to 700 nm). This imaging modality is based on the principle that each material provides different responses to light reflection, absorption, and scattering across the electromagnetic spectrum. Due to these properties, it is possible to differentiate and identify the different materials/substances presented in a certain scene by their spectral signature. Over the last two decades, HSI has demonstrated potential to become a powerful tool to study and identify several diseases in the medical field, being a non-contact, non-ionizing, and a label-free imaging modality. In this review, the use of HSI as an imaging tool for the analysis and detection of cancer is presented. The basic concepts related to this technology are detailed. The most relevant, state-of-the-art studies that can be found in the literature using HSI for cancer analysis are presented and summarized, both in-vivo and ex-vivo.

However, conventional systems are typically bulky and function with two cameras. To overcome these issues, we developed an economical home-built fluorescence imaging device based on a single RGB-IR sensor that can acquire both color and fluorescence images simultaneously. The technical feasibility of RGB-IR imaging was verified ex vivo in chicken breast tissue using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), cyanine 5 (Cy5), and indocyanine green (ICG) as fluorescent agents. The minimum sensitivities for FITC, Cy5, and ICG were 0.200 \u03bcM, 0.130 \u03bcM, and 0.065 \u03bcM, respectively. In addition, we validated the fluorescence imaging of this device in vitro during a minimally invasive procedure using smURFP-labeled probiotics, which emit a spectrum similar to that of Cy5. Our preliminary study of the ex vivo tissue suggests that Cy5 and ICG are good candidates for deep tissue imaging. In addition, the tumor-specific amplification process was visualized using cancer cells incubated with probiotics that had been labeled with a fluorescent protein.

Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound analysis is used to identify echo combinations with optimal signal-to-noise performance. Signal contributions are fit with a multispectral fluorine signal model using a non-linear least squares estimation reconstruction directly from k-space data. This CSE approach is tested in fluorine-19 phantoms and in a mouse with a 2D and 3D spoiled gradient-echo acquisition using multiple echo times determined from Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound analysis. Results: Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound analysis for PFCE and ISO separation shows signal-to-noise performance is maximized with a 0.33 ms echo separation. A linear behavior (R2 = 0.987) between PFCE signal and known relative PFCE volume is observed in CSE reconstructed images using a mixed PFCE/ISO phantom. Effective spatial and spectral separation of PFCE and ISO is shown in phantoms and in vivo.

Here, we aim to customize a label-free multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) method and systematically survey the fate of oxidized SWCNHs (SWCNHox) following different exposure routes by whole body imaging. Methods: Mice were given a suspension of SWCNHox with an average size of 136.4 nm via four different administration routes, and then imaged by MSOT. Results: After oral gavage, SWCNHox were mainly distributed in the gastrointestinal tract then excreted through the gut. Compared with the observation post first dosing, the accumulation of SWCNHox in the gastrointestinal tract was not obvious even after four-time oral gavage. Almost no SWCNHox were found at detectable levels in kidney, liver, blood and spleen. Following intravenous (iv) injection, SWCNHox were mainly presented and persisted in the spleen and liver, while very little in the kidney and almost none detectable in the intestine. SWCNHox accumulated significantly in the liver and spleen after four IV administrations. Following hypodermic and intramuscular injections, almost no SWCNHox could cross biological barriers and transport to the spleen, kidney or liver, likely due to their very low absorption rate. Almost all SWCNHox remained around the injection sites. For the first time, we have systematically investigated the in vivo fate of SWCNHs in a label-free and real-time manner. Conclusion: The findings of this study provide insights into the selection of appropriate exposure routes for potential biomedical applications of carbon nanomaterials. \u00a9 2019 Shi et al.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Measurement of absorption in scattering media using objective laser speckle: Application to blood oximetry", "abstract": "Multi-spectral imaging enables non-invasive sensing of chemical concentrations in biological tissue based on measurement of optical absorption, but invariably in the presence of high levels of scatter. Absorption is normally inferred from measurement of contrast of biological features, such as the vasculature, and so accuracy is degraded by the poorly characterized modulation-transfer function of the imaging optics and overlying tissue. We report how experimental characterization of the spectral variation of the tissue point-spread function and associated objective speckle pattern can be used to characterize the absorption spectrum and chromophore concentration, with a particular emphasis on determination of the ratio of oxygenated to deoxygenated hemoglobin within blood. Absorption measurements are determined purely by the geometry of the experiment, without degradation due to optical aberrations and associated light scatter. The technique offers enhanced and low-cost determination of in vitro or in vivo chromophore characterizations, including blood-gas analysis. \u00a9 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Glutathione-Mediated Clearable Nanoparticles Based on Ultrasmall Gd2O3 for MSOT/CT/MR Imaging Guided Photothermal/Radio Combination Cancer Therapy", "abstract": "Recently, multifunctional clearable inorganic theranostic nanoparticles have been attracting more and more attention.

In this work, ultrasmall gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3) nanoparticles, which possess the advantage of high longitudinal relaxation rate, were coated with bovine serum albumin (BSA). After the Gd2O3/BSA nanoparticles were linked with two-dimensional photothermal MoS2 nanomaterials, the nanoparticles were also modified with hyaluronic acid (HA) through the disulfide bonds for tumor-targeting effect. As indicated by in vitro and in vivo studies, these Gd2O3/BSA@MoS2-HA nanoparticles could be rapidly degraded and excreted after reacting with glutathione (GSH) by the redox response, thus avoiding long-term toxicity.

Herein, we propose a new approach to anatomical structure classification and image tagging that features an intrinsic measure of confidence to estimate its own performance with high reliability and which can be applied to both RGB and multispectral imaging (MI) data. Methods: Organ recognition is performed using a superpixel classification strategy based on textural and reflectance information. Classification confidence is estimated by analyzing the dispersion of class probabilities. Assessment of the proposed technology is performed through a comprehensive in vivo study with seven pigs. Results: When applied to image tagging, mean accuracy in our experiments increased from 65% (RGB) and 80% (MI) to 90% (RGB) and 96% (MI) with the confidence measure. Conclusion: Results showed that the confidence measure had a significant influence on the classification accuracy, and MI data are better suited for anatomical structure labeling than RGB data. Significance: This paper significantly enhances the state of art in automatic labeling of endoscopic videos by introducing the use of the confidence metric, and by being the first study to use MI data for in vivo laparoscopic tissue classification.

According to a quantitative in silico validation, our approach is well-suited for solving the inverse problem of relating multispectral image pixels to underlying functional tissue properties in real time. A porcine study further suggests that our method is capable of monitoring haemodynamic changes in vivo. Deep learning based multispectral imaging could thus become a valuable tool for imaging tissue dynamics. \u00a9 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Lung deposition patterns of MWCNT vary with degree of carboxylation", "abstract": "Functionalization of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) is known to affect the biological response (e.g. toxicity, inflammation) in vitro and in vivo.

Following a pilot study using seven variants, two f-MWCNT variants were chosen and for lung pathology and particle distribution using oropharyngeal aspiration administration of MWCNT in Balb/c mice. Particle distribution in the lung was examined at 7 and 28 days post-instillation by bright-field microscopy, CytoViva hyperspectral dark-field imaging, and Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) microscopy. Examination of the lung tissue by bright-field microscopy showed some acute inflammation for all MWCNT that was highest with source MWCNT. Hyperspectral imaging and SRS were employed to assess the changes in particle deposition and retention. Highly functionalized MWCNT had a higher lung burden and were more disperse. They also appeared to be associated more with epithelial cells compared to the source and less functionalized MWCNT that were mostly interacting with alveolar macrophages (AM). These results showing a slightly reduced pathology despite the extended deposition have implications for the engineering of safer MWCNT and may establish a practical use as a targeted delivery system. \u00a9 2018, \u00a9 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Transmission\u2013reflection optoacoustic ultrasound (TROPUS) computed tomography of small animals", "abstract": "Rapid progress in the development of multispectral optoacoustic tomography techniques has enabled unprecedented insights into biological dynamics and molecular processes in vivo and noninvasively at penetration and spatiotemporal scales not covered by modern optical microscopy methods.

In this review, we explore the potential of patient-derived explants (PDEs) for fulfilling this need. PDEs involve the ex vivo culture of fragments of freshly resected human tumours that retain the histological features of original tumours. PDE methodology for anti-cancer drug testing has been in existence for many years, but the platform has not been widely adopted in translational research facilities, despite strong evidence for its clinical predictivity. By modifying PDE endpoint analysis to include the spatial profiling of key biomarkers by using multispectral imaging, we argue that PDEs offer many advantages, including the ability to correlate drug responses with tumour pathology, tumour heterogeneity and changes in the tumour microenvironment.

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the suitability of the new rMSI technology for the detection of premalignant lesions and malignant BC in a preclinical mouse model using contrast agents. METHODS: Tumours were induced by N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN), which is known to induce BC in rodent models. In total, 30 mice (C57BL/6) were fed with 0.1% BBN ad libitum in drinking water for up to 5 months. Bladders were excised at 3 (n = 6) and 5 months (n = 24) of treatment and incubated ex vivo with Hexaminolevulinat (HAL, Hexvix\u00ae), CD47-FITC, CD90.2-FITC or a combination of CD90.2-FITC/CD47-FITC and HAL. The bladders were analyzed by an endoscopic rMSI prototype system equipped with a spectral filter (Chroma), a 4 mm endoscope (Karl Storz) with 30\u25e6 optic, a LED light source and a PC with a microcontroller board. RESULTS: 5-month treatment of mice with 0.1% BBN led to the formation of squamous carcinoma (46%, n = 11) while urothelial carcinoma was observed only in one mouse (4%, n = 1). Carcinoma in situ (CIS) was detectable in twelve out of twenty-four mice (50%, n = 12) treated for 5 month and in three out of six mice (50%, n = 3) treated for 3 months.The metabolite of HAL, protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), could be reliably and specifically detected in all of mouse bladder tumours and CIS. However, detection of the CD90.2 surface marker was less reliable, potentially due to species- or tumour-subtype specificity. \u00a9 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a\u00a0relatively new medical imaging procedure which has proven to be promising in tissue identification as well as in the analysis of tissue oxygenation and water content. Until now, no data exist on the in vivo HSI analysis of gastrointestinal anastomoses. Methods: Intraoperative images were obtained using the TIVITA\u2122 tissue system HSI camera from Diaspective Vision GmbH (Pepelow, Germany). In 47\u00a0patients who underwent gastrointestinal surgery with esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, small bowel or colorectal anastomoses, 97\u00a0assessable recordings were generated. Parameters obtained at the sites of the anastomoses included tissue oxygenation (StO2), the tissue hemoglobin index (THI), near-infrared (NIR) perfusion index, and tissue water index (TWI). Results: Obtaining and analyzing the intraoperative images with this non-invasive imaging system proved practicable and delivered good results on a\u00a0consistent basis. A\u00a0NIR gradient along and across the anastomosis was observed and, furthermore, analysis of the tissue water and oxygenation content showed specific changes at the site of anastomosis. Conclusion: The HSI method provides a\u00a0non-contact, non-invasive, intraoperative imaging procedure without the use of a\u00a0contrast medium, which enables a\u00a0real-time analysis of physiological anastomotic parameters, which may contribute to determine the \u201dideal\u201c anastomotic region.

For these operations, it is of utmost importance to remove the whole tumor, since tumor-positive resection margins may result in recurrent disease and impaired overall survival. Current optical imaging techniques using endogenous contrast - e.g. diffuse reflectance spectroscopy or optical coherence tomography - for detection of breast cancers are limited to point measurements or long acquisition times. Broadband hyperspectral cameras, which provide a complete spectral fingerprint of the object at pixel level, are needed for two-dimensional imaging of the operative region. An ex vivo study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of hyperspectral imaging for breast cancer detection. Fresh (<3 hours after surgery) resected breast cancer slices were imaged with a snapshot hyperspectral camera, which has 41 spectral bands, equally distributed in the visible and near-infrared (VIS-NIR) range (450 - 950 nm). Supervised analysis was performed by using the pathology annotations and unsupervised analysis was performed by using the hierarchical stochastic neighbour embedding (h-SNE) algorithm. So far, nine resected specimens, of which six invasive carcinomas and two (partially) mucinous carcinomas, were imaged. Spectral differences were found between the non-tumor, malign and benign regions on the resected specimens. Furthermore, automatic feature classification using h-SNE was possible in selected cases. Hyperspectral imaging showed great potential for discrimination of benign and malign breast tissue by using specific wavelengths bands in an ex vivo setting. Further analysis will be performed to determine whether it is possible to select tumor-specific wavelengths. \u00a9 2019 SPIE.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Multispectral MRI with dual fluorinated probes to track mononuclear cell activity in mice", "abstract": "Background: MRI with fluorine 19 (19F) probes has shown an ability to track immune cell activity with a specific, stable, and quantitative signal. In addition, the chemical shift differences of selected 19F probes make dual-probe imaging possible. To improve 19F MRI sensitivity for dual-probe imaging, optimal fluorine probes are needed. Purpose: To develop multispectral 19F MRI to image immune cell activity in vivo using 19F nanoparticles of two distinct fluorocarbons. Materials and Methods: Both 19F nanoparticles formulated with two fluorocarbons with distinct resonance frequencies and a high fluorine payload were characterized in terms of size, stability, MR profile, and relaxation times at 7 T. 19F MRI sensitivity was tested on labeling cells both in vitro and in vivo in C57BL/6 mice after conditional ablation of myeloid cells through the inhibition of colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1Ri) to monitor the change of immune cells phagocytosis. Fluorine MRI data were acquired at the resonance frequency of each fluorocarbon by using a three-dimensional fast spin-echo sequence. Fluorescent dyes were also inserted into 19F nanoparticles to allow flow-cytometric and confocal microscopy analysis of labeled cells. Fluorine signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) was compared by using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc correction. Results: Fluorine MRI demonstrated high sensitivity and high specificity in the imaging of mononuclear cells both in vitro and in vivo. In combination with proton MRI, a map of 19F nuclei from each fluorocarbon was obtained without overlaps or artifacts. In vitro cell viability was unchanged, and 8000 cells with a high SNR (.8) were detected. In vivo high fluorine signal was observed in the bone marrow (SNR . 15) immediately after CSF1Ri treatment interruption, which correlated with high uptake by neutrophils and monocytes at flow cytometry. Conclusion: By assessing in vivo MRI of mononuclear cell phagocytic ability with 19F nanoparticles, MRI with dual 19F probes can effectively track immune cell activity in combination with current MRI protocols. \u00a9 RSNA, 2019.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Rod-shape MSN@MoS2 nanoplatform for FL/MSOT/CT imaging-guided photothermal and photodynamic therapy", "abstract": "Rod-shape nanoplatform have received tremendous attention owing to their enhanced ability for cell internalization and high capacity for drug loading. MoS2, widely used in electronic devices, electrocatalysis, sensor and energy-storage, has been studied as photothermal agents over the years. However, the efficacy of rod-shape MoS2 based photothermal agents for photothermal therapy has not been studied before. Here, a near-infrared (NIR) light-absorbing MoS2 nanosheets coated mesoporous silica nanorods with human serum albumin (HSA) modifying and Ce6 loading (MSNR@MoS2-HSA/Ce6) were constructed for combined photothermal and photodynamic therapy. Methods: The near-infrared (NIR) light was used to trigger the synergistic anti-tumor therapy. In addition, breast cancer cell line was applied to evaluate the in vitro anti-tumor activity. The multi-modal imaging capacity and tumor-killing efficiency of the designed nanocomposites in vivo was also demonstrated with the 4T1 tumor-bearing mouse model. Results: These nanocomposites could not only perform NIR light triggered photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), but also achieve in vivo fluorescence (FL) /multispectral optical tomography (MSOT)/X-ray computed tomography (CT) triple-model bioimaging. What's more, the rod-shape nanoplatform could be endowed with better anti-tumor ability based on the EPR effect and HSA-mediated active tumor targeting. At the same time, the hyperthermia generated by MoS2 could synergistically improve the PDT effect with the acceleration of the blood flow, leading to the increase of the oxygen level in tumor tissue.

To overcome this challenge, we are developing a fast-tuning, multispectral photoacoustic approach to guiding neurological procedures. An ex vivo porcine sciatic nerve and caprine carotid artery perfused with whole human blood were suspended in a water bath. A spectroscopic analysis with wavelengths 690 nm to 1260 nm was performed on each specimen with a constant optical energy of 1.5 mJ/pulse and 11 mJ/pulse for a 1 mm diameter optical fiber and a 5 mmm diameter fiber bundle, respectively. The contrast and signal-to-noise ratio of each target was calculated from photoacoustic images, with wavelength-dependent contrast values and signal-to-noise ratios that ranged from 0.41 to 21.8 dB and 10.12 to 25.6 dB, respectively. In particular, the blood vessel contrast (18.2 dB) was greater than the nerve contrast (0.61 dB) when excited with 750 nm light. However, the nerve contrast (10.7 dB) was greater than the blood vessel contrast (6.6 dB) when excited with 1230 nm light. These results indicate that simultaneous visualization of major vessels and nerves requires an imaging system that exploits the unique optical absorption peaks of both hemoglobin and lipids by fast-tuning between 750 nm and 1230 nm excitation wavelengths. \u00a9 2019 SPIE.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Non-invasive Reporter Gene Imaging of Cell Therapies, including T Cells and Stem Cells", "abstract": "Cell therapies represent a rapidly emerging class of new therapeutics.

Aim: The aim of this work is to investigate the performances of HSI for this specific application as well as to assess key factors for the future design and operation of a benchtop system. Approach: The MC framework, based on Mesh-based Monte Carlo (MMC), reproduces a section of the exposed cortex of a mouse from an in vivo image and replicates hyperspectral illumination and detection at multiple NIR wavelengths (up to 121). Results: The results demonstrate: (1) the fitness of the MC framework to correctly simulate hyperspectral data acquisition; (2) the capability of HSI to reconstruct spatial changes in the concentrations of HbO2, HHb, and oxCCO during a simulated hypoxic condition; (3) that eight optimally selected wavelengths between 780 and 900 nm provide minimal differences in the accuracy of the hyperspectral results, compared to the \"gold standard\" of 121 wavelengths; and (4) the possibility to mitigate partial pathlength effects in the reconstructed data and to enhance quantification of the hemodynamic and metabolic responses.

Short wavelength infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral imaging is currently becoming an important supplement to spectroscopy in optical diagnostics due to the flexibility and adaptability of the technique. However, due to the complexity of hyperspectral data, the analysis requires a well planned approach. In this paper a simple but effective approach combining dimension reduction and unsupervised classification is suggested. Examples of in vivo hyperspectral data in the SWIR spectral range (950-2500 nm) from human skin bruises and porcine skin burns are presented as examples. Data are processed using the minimum noise fraction transform (MNF), and K-means clustering. K-means clustering was found to perform significantly better if applied to MNF transformed data. The classification results agree well with biopsies, spectral data and visual inspection of injuries. It is thus shown that unsupervised clustering can be a preferable technique in cases where it is challenging to use or interpret results from physics based models, or where the ground truth is lacking or not well defined. The presented results confirm that SWIR hyperspectral imaging indeed is a useful tool for optical characterization of tissue. \u00a9 2019 SPIE.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "In situ preparation of gold-polyester nanoparticles for biomedical imaging", "abstract": "The synthesis and application of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have attracted much attention due to their interesting optical and chemical properties, as well as their utility in imaging, therapeutics, sensors, electronics, and catalysis.

Here, we report the one-step synthesis of gold-polyester nanoparticles for use as an imaging agent. The AuNPs were prepared inside polymeric NPs by means of ultraviolet irradiation of a gold salt in the presence of Irgacure I-2959 photoinitiator. We monitored the kinetic growth and nucleation of AuNPs (in vitro and ex vivo) over time using spectral analysis. Moreover, we investigated the cytotoxicity, localized plasmonic surface resonance (LSPR), and cellular imaging capabilities of the Au-polyester nanoparticles. The resulting Au-polyester NPs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to probe their chemical structure, size, zeta potential (\u03b6), and morphology, respectively. Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed that the NP formulation is stable over time and exhibits negligible toxicity against 3T3 fibroblast and U-87 MG glioblastoma cells. The results also demonstrated that the Au-polyester NPs exhibit excellent cellular imaging properties.

Methods: Tumor hypoxia can cleave the azo linker and release a NIR fluorophore (NR-NH2) and release the active drug as well. NR-NH2 shows a strong absorption band at around 680 nm and a strong fluorescence band at 710 nm, allowing for both multispectral optoacoustic tomography imaging (MSOT) and fluorescent imaging of tumor hypoxia in a tumor-bearing mouse model. Results: Liposome encapsulated with the activatable chromophore (NR-azo) for detecting/imaging tumor hypoxia and for tumor inhibition was demonstrated. For this chromophore, a xanthene-based NIR fluorophore acts as the optoacoustic and fluorescent reporter, an azo linker serves as the hypoxia-responsive moiety and a nitrogen mustard as the therapeutic drug. NR-azo shows an absorption at around 575 nm but exhibits negligible fluorescence due to the existence of the strong electron-withdrawing azo linker.

Systemic inflammation is considered to be a key driver of cancer cachexia; however, clinical studies with anti-inflammatory drugs failed to show distinct cachexia-inhibiting effects. To address this contradiction, we investigated the functional importance of innate immune cells for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-associated cachexia. Methods: A transgenic HCC mouse model was intercrossed with mice harbouring a defect in myeloid cell-mediated inflammation. Body composition of mice was analysed via nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and microcomputed tomography. Quantitative PCR was used to determine adipose tissue browning and polarization of adipose tissue macrophages. The activation state of distinct areas of the hypothalamus was analysed via immunofluorescence. Multispectral immunofluorescence imaging and immunoblot were applied to characterize sympathetic neurons and macrophages in visceral adipose tissue. Quantification of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mouse serum was performed with a multiplex immunoassay. Visceral adipose tissue of HCC patients was quantified via the L3 index of computed tomography scans obtained during routine clinical care. Results: We identified robust cachexia in the HCC mouse model as evidenced by a marked loss of visceral fat and lean mass. Computed tomography-based analyses demonstrated that a subgroup of human HCC patients displays reduced visceral fat mass, complementing the murine data. While the myeloid cell-mediated inflammation defect resulted in reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum of HCC-bearing mice, this unexpectedly did not translate into diminished but rather enhanced cachexia-associated fat loss. Defective myeloid cell-mediated inflammation was associated with decreased macrophage abundance in visceral adipose tissue, suggesting a role for local macrophages in the regulation of cancer-induced fat loss. Conclusions: Myeloid cell-mediated inflammation displays a rather unexpected beneficial function in a murine HCC model. These results demonstrate that immune cells are capable of protecting the host against cancer-induced tissue wasting, adding a further layer of complexity to the pathogenesis of cachexia and providing a potential explanation for the contradictory results of clinical studies with anti-inflammatory drugs. \u00a9 2019 The Authors Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Society on Sarcopenia, Cachexia and Wasting Disorders", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Multispectral autoflourescence detection of skin neoplasia using steady-state techniques", "abstract": "In the current study were used excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS) steady-state techniques in a broad spectral regions (excitation at 220-500 nm and emission at 280-850 nm) to achieve the whole set of endogenous fluorophores, existed in normal and neoplastic cutaneous tissues.

Properties such as nanotube type (single-walled vs. multi-walled), purity, length, aggregation state, and functionalization, as well as route of administration, greatly affect both the biocompatibility and biodistribution of carbon nanotubes. These differences suggest that generalizable conclusions may be elusive and that studies must be material- and application-specific. Here, we assess the short- and long-term biodistribution and biocompatibility of a single-chirality DNA-encapsulated single-walled carbon nanotube complex upon intravenous administration that was previously shown to function as an in-vivo reporter of endolysosomal lipid accumulation.

In the current ex vivo study, we evaluated the feasibility of hyperspectral diffuse reflectance imaging (HSI) for distinguishing tumor from the healthy tongue tissue. Study Design/Materials and Methods: Fresh surgical specimens (n = 14) of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue were scanned with two hyperspectral cameras that cover the visible and near-infrared spectrum (400\u20131,700 nm). Each pixel of the hyperspectral image represents a measure of the diffuse optical reflectance. A neural network was used for tissue-type prediction of the hyperspectral images of the visual and near-infrared data sets separately as well as both data sets combined. Results: HSI was able to distinguish tumor from muscle with a good accuracy. The diagnostic performance of both wavelength ranges (sensitivity/specificity of visual and near-infrared were 84%/80% and 77%/77%, respectively) appears to be comparable and there is no additional benefit of combining the two wavelength ranges (sensitivity and specificity were 83%/76%).

This is anticipated as EGFR exists in two distinct populations in cells, cell membrane bound and internalized, activated protein. iPAI is a promising new method for quantifying intracellular proteins in a rapid tumor model on the chicken CAM. \u00a9 2019 SPIE.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Ex vivo hyperspectral autofluorescence imaging and localization of fluorophores in human eyes with age-related macular degeneration", "abstract": "To characterize fluorophore signals from drusen and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and their changes in age related macular degeneration (AMD), the authors describe advances in ex vivo hyperspectral autofluorescence (AF) imaging of human eye tissue. Ten RPE flatmounts from eyes with AMD and 10 from eyes without AMD underwent 40\u00d7 hyperspectral AF microscopic imaging. The number of excitation wavelengths tested was initially two (436 nm and 480 nm), then increased to three (436 nm, 480 nm, and 505 nm). Emission spectra were collected at 10 nm intervals from 420 nm to 720 nm. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithms decomposed the hyperspectral images into individual emission spectra and their spatial abundances. These include three distinguishable spectra for RPE fluorophores (S1, S2, and S3) in both AMD and non-AMD eyes, a spectrum for drusen (SDr) only in AMD eyes, and a Bruch\u2019s membrane spectrum that was detectable in normal eyes. Simultaneous analysis of datacubes excited atthree excitation wavelengths revealed more detailed spatial localization of the RPE spectra and SDr within drusen than exciting only at two wavelengths. Within AMD and non-AMD groups, two different NMF initialization methods were tested on each group and converged to qualitatively similar spectra. In AMD, the peaks of the SDr at ~510 nm (436 nm excitation) were particularly consistent. Between AMD and non-AMD groups, corresponding spectra in common, S1, S2, and S3, also had similar peak locations and shapes, but with some differences and further characterization warranted. \u00a9 2020, MDPI AG.

There is a clinical need to develop non-invasive techniques that can provide reliable assistance for tumor resection in real-time during surgical procedures. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) arises as a new, noninvasive and non-ionizing technique that can assist neurosurgeons during this difficult task. In this paper, we explore the use of deep learning (DL) techniques for processing hyperspectral (HS) images of in-vivo human brain tissue. We developed a surgical aid visualization system capable of offering guidance to the operating surgeon to achieve a successful and accurate tumor resection. The employed HS database is composed of 26 in-vivo hypercubes from 16 different human patients, among which 258,810 labelled pixels were used for evaluation. The proposed DL methods achieve an overall accuracy of 95% and 85% for binary and multiclass classifications, respectively. The proposed visualization system is able to generate a classification map that is formed by the combination of the DL map and an unsupervised clustering via a majority voting algorithm. This map can be adjusted by the operating surgeon to find the suitable configuration for the current situation during the surgical procedure. \u00a9 2019 SPIE.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Assessment of gold-coated iron oxide nanoparticles as negative T2 contrast agent in small animal MRI studies", "abstract": "Purpose: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents are pharmaceuticals that enable a better visualization of internal body structures. In this study, we present the synthesis, MRI signal enhancement capabilities, in vitro as well as in vivo cytotoxicity results of gold-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4@AuNPs) as potential contrast agents. Methods: Fe3O4@AuNPs were obtained by synthesizing iron oxide nanoparticles and gradually coating them with gold. The obtained Fe3O4@AuNPs were characterized by spectroscopies, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray diffraction. The effect of the nanoparticles on the MRI signal was tested using a 7T Bruker PharmaScan system. Cytotoxicity tests were made in vitro on Fe3O4@AuNP-treated retinal pigment epithelium cells by WST-1 tests and in vivo by following histopathological changes in rats after injection of Fe3O4@AuNPs. Results: Stable Fe3O4@AuNPs were successfully prepared following a simple and fast protocol (<1h worktime) and identified using TEM. The cytotoxicity tests on cells have shown biocompatibility of Fe3O4@AuNPs at small concentrations of Fe (<1.95\u00d710\u22128 mg/ cell). Whereas, at higher Fe concentrations (eg 7.5\u00d710\u22128 mg/cell), cell viability decreased to 80.88\u00b15.03%, showing a mild cytotoxic effect. MRI tests on rats showed an optimal Fe3O4 @AuNPs concentration of 6mg/100g body weight to obtain high-quality images. The histopathological studies revealed significant transient inflammatory responses in the time range from 2 hours to 14 days after injection and focal cellular alterations in several organs, with the lung being the most affected organ. These results were confirmed by hyperspectral microscopic imaging of the same, but unstained tissues. In most organs, the inflammatory responses and sublethal cellular damage appeared to be transitory, except for the kidneys, where the glomerular damage indicated progression towards glomerular sclerosis. Conclusion: The obtained stable, gold covered, iron oxide nanoparticles with reduced cytotoxicity, gave a negative T2 signal in the MRI, which makes them suitable for candidates as contrast agent in small animal MRI applications. \u00a9 2020 Iancu et al.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Tissue oxygen level in acute and chronic wound: A comparison study", "abstract": "Adequate oxygen supply to granulating tissue and its surroundings is considered as an elementary factor to render an optimum condition for proper wound healing.

Intense Raman signals were obtained due to the high density of alkyne, cyanide, azide, and carbon-deuterate in single nanoparticles, in absence of metal (such as Au or Ag) as Raman enhancers. We have developed a library of Raman beads for frequency multiplexing through the end-capping substitutions of monomers and demonstrated five-color SRS imaging of mixed nanoparticles with distinct Raman frequencies. In addition, with further surface functionalization of targeting moieties (such as nucleic acid aptamers and targeting peptides), targetable Raman beads were successfully used as probes for tumor targeting and Raman spectroscopic detection, including multicolor SRS imaging in living tumor cells and tissues with high specificity. Further in vivo studies indicated that Raman beads anchored with targeting moieties were successfully employed to target tumors in living mice after tail intravenous injection, and Raman spectral detection of tumor in live mice was achieved only through spontaneous Raman signal at the biological Raman-silent region without any signal enhancement due to a high density of Raman reporters in Raman beads.

This study investigates the performance of label-free, reflectance-based hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and autofluorescence imaging for SCC detection at the cancer margin in excised tissue specimens from 102 patients and uses fluorescent dyes for comparison. Fresh surgical specimens (n = 293) were collected during H and N SCC resections (n = 102). The tissue specimens were imaged with reflectance-based HSI and autofluorescence imaging and afterwards with two fluorescent dyes for comparison. A histopathological ground truth was made. Deep learning tools were developed to detect SCC with new patient samples (inter-patient) and machine learning for intra-patient tissue samples. Area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operator characteristic was used as the main evaluation metric. Additionally, the performance was estimated in mm increments circumferentially from the tumor-normal margin. In intra-patient experiments, HSI classified conventional SCC with an AUC of 0.82 up to 3 mm from the cancer margin, which was more accurate than proflavin dye and autofluorescence (both p < 0.05). Intra-patient autofluorescence imaging detected human papilloma virus positive (HPV+) SCC with an AUC of 0.99 at 3 mm and greater accuracy than proflavin dye (p < 0.05). The inter-patient results showed that reflectance-based HSI and autofluorescence imaging outperformed proflavin dye and standard red, green, and blue (RGB) images (p < 0.05). In new patients, HSI detected conventional SCC in the larynx, oropharynx, and nasal cavity with 0.85\u20130.95 AUC score, and autofluorescence imaging detected HPV+ SCC in tonsillar tissue with 0.91 AUC score.

Methods: The used hyperspectral camera is able to record light spectra from 500 to 1000\u00a0nm and provides information about physiologic parameters of the recorded tissue area intraoperatively (e.g., tissue oxygenation and perfusion). We performed an open-label, single-arm, and non-randomized intervention clinical trial to compare clinical assessment and hyperspectral measurement to define the resection margin in 24 patients before and after separation of the marginal artery over 15\u00a0min; HSI was performed each minute to assess the parameters mentioned above. Results: The false color images calculated from the hyperspectral data visualized the margin of perfusion in 20 out of 24 patients precisely. In the other four patients, the perfusion difference could be displayed with additional evaluation software. In all cases, there was a deviation between the transection line planed by the surgeon and the border line visualized by HSI (median 1\u00a0mm; range \u2212 13 to 13\u00a0mm). Tissue perfusion dropped up to 12% within the first 10\u00a0mm distal to the border line. Therefore, the resection area was corrected proximally in five cases due to HSI record. The biggest drop in perfusion took place in less than 2\u00a0min after devascularization.

Moreover, we observe BAT composition differences between healthy and diabetic tissues. The study consolidates hemoglobin as a principal label-free biomarker for longitudinal non-invasive imaging of BAT morphology and bioenergetics in situ. We also resolve water and fat components in volunteers, and contrast MSOT readouts with magnetic resonance imaging data. Reber et al. employed label-free multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography to non-invasively image BAT and WAT in mice and humans and resolve BAT activation based on hemoglobin gradients. The 700\u2013970 nm spectral range further enabled identification of BAT composition using lipid and water signatures. \u00a9 2018 Elsevier Inc.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "In vivo multimodal optical biopsy of skin cancer", "abstract": "A multimodal method for skin cancer diagnosis based on Dermatoscopy image analysis, Hyperspectral Imaging.

The development of a non-contact and label-free method to provide reliable support for tumor resection in real-time during neurosurgical procedures is a current clinical need. Hyperspectral imaging is a non-contact, non-ionizing, and label-free imaging modality that can assist surgeons during this challenging task without using any contrast agent. In this work, we present a deep learning-based framework for processing hyperspectral images of in vivo human brain tissue. The proposed framework was evaluated by our human image database, which includes 26 in vivo hyperspectral cubes from 16 different patients, among which 258,810 pixels were labeled. The proposed framework is able to generate a thematic map where the parenchymal area of the brain is delineated and the location of the tumor is identified, providing guidance to the operating surgeon for a successful and precise tumor resection. The deep learning pipeline achieves an overall accuracy of 80% for multiclass classification, improving the results obtained with traditional support vector machine (SVM)-based approaches. In addition, an aid visualization system is presented, where the final thematic map can be adjusted by the operating surgeon to find the optimal classification threshold for the current situation during the surgical procedure. \u00a9 2019 by the authors.

Oral epithelial dysplasia and cancer development is accompanied by morphological, biochemical, and metabolic tissue and cellular alterations that can modulate the autofluorescence properties of the oral epithelial tissue. Objective: This study aimed to test the hypothesis that autofluorescence biomarkers of oral precancer and cancer can be clinically imaged and quantified by means of multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) endoscopy. Methods: Multispectral autofluorescence lifetime images of precancerous and cancerous lesions from 39 patients were imaged in vivo using a novel multispectral FLIM endoscope and processed to generate widefield maps of biochemical and metabolic autofluorescence biomarkers of oral precancer and cancer. Results: Statistical analyses applied to the quantified multispectral FLIM endoscopy based autofluorescence biomarkers indicated their potential to provide contrast between precancerous/cancerous vs. healthy oral epithelial tissue. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first demonstration of label-free biochemical and metabolic clinical imaging of precancerous and cancerous oral lesions by means of widefield multispectral autofluorescence lifetime endoscopy.

Although animal studies show that certain nanomaterials can cross the skin barrier, physiological differences between human and animal skin, such as the lack of sweat glands, limit the translational validity of these results. Current optical microscopy methods have limited capabilities to visualize ENMs within human skin tissues due to the high amount of background light scattering caused by the dense, ubiquitous extracellular matrix (ECM) of the skin. Here, we hypothesized that organic solvent-based tissue clearing (\u201cimmunolabeling-enabled three-dimensional imaging of solvent-cleared organs\u201d, or \u201ciDISCO\u201d) would reduce background light scattering from the extracellular matrix of the skin to sufficiently improve imaging contrast for both 2D mapping of unlabeled metal oxide ENMs and 3D mapping of fluorescent nanoparticles.

MPDA-WS2@MnO2, the resultant nanoplatforms, exhibit radiosensitization enhanced behavior and a capacity for responsive oxygen self-supplementation. The ingenious mesoporous structure of MPDA NSs serves as reservoir for the assembly of WS2 QDs to form MPDA-WS2 nanoparticles (NPs), in which WS2 QDs provide the radiation enhancement effect, whereas the MPDA NSs framework endows the MPDA-WS2@MnO2 with an excellent photothermal capability. Additionally, the integration of the MnO2 component works to decompose the tumor-overexpressed H2O2 and alleviate tumor hypoxia subsequently, which has been demonstrated to enhance radiotherapy performance considerably. Meanwhile, the prepared MPDA-WS2@MnO2 nanoplatforms have been evaluated as trimodality contrast agents for computed tomography (CT), multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), and tumor microenvironment-responsive T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging that have the potential for real-time guidance and monitoring during cancer therapy.

We developed a non-invasive, real-time, label-free imaging technique for assessing the level of ROS in live cells and thawed cryopreserved tissues that is compatible with in-vivo imaging. The technique is based on autofluorescence multispectral imaging (AFMI) carried out in an adapted fluorescence microscope with an expanded number of spectral channels spanning specific excitation (365 nm\u2013495 nm) and emission (420 nm\u2013700 nm) wavelength ranges. We established a strong quantitative correlation between the spectral information obtained from AFMI and the level of ROS obtained from CellROX staining. The results were obtained in several cell types (HeLa, PANC1 and mesenchymal stem cells) and in live kidney tissue. Additioanly,two spectral regimes were considered: with and without UV excitation (wavelengths > 400 nm); the latter being suitable for UV-sensitive systems such as the eye. Data were analyzed by linear regression combined with an optimization method of swarm intelligence. This allowed the calibration of AFMI signals to the level of ROS with excellent correlation (R = 0.84, p = 0.00) in the entire spectral range and very good correlation (R = 0.78, p = 0.00) in the limited, UV-free spectral range. We also developed a strong classifier which allowed us to distinguish moderate and high levels of ROS in these two regimes (AUC = 0.91 in the entire spectral range and AUC = 0.78 for UV-free imaging). These results indicate that ROS in cells and tissues can be imaged non-invasively, which opens the way to future clinical applications in conditions where reactive oxygen species are known to contribute to progressive disease such as in ophthalmology, diabetes, kidney disease, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. \u00a9 2020 The Authors", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Long-term Risk Assessment for Medical Application of Cold Atmospheric Pressure Plasma", "abstract": "Despite increasing knowledge gained based on multidisciplinary research, plasma medicine still raises various questions regarding specific effects as well as potential risks.

In validation experiments, excellent agreement is observed in diffuse reflectance measurements between the spectral camera setup and a spectrometer. To demonstrate that such spectral image data can yield meaningful optical measurements in vivo, the forearms of eight volunteers are imaged in the system. Their data are then analyzed to estimate the tissue optical properties of different skin layers using a Monte Carlo lookup table. In three volunteers, spectral images are captured before and after inducing erythema using a warm wet towel. Across the three subjects, a clear increase in the blood content of the superficial plexus layer was observed as a result of the erythema.

In the present study, EDF-HSI was used to screen cosmetic inventories for the presence of nano silver (nAg), nano gold (nAu), and nano titanium dioxide (nTiO2). In addition, we also assessed the potential of EDF-HSI as a tool to detect NM in skin layers following application of NM products in vitro on commercially available artificial skin constructs (ASCs) and in vivo on albino hairless SKH-1 mouse skin. Spectroscopic analysis positively detected nAu (4/9 products) and nTiO2 (7/13 products), but no nAg (0/6 products) in a subset of the cosmetics. The exposure of ASCs for 24 h in a Franz diffusion cell system to a diluted cosmetic containing nTiO2 revealed penetrance of nTiO2 through the epidermal layers and was detectable in the receptor fluid. Moreover, both single and multiple applications of nTiO2 containing cosmetics on the dorsal surface of SKH-1 mice resulted in detectable levels of trace nTiO2 in the layers of the skin indicating that penetrance of NM was occurring after each application of the product. The current study demonstrates the sensitivity of EDF-HSI with SAM mapping for qualitative detection of NM present in cosmetic products per se and very low levels in complex biological matrices on which these products are applied. \u00a9 Published 2020 by the American Chemical Society.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Clinical Biophotonics", "abstract": "The roceedings contain 9 papers.

A methodology based on optimization algorithms has been proposed for this task, identifying the relevant wavelengths to achieve the best accuracy in the classification results obtained by a supervised classifier (support vector machines), and employing the lowest possible number of spectral bands.

MSOT identified cancer-free SLNs in vivo and ex vivo without a single false negative (189 total lymph nodes), with 100% sensitivity and 48 to 62% specificity. Our findings indicate that a noninvasive, nonradioactive MSOT-based approach can identify and determine SLN status and confidently rule out the presence of metastasis.

These reflectances encode information on important physiological parameters not visible to the naked eye. Fast decoding of the data during surgery, however, remains challenging. While model-based methods suffer from inaccurate base assumptions, a major bottleneck related to competing machine learning-based solutions is the lack of labelled training data. In this paper, we address this issue with the first transfer learning-based method to physiological parameter estimation from multispectral images. It relies on a highly generic tissue model that aims to capture the full range of optical tissue parameters that can potentially be observed in vivo. Adaptation of the model to a specific clinical application based on unlabelled in vivo data is achieved using a new concept of domain adaptation that explicitly addresses the high variance often introduced by conventional covariance-shift correction methods. According to comprehensive in silico and in vivo experiments our approach enables accurate parameter estimation for various tissue types without the need for incorporating specific prior knowledge on optical properties and could thus pave the way for many exciting applications in multispectral laparoscopy. \u00a9 Springer International Publishing AG 2017.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Multi-wavelength analysis of synthetic tissue samples by optical feedback interferometry", "abstract": "Optical feedback interferometry is being increasingly applied to imaging of both inorganic and organic samples, especially in the infrared spectral region where imaging detectors are expensive or bulky.

We interrogated whether handheld multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) could noninvasively monitor the effect of VTP using WST11, a vascular-acting photosensitizer, on tumor tissues over time using a renal cell cancer mouse model. We also investigated whether MSOT illumination can induce VTP, to implement a single-modality theranostic approach. Materials and Methods: Eight BalB/c mice were subcutaneously implanted with murine renal adenocarcinoma cells (RENCA) on the flank. Three weeks later VTP was performed (10 min continuous illumination at 753 nm following intravenous infusion) using WST11 or saline as control. Handheld MSOT images were collected prior to VTP administration and subsequently thereafter over the course of the first hour, at 24 and 48 h. Data collected were unmixed for blood oxygen saturation in tissue (SO2) based on the spectral signatures of deoxy- and oxygenated hemoglobin. Changes in oxygen saturation over time, relative to baseline, were examined by paired t-test for statistical significance (p < 0.05). In-vivo findings were corroborated by histological analyses of the tumor tissue. Results: MSOT is shown to prominently resolve changes in oxygen saturation in tumors within the first 20 min post WST11-VTP treatment. Within the first hour post-treatment, SO2 decreased by more than 60% over baseline (p < 0.05), whereas it remained unchanged (p > 0.1) in the sham-treated group. Moreover, unlike in the control group, SO2 in treated tumors further decreased over the course of 24 to 48 h post-treatment, concomitant with the propagation of profound central tumor necrosis present in histological analysis. We further show that pulsed MSOT illumination can activate WST11 as efficiently as the continuous wave irradiation employed for treatment. Conclusion: Handheld MSOT non-invasively monitored WST11-VTP effects based on the SO2 signal and detected blood saturation changes within the first 20 min post-treatment. MSOT may potentially serve as a means for both VTP induction and real-time VTP monitoring in a theranostic approach. \u00a9 Ivyspring International Publisher.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Model of artificial metastasis of human epidermoid carcinoma A431 in nude mice for the examination of oncolytic activity of the vaccinia virus", "abstract": "Human carcinoma A431 cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice at points remote from each other. One of the two xenografts developed afterwards was used for the treatment with a recombinant vaccinia virus, while the other xenograft served as an artificial metastasis. We used the attenuated recombinant vaccinia virus (VACV) VVdGF-GFP2 of the L-IVP strain (GenBank accession number KP233807) with the deletion of two virulence genes, i.e., the genes of the virus growth factor and thymidine kinase, with the gene for the green fluorescent protein (GFP2) inserted in the place of the latter. The treatment was performed by a single intratumoral injection of recombinant VACV at a dose of 107 PFU/mouse. VACV was detected in cells of the artificial metastasis as early as two days after infection. After eight days, the virus concentration was comparable with that in the infected tumor (~109 PFU/mL). Electron microscopy revealed selective replication of the recombinant virus in the tumor cells. The targeted accumulation of GFP2 in both tumor and metastasis was shown in the UV images of the mice obtained using the In-vivo Multispectral Imaging System (Bruker, Germany). The complete destruction of the tumor was detected after 12 days, and that of metastasis, after 20 days after the injection of VVdGF-GFP2. The destruction process was accompanied by pronounced edema and leukocyte infiltration of the tumor tissue. The recombinant virus induced a significant reduction in the sizes of the tumor and metastasis. By the end of the experiment (35 days), the xenografts in the control mice were 10 times larger than those in the treated mice (5000 vs 500 mm3). Our study has shown that the attenuated VACV administered by the peripheral route can not only destroy the primary tumor but also has a distinct antimetastatic effect. \u00a9 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Injection-seeded Raman fiber amplifier for photoacoustic microscopy of lipids", "abstract": "Photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) of lipid-rich tissue requires laser pulses with a wavelength near 1210 nm. We have previously demonstrated a cost-effective alternative using cascaded stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in an optical fiber. An optical fiber pumped by a compact 1047 nm pulsed laser produces multiple Stokes lines at 1098, 1153, 1215, and 1284 nm. Disadvantages of this system are the fixed wavelength and broad spectral linewidth of each Stokes line. In this paper, we explore a technique to overcome these disadvantages by injection-seeding the Raman fiber amplifier. Our pump laser is a 1047 nm 2.5 kHz Q-switched Nd:YLF laser producing 14 ns pulses with 140 uJ of energy. The seed laser is a 1206 nm multimode diode laser with a 3 nm linewidth. All experiments are performed in a 100 meter long single-mode fiber. When the seed laser is present, the third Stokes line occurs at 1206 nm (11 nm linewidth). Without the seed laser, the third Stokes line occurs at 1215 nm (30 nm linewidth). The pulse energy in both cases is approximately 9 uJ. Multispectral PAM experiments are performed at 1047, 1098, 1153, 1206, and 1274 nm. A thin butter strip between 1 mm thick pieces of chicken breast meat is clearly visualized by our system, as well the fat bodies within Drosophila larva fixed in formalin. Our injection-seeded Raman amplifier has the capability of producing 1195 to 1220 nm laser pulses by tuning the seed laser wavelength. Therefore, we believe this system can benefit many in vivo PAM applications of lipid imaging. \u00a9 2016 IEEE.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Spiral volumetric optoacoustic tomography visualizes multi-scale dynamics in mice", "abstract": "Imaging dynamics at different temporal and spatial scales is essential for understanding the biological complexity of living organisms, disease state and progression.

Experimental Design: A clinical study was conducted in order to collect and image fresh, surgical specimens from patients (N = 36) with head and neck cancers undergoing surgical resection. A set of machine-learning tools were developed to quantify hyperspectral images of the resected tissue in order to detect and delineate cancerous regions which were validated by histopathologic diagnosis. More than two million reflectance spectral signatures were obtained by HSI and analyzed using machine-learning methods. The detection results of HSI were compared with autofluorescence imaging and fluorescence imaging of two vital-dyes of the same specimens. Results: Quantitative HSI differentiated cancerous tissue from normal tissue in ex vivo surgical specimens with a sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 91%, respectively, and which was more accurate than autofluorescence imaging (P < 0.05) or fluorescence imaging of 2-NBDG (P < 0.05) and proflavine (P < 0.05). The proposed quantification tools also generated cancer probability maps with the tumor border demarcated and which could provide real-time guidance for surgeons regarding optimal tumor resection. Conclusions: This study highlights the feasibility of using quantitative HSI as a diagnostic tool to delineate the cancer boundaries in surgical specimens, and which could be translated into the clinic application with the hope of improving clinical outcomes in the future. \u00a92017 AACR.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Photo acoustic imaging: Technology, systems and market trends", "abstract": "Although the Photo Acoustic effect was observed by Graham Bell in 1880, the first applications (gas analysis) occurred in 1970's using the required energetic light pulses from lasers.

While ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used as a guidance modality, it often provides insufficient contrast for identifying nerves from surrounding tissues such as tendons. Electrical nerve stimulators can be used in conjunction with US imaging for discriminating nerves from surrounding tissues, but they are insufficient to reliably prevent neural punctures, so that alternative methods are highly desirable. In this study, an interventional multispectral photoacoustic (PA) imaging system was used to directly compare the signal amplitudes and spectra acquired from nerves and tendons ex vivo, for the first time. The results indicate that the system can provide significantly higher image contrast for discriminating nerves and tendons than that provided by US imaging.

Materials and Methods: The study was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. Sequential MSOT was performed in a mouse B16F10 melanoma limb lymph node metastasis model (n = 13) to survey the development of macro-, micro- And in-transit metastases (metastases that are in transit from the primary tumor site to the local nodal basin) in vivo. The in vitro limit of detection was assessed in a B16F10 cell phantom. Signal specificity was determined on the basis of a simultaneous lymphadenitis (n = 4) and 4T1 breast cancer lymph metastasis (n = 2) model. MSOT was compared with intravenous FDG PET/CT. The diagnosis was assessed with histologic examination. Differences in the signal ratio (metastatic node to contralateral limb) between the two modalities were determined with the two-tailed paired t test. Results: The mean signal ratios acquired with MSOT in micrometastases (2.5 \u00b1 0.3, n = 6) and in-transit metastases (8.3 \u00b1 5.8, n = 4) were higher than those obtained with FDG PET/CT (1.1 \u00b1 0.5 [P < .01] and 1.3 \u00b1 0.6 [P > .05], respectively). MSOT was able to help differentiate even small melanoma lymph node metastases from the other lymphadenopathies (P < .05 for both) in vivo, whereas FDG PET/CT could not (P . .1 for both). In vitro, the limit of detection was at an approximate cell density of five cells per microliter (P > .01).

Objective: To develop the next generation of visualization catheters that can reveal irreversible atrial muscle damage caused by ablation and identify viability gaps between the lesions. Methods: Radiofrequency lesions were placed on the endocardial surfaces of excised human and bovine atria and left ventricles of blood perfused rat hearts. Tissue was illuminated with 365nm light and a series of images were acquired from individual spectral bands within 420- 720nm range. By extracting spectral profiles of individual pixels and spectral unmixing, the relative contribution of ablated and unablated spectra to each pixel was then displayed. Results of spectral unmixing were compared to lesion pathology. Results: RF ablation caused significant changes in the tissue autofluorescence profile. The magnitude of these spectral changes in human left atrium was relatively small (> 10% of peak fluorescence value), yet highly significant. Spectral unmixing of hyperspectral datasets enabled high spatial resolution, in-situ delineation of radiofrequency lesion boundaries without the need for exogenous markers. Lesion dimensions derived from hyperspectral imaging approach strongly correlated with histological outcomes. Presence of blood within the myocardium decreased the amplitude of the autofluorescence spectra while having minimal effect on their overall shapes. As a result, the ability of hyperspectral imaging to delineate ablation lesions in vivo was not affected. Conclusions: Hyperspectral imaging greatly increases the contrast between ablated and unablated tissue enabling visualization of viability gaps at clinically relevant locations. Data supports the possibility for developing percutaneous hyperspectral catheters for high-resolution ablation guidance. \u00a9 2016 Muselimyan et al.

The advantage of this approach is that it requires no modification to existing surgical and diagnostic endoscopic imaging systems. Our method uses a radiometric color calibration of the endoscopic camera's sensor in conjunction with a Bayesian framework to recover a per-pixel measurement of the total blood volume (THb) and oxygen saturation (SO2) in the observed tissue. The sensor's pixel measurements are modeled as weighted sums over a mixture of Poisson distributions and we optimize the variables SO2 and THb to maximize the likelihood of the observations. To validate our technique, we use synthetic images generated from Monte Carlo physics simulation of light transport through soft tissue containing sub-surface blood vessels. We also validate our method on in vivo data by comparing it to a MSI dataset acquired with a hardware system that sequentially images multiple spectral bands without overlap. Our results are promising and show that we are able to provide surgeons with additional relevant information by processing endoscopic images with our modeling and inference framework. \u00a9 1982-2012 IEEE.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Towards multispectral endoscopic imaging of cardiac lesion assessment and classification for cardiac ablation therapy", "abstract": "Pulmonary vein (PV) isolation is a critical procedure for the treatment and termination of atrial fibrillation (AF).

Working with hyperspectral images in vivo, however, is not straightforward as the high dimensionality of the data makes real-time processing challenging. In this paper, a novel dimensionality reduction scheme and a new processing pipeline are introduced to obtain a detailed tumor classification map for intra-operative margin definition during brain surgery. However, existing approaches to dimensionality reduction based on manifold embedding can be time consuming and may not guarantee a consistent result, thus hindering final tissue classification. The proposed framework aims to overcome these problems through a process divided into two steps: dimensionality reduction based on an extension of the T-distributed stochastic neighbor approach is first performed and then a semantic segmentation technique is applied to the embedded results by using a Semantic Texton Forest for tissue classification. Detailed in vivo validation of the proposed method has been performed to demonstrate the potential clinical value of the system. \u00a9 1982-2012 IEEE.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Gd3+ tethered gold nanorods for combined magnetic resonance imaging and photo-thermal therapy", "abstract": "Near infrared (NIR) mediated photothermal therapy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are promising treatment and imaging modalities in the field of cancer theranostics.

Similarly, gadolinium based MRI contrast agents have an ability to increase the ionic and molecular relaxivity, thereby enhancing the solvent proton relaxation rate resulting in contrast enhancement. Herein, the effort has been made to engineer a dual front theranostic agent with combined photothermal and magnetic resonance imaging capacity using gadolinium tethered gold nanorods (Gd3+-AuNR). NIR-responsive gold nanorods were surface fabricated by means of Au-thiol interaction using a thiolated macrocyclic chelator that chelates Gd3+ ions, and further stabilized by thiolated polyethylene glycol (PEG-SH). The magnetic properties of the Gd3+-AuNR displayed an enhanced r1 relaxivity of 12.1 mM-1s-1, with higher biological stability, and contrast enhancement in both solution state and in cell pellets. In-vitro (cell-free) and ex-vivo (on pig skin) analysis of the Gd3+-AuNR shows enhanced photothermal properties as equivalent to that of the raw AuNR. Furthermore, Gd3+-AuNR showed competent cellular entry and intracellular distribution as revealed by hyperspectral microscopy. In addition, Gd3+-AuNR also exhibits significant thermal ablation of B16-F10 cells in the presence of NIR.

Voxels with susceptibility estimates above a predetermined threshold are identified as metal. The accuracy of the estimated susceptibility and implant geometry was evaluated in simulations, phantom, and in vivo experiments. Results: The proposed method provided more accurate susceptibility estimation compared with a previous method without TV regularization, in both simulations and phantom experiments. In the phantom experiment where the actual implant was 40% of the signal-void region, the mean estimated susceptibility was close to the susceptibility in literature, and the precision and recall of the estimated geometry was 85% and 93%. In vivo studies in subjects with hip implants also demonstrated that the proposed method can distinguish implants from surrounding low-signal tissues, such as cortical bone. Conclusion: The proposed method can improve the delineation of metallic implant geometry by distinguishing metal voxels from artificial signal voids and low-signal tissues by estimating the susceptibility maps.

The spectral profile of near infrared excitation light used in optoacoustic tomography instruments is modified by absorption and scattering as it propagates deep into biological tissue. The resulting images therefore provide only qualitative insight into the distribution of tissue chromophores. Knowledge of the spectral profile of excitation light across the mouse is needed for accurate determination of the absorption coefficient in vivo. Under the conditions of constant Grueneisen parameter and accurate knowledge of the light fluence, a linear relationship should exist between the initial optoacoustic pressure amplitude and the tissue absorption coefficient. Using data from a commercial optoacoustic tomography system, we implemented an iterative optimization based on the \u03c3-Eddington approximation to the Radiative Transfer Equation to derive a light fluence map within a given object. We segmented the images based on the positions of phantom inclusions, or mouse organs, and used known scattering coefficients for initialization. Performing the fluence correction in simple phantoms allowed the expected linear relationship between recorded and independently measured absorption coefficients to be retrieved and spectral coloring to be compensated. For in vivo data, the correction resulted in an enhancement of signal intensities in deep tissues. This improved our ability to visualize organs at depth (> 5mm). Future work will aim to perform the optimization without data normalization and explore the need for methodology that enables routine implementation for in vivo imaging. \u00a9 2016 SPIE.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Innovation and fusion of X-ray and optical tomography for mouse studies of breast cancer", "abstract": "For early detection and targeted therapy, receptor expression profiling is instrumental to classifying breast cancer into sub-groups. In particular, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression has been shown to have both prognostic and predictive values. Recently, an increasingly more complex view of HER2 in breast cancer has emerged from genome sequencing that highlights the role of inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity in therapy resistance. Studies on such heterogeneity demand high-content, high-resolution functional and molecular imaging in vivo, which cannot be achieved using any single imaging tool. Clearly, there is a critical need to develop a multimodality approach for breast cancer imaging. Since 2006, grating-based x-ray imaging has been developed for much-improved x-ray images. In 2014, the demonstration of fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) guided by x-ray grating-based micro-CT was reported with encouraging results and major drawbacks. In this paper, we propose to integrate grating-based x-ray tomography (GXT) and high-dimensional optical tomography (HOT) into the first-of-its-kind truly-fused GXT-HOT (pronounced as \"Get Hot\") system for imaging of breast tumor heterogeneity, HER2 expression and dimerization, and therapeutic response. The primary innovation lies in developing a brand-new high-content, high-throughput x-ray optical imager based on several contemporary techniques to have MRI-type soft tissue contrast, PET-like sensitivity and specificity, and micro-CT-equivalent resolution. This system consists of two orthogonal x-ray Talbot-Lau interferometric imaging chains and a hyperspectral time-resolved single-pixel optical imager.

Fundus images were taken with a custom hyperspectral camera with a spectral range of 460\u2013630 nm. We determined retinal vascular oxygen saturation (sO2) for the healthy population using the captured spectra by least squares curve fitting. Additionally, macular pigment optical density was localized and visualized using multispectral reflectometry from selected wavelengths. Results: We successfully determined the mean sO2 of arteries and veins of each subject (ages 21\u201380) with excellent intrasubject repeatability (1.4% standard deviation). The mean arterial sO2 for all subjects was 90.9% \u00b1 2.5%, whereas the mean venous sO2 for all subjects was 64.5% \u00b1 3.5%.

Intracarotid injection of liposomes was performed in separate cohorts of both healthy and C6 glioma-bearing Sprague Dawley rats after induction of transient cerebral hypoperfusion. Large (200\u00a0nm) and small (60\u201380\u00a0nm) fluorescent dye-loaded liposomes that were either cationic or neutral in surface charge were utilized. Delivery effectiveness was quantitatively measured both with real-time, in vivo and postmortem diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Semi-quantitative multispectral fluorescence imaging was also utilized to assess the pattern and extent of liposome targeting within tumors. Large cationic liposomes demonstrated the most effective hemispheric and glioma targeting of all the liposomes tested. Selective large cationic liposome retention at the site of glioma growth was observed. The liposome deposition pattern within tumors after intraarterial injection was variable with both core penetration and peripheral deposition observed in specific tumors.

In this study, we demonstrate the ability of our imaging system to discriminate between healthy and damaged porcine epidermal tissue. Healthy porcine epidermal tissue samples (n=11) were imaged ex vivo using our hyperspectral system. The amount of NAD(P)H emission and the reflectance properties were approximately constant across the surface of healthy tissue samples. The tissue samples were then thermally damaged using an 1850 nm thulium fiber laser and re-imaged after laser irradiation. The damaged regions were clearly visible in the hyperspectral images as the thermal damage altered the fluorescent emission of NAD(P)H and changed the scattering properties of the tissue. The extent of the damaged regions was determined based on the hyperspectral images and these estimates were compared to damage extents measured in white light images acquired with a traditional camera. The extent of damage determined via hyperspectral imaging was in good agreement with estimates based on white light imaging indicating that our system is capable of differentiating between healthy and damaged tissue.

The performances of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) and gold nanorods (GNRs), which have been verified as excellent photoacoustic contrast agents, were compared with that of the Pdots based on the multiscale PAI system. Both ex vivo and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the Pdots have better photoacoustic conversion efficiency at 532 nm than GNPs and showed similar photoacoustic performance with GNRs at 700 nm at the same mass concentration. Photostability and toxicity tests demonstrated that the Pdots are photostable and biocompatible.

Up until now, HSI has been used in conjunction with rigid endoscopy to detect cancer in vivo. The logical next step is to pair HSI with flexible endoscopy, since it improves access to hard-to-reach areas. While the flexible endoscope\u2019s fiber optic cables provide the advantage of flexibility, they also introduce an interfering honeycomb-like pattern onto images. Due to the substantial impact this pattern has on locating cancerous tissue, it must be removed before the HS data can be further processed. Thereby, the loss of information is to minimize avoiding the suppression of small-area variations of pixel values. We have developed a system that uses flexible endoscopy to record HS cubes of the larynx and designed a special filtering technique to remove the honeycomb-like pattern with minimal loss of information. We have confirmed its feasibility by comparing it to conventional filtering techniques using an objective metric and by applying unsupervised and supervised classifications to raw and pre-processed HS cubes. Compared to conventional techniques, our method successfully removes the honeycomb-like pattern and considerably improves classification performance, while preserving image details. \u00a9 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Conjugation of fiber-coupled wide-band light sources and acousto-optical spectral elements", "abstract": "Endoscopic instrumentation is widely used for diagnostics and surgery.

Current imaging technologies are particularly limited when it comes to detecting very small tumors in vivo, i.e., very early cancers or metastases, differentiating viable tumor from surrounding dead tumor tissue, and evaluating tumor metabolism within tissue. Optoacoustic imaging offers potential solutions to these imaging problems because of its ability to image optical absorption properties of both intrinsic tissue chromophores and exogenous contrast agents without the involvement of ionizing radiation. Optoacoustic imaging uses pulsed laser to induce localized thermoelastic expansion that generates acoustic waves detectable by an ultrasound transducer. To date, multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) has primarily been used in preclinical research; however, its use in translational and clinical research is expanding.

Undetected residual malignant tissue often results in the need for additional treatment or surgical intervention. The Solaris platform is a multispectral open-air fluorescence imaging system designed for translational fluorescence-guided surgery. Solaris supports video-rate imaging in four fixed fluorescence channels ranging from visible to near infrared, and a multispectral channel equipped with a liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF) for multispectral image acquisition (520-620 nm). Identification of tumor margins using reagents emitting in the visible spectrum (400-650 nm), such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), present challenges considering the presence of auto-fluorescence from tissue and food in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. To overcome this, Solaris acquires LCTF-based multispectral images, and by applying an automated spectral unmixing algorithm to the data, separates reagent fluorescence from tissue and food auto-fluorescence. The unmixing algorithm uses vertex component analysis to automatically extract the primary pure spectra, and resolves the reagent fluorescent signal using non-negative least squares. For validation, intraoperative in vivo studies were carried out in tumor-bearing rodents injected with FITC-dextran reagent that is primarily residing in malignant tissue 24 hours post injection. In the absence of unmixing, fluorescence from tumors is not distinguishable from that of surrounding tissue. Upon spectral unmixing, the FITC-labeled malignant regions become well defined and detectable. The results of these studies substantiate the multispectral power of Solaris in resolving FITC-based agent signal in deep tumor masses, under ambient and surgical light, and enhancing the ability to surgically resect them. \u00a9 2017 SPIE.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Probe-based rapid hybrid hyperspectral and tissue surface imaging aided by fully convolutional networks", "abstract": "Tissue surface shape and reflectance spectra provide rich intraoperative information useful in surgical guidance.

An alternative proposed in this work to overcome these limitations is the use of NIR dye-loaded nanoparticles.

The prepared nanoparticles exhibited good colloidal stability and adequate optical properties for optoacoustic imaging. The in vivo biodistribution assays indicated a strong accumulation of the particles in the liver and spleen, and retention in these organs for at least 24h. Therefore, these nanoparticles could find promising applications in MSOT due to a sharp and characteristic optoacoustic spectrum and high optoacoustic signal generation, and become a promising building block for theranostic strategies. \u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "A tissue factor-cascade-targeted strategy to tumor vasculature: A combination of EGFP-EGF1 conjugation nanoparticles with photodynamic therapy", "abstract": "Tumor requires tumor vasculature to supply oxygen and nutrients so as to support its continued growth, as well as provide a main route for metastatic spread.

The aim of this study is to assess the possibility of performing hyperspectral imaging of in vivo cerebral oxyhemoglobin (HbO2), deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) and oxidized CCO (oxCCO) using commercially available HSI devices.

As a more effective method to localize soft tissue targets, we developed an online bioluminescence tomography (BLT) system for small-animal radiation research platform (SARRP). We demonstrated BLT-guided radiation therapy and validated targeting accuracy based on a newly developed reconstruction algorithm. Methods and Materials The BLT system was designed to dock with the SARRP for image acquisition and to be detached before radiation delivery. A 3-mirror system was devised to reflect the bioluminescence emitted from the subject to a stationary charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Multispectral BLT and the incomplete variables truncated conjugate gradient method with a permissible region shrinking strategy were used as the optimization scheme to reconstruct bioluminescent source distributions. To validate BLT targeting accuracy, a small cylindrical light source with high CBCT contrast was placed in a phantom and also in the abdomen of a mouse carcass. The center of mass (CoM) of the source was recovered from BLT and used to guide radiation delivery. The accuracy of the BLT-guided targeting was validated with films and compared with the CBCT-guided delivery. In vivo experiments were conducted to demonstrate BLT localization capability for various source geometries. Results Online BLT was able to recover the CoM of the embedded light source with an average accuracy of 1 mm compared to that with CBCT localization. Differences between BLT- and CBCT-guided irradiation shown on the films were consistent with the source localization revealed in the BLT and CBCT images. In vivo results demonstrated that our BLT system could potentially be applied for multiple targets and tumors.

The importance of neurovascular cross-talk in the central nervous system has recently come into focus with the growing awareness that these two systems interact extensively both during development, in the stem-cell niche, and in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. With respect to the peripheral nervous system, however, there have been no live, real-time investigations of the potential relationship between these two developing systems. To address this deficit, we used multispectral 4D time-lapse imaging in a transgenic quail model in which endothelial cells (ECs) express a yellow fluorescent marker, while neural crest cells (NCCs) express an electroporated red fluorescent marker. We monitored EC and NCC migration in real-time during formation of the peripheral nervous system. Our time-lapse recordings indicate that NCCs and ECs are physically juxtaposed and dynamically interact at multiple locations along their trajectories. These interactions are stereotypical and occur at precise anatomical locations along the NCC migratory pathway. NCCs migrate alongside the posterior surface of developing intersomitic vessels, but fail to cross these continuous streams of motile ECs. NCCs change their morphology and migration trajectory when they encounter gaps in the developing vasculature. Within the nascent dorsal root ganglion, proximity to ECs causes filopodial retraction which curtails forward persistence of NCC motility. Overall, our time-lapse recordings support the conclusion that primary vascular networks substantially influence the distribution and migratory behavior of NCCs and the patterned formation of dorsal root and sympathetic ganglia. \u00a9 2016.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Intraoperative video-rate hemodynamic response assessment in human cortex using snapshot hyperspectral optical imaging", "abstract": "Using light, we are able to visualize the hemodynamic behavior of the brain to better understand neurovascular coupling and cerebral metabolism.

Results: Smooth spectra S1 to S3, with perinuclear localization consistent with LF/ML at all three retinal locations and both excitations in 14 eyes (84 datasets), were included in the analysis.

In this study, we synthesized, characterized, and investigated the in vivo fate of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide-based polymer conjugates with a drug model bound via a disulfide bond, which is frequently cited in the literature as being completely stable in the bloodstream but readily cleaved after cell internalization. The concept was based on a \"dual\" labeling of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymers with two different fluorescent dyes, where the first dye was linked via a disulfide bond, thus representing a model drug, while the second dye was attached as an amide and served as a label for the polymer carrier. Two conjugates, differing in their molecular weights (30 and 104 kDa), were examined using a multispectral optical imaging technique in athymic nude mice inoculated with HT-29 and DLD-1 human colon carcinoma xenografts. Additionally, necropsied organs and tumors were examined ex vivo to obtain more detailed information about polymer and model drug biodistribution. In vivo results confirmed preferential tumor accumulation for both conjugates. Moreover, different fluorescence patterns for the polymer and drug model were observed in both mice and necropsied tumors, indicating tumor-specific \"drug\" release. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2016.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "A hyperspectral vessel image registration method for blood oxygenation mapping", "abstract": "Blood oxygenation mapping by the means of optical oximetry is of significant importance in clinical trials. This paper uses hyperspectral imaging technology to obtain in vivo images for blood oxygenation detection. The experiment involves dorsal skin fold window chamber preparation which was built on adult (8\u00b110 weeks of age) female BALB/c nu/nu mice and in vivo image acquisition which was performed by hyperspectral imaging system. To get the accurate spatial and spectral information of targets, an automatic registration scheme is proposed. An adaptive feature detection method which combines the local threshold method and the level-set filter is presented to extract target vessels. A reliable feature matching algorithm with the correlative information inherent in hyperspectral images is used to kick out the outliers. Then, the registration images are used for blood oxygenation mapping. Registration evaluation results show that most of the false matches are removed and the smooth and concentrated spectra are obtained. This intensity invariant feature detection with outliers-removing feature matching proves to be effective in hyperspectral vessel image registration. Therefore, in vivo hyperspectral imaging system by the assistance of the proposed registration scheme provides a technique for blood oxygenation research. \u00a9 2017 Wang et al.

To our knowledge, there have been no studies directly comparing MDSLA and RCM. Objective We conducted a repeated measures analysis comparing the sensitivity and specificity of MDSLA and RCM in the detection of melanoma (n = 55 lesions from 36 patients). Methods Study patients (n = 36) with atypical-appearing pigmented lesions (n = 55) underwent imaging by both RCM and MDSLA. Lesions were biopsied and analyzed by histopathology. Results RCM exhibited superior test metrics (P = .001, McNemar test) compared with MDSLA. Respectively, sensitivity measures were 85.7% and 71.4%, and specificity rates were 66.7% and 25.0%. Limitations The sample size was relatively small and was collected from only one dermatologist's patient base; there was some degree of dermatopathologist interobserver variability; and only one confocalist performed the RCM image evaluations.

The ill-posedness of the FMT inverse problem makes it difficult to reconstruct and resolve multiple adjacent fluorescent targets that have different functional features but are labeled with the same fluorochrome. An algorithm based on independent component analysis (ICA) for multispectral excited FMT is proposed to resolve multiple fluorescent targets in this study. Fluorescent targets are excited by multispectral excitation, and the three-dimensional distribution of fluorescent yields under the excitation spectrum is reconstructed by an iterative Tikhonov regularization algorithm. Subsequently, multiple fluorescent targets are resolved from mixed fluorescence signals by employing ICA. Simulations were performed and the results demonstrate that multiple adjacent fluorescent targets can be resolved if the number of excitation wavelengths is not smaller than that of fluorescent targets with different concentrations. The algorithm obtains both independent components that provide spatial information of different fluorescent targets and spectral courses that reflect variation trends of fluorescent yields along with the excitation spectrum. By using this method, it is possible to visualize the metabolism status of drugs in different structure organs, and quantitatively depict the variation trends of fluorescent yields of each functional organ under the excitation spectrum. This method may provide a pattern for tumor detection, drug delivery and treatment monitoring in vivo. \u00a9 2016 SPIE.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Proceedings - 2017 International Seminar on Sensor, Instrumentation, Measurement and Metrology: Innovation for the Advancement and Competitiveness of the Nation, ISSIMM 2017", "abstract": "The proceedings contain 39 papers.

Mortality is due to diagnosis of 75% of women with late stage disease, when metastasis is already present. EOC is characterized by diffuse and widely disseminated intra-peritoneal metastasis. Cells shed from the primary tumor anchor in the mesothelium that lines the peritoneal cavity as well as in the omentum, resulting in multi-focal metastasis, often in the presence of peritoneal ascites. Efforts in our laboratory are directed at a more detailed understanding of factors that regulate EOC metastatic success. However, quantifying metastatic tumor burden represents a significant technical challenge due to the large number, small size and broad distribution of lesions throughout the peritoneum. Herein we describe a method for analysis of EOC metastasis using cells labeled with red fluorescent protein (RFP) coupled with in vivo multispectral imaging. Following intraperitoneal injection of RFP-labelled tumor cells, mice are imaged weekly until time of sacrifice. At this time, the peritoneal cavity is surgically exposed and organs are imaged in situ. Dissected organs are then placed on a labeled transparent template and imaged ex vivo. Removal of tissue auto-fluorescence during image processing using multispectral unmixing enables accurate quantitation of relative tumor burden. This method has utility in a variety of applications including therapeutic studies to evaluate compounds that may inhibit metastasis and thereby improve overall survival. \u00a9 2016 Journal of Visualized Experiments.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Fluorescent Ly6G antibodies determine macrophage phagocytosis of neutrophils and alter the retrieval of neutrophils in mice", "abstract": "Fluorescently labeled Ly6G antibodies enable the tracking of neutrophils in mice, whereas purified anti-Ly6G rapidly depletes neutrophils from the circulation. The mechanisms underlying neutrophil depletion are still under debate. Here, we examined how identical Ly6G antibodies coupled to different fluorochromes affect neutrophil fate in vivo. BM cells stained with Ly6G antibodies were injected into mice. The number of retrieved anti-Ly6G-FITC+ cells was reduced significantly in comparison with anti-Ly6G-APC+ or anti-Ly6G-PE+ cells. Flow cytometry and multispectral imaging flow cytometry analyses revealed that anti-Ly6G-FITC+ neutrophils were preferentially phagocytosed by BMMs in vitro and by splenic, hepatic, and BM macrophages in vivo. Direct antibody injection of anti-Ly6G-FITC but not anti-Ly6G-PE depleted neutrophils to the same degree as purified anti-Ly6G, indicating that the FITC-coupled antibody eliminates neutrophils by a similar mechanism as the uncoupled antibody. With the use of a protein G-binding assay, we demonstrated that APC and PE but not FITC coupling inhibited access to interaction sites on the anti-Ly6G antibody. We conclude the following: 1) that neutrophil phagocytosis by macrophages is a central mechanism in anti-Ly6G-induced neutrophil depletion and 2) that fluorochrome-coupling can affect functional properties of anti-Ly6G antibodies, thereby modifying macrophage uptake of Ly6G-labeled neutrophils and neutrophil retrieval following adoptive cell transfer or injection of fluorescent anti-Ly6G. \u00a9 Society for Leukocyte Biology.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Targeting acidity in pancreatic Adenocarcinoma: Multispectral Optoacoustic tomography detects ph-low insertion peptide probes in vivo", "abstract": "Background: pH-low insertion peptides (pHLIP) can serve as a targeting moiety that enables pH-sensitive probes to detect solid tumors. Using these probes in conjunction with multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is a promising approach to improve imaging for pancreatic cancer. Methods: A pH-sensitive pHLIP (V7) was conjugated to 750 NIR fluorescent dye and evaluated as a targeted probe for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The pH-insensitive K7 pHLIP served as an untargeted control. Probe binding was assessed in vitro at pH 7.4, 6.8, and 6.6 using human pancreatic cell lines S2VP10 and S2013. Using MSOT, semiquantitative probe accumulation was then assessed in vivo with a murine orthotopic pancreatic adenocarcinoma model. Results: In vitro, the V7-750 probe demonstrated significantly higher fluorescence at pH 6.6 compared with pH 7.4 (S2VP10, P = 0.0119; S2013, P = 0.0160), whereas no difference was observed with the K7-750 control (S2VP10, P = 0.8783; S2013, P = 0.921). In the in vivo S2VP10 model, V7-750 probe resulted in 782.5 MSOT a.u. signal compared with 5.3 MSOT a.u. in K7-750 control in tumor (P = 0.0001). Similarly, V7-750 probe signal was 578.3MSOT a.u. in the S2013 model compared with K7-750 signal at 5.1 MSOT a.u. (P = 0.0005). There was minimal off-Target accumulation of the V7-750 probe within the liver or kidney, and probe distribution was confirmed with ex vivo imaging. Conclusions: Compared with pH-insensitive controls, V7-750 pH-sensitive probe specifically targets pancreatic adenocarcinoma and has minimal off-Target accumulation. The noninvasive detection of pH-Targeted probes by means of MSOT represents a promising modality to improve the detection and monitoring of pancreatic cancer. \u00a9 2015 American Association for Cancer Research.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Automated spectroscopic tissue classification in colorectal surgery", "abstract": "Background. In colorectal surgery, detecting ureters and mesenteric arteries is of utmost importance to prevent iatrogenic injury and to facilitate intraoperative decision making. A tool enabling ureter- and artery-specific image enhancement within (and possibly through) surrounding adipose tissue would facilitate this need, especially during laparoscopy. To evaluate the potential of hyperspectral imaging in colorectal surgery, we explored spectral tissue signatures using single-spot diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). As hyperspectral cameras with silicon (Si) and indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) sensor chips are becoming available, we investigated spectral distinctive features for both sensor ranges. Methods. In vivo wide-band (wavelength range 350-1830 nm) DRS was performed during open colorectal surgery. From the recorded spectra, 36 features were extracted at predefined wavelengths: 18 gradients and 18 amplitude differences. For classification of respectively ureter and artery in relation to surrounding adipose tissue, the best distinctive feature was selected using binary logistic regression for Si- and InGaAs-sensor spectral ranges separately. Classification performance was evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation. Results. In 10 consecutive patients, 253 spectra were recorded on 53 tissue sites (including colon, adipose tissue, muscle, artery, vein, ureter). Classification of ureter versus adipose tissue revealed accuracy of 100% for both Si range and InGaAs range. Classification of artery versus surrounding adipose tissue revealed accuracies of 95% (Si) and 89% (InGaAs). Conclusions. Intraoperative DRS showed that Si and InGaAs sensors are equally suited for automated classification of ureter versus surrounding adipose tissue. Si sensors seem better suited for classifying artery versus mesenteric adipose tissue. Progress toward hyperspectral imaging within this field is promising. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2015.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Towards quantitative evaluation of tissue absorption coefficients using light fluence correction in optoacoustic tomography", "abstract": "Optoacoustic tomography is a fast developing imaging modality, combining the high contrast available from optical excitation of tissue with the high resolution and penetration depth of ultrasound detection. Light is subject to both absorption and scattering when traveling through tissue; adequate knowledge of tissue optical properties and hence the spatial fluence distribution is required to create an optoacoustic image that is directly proportional to chromophore concentrations at all depths. Using data from a commercial multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) system, we implemented an iterative optimization for fluence correction based on a finite-element implementation of the delta-Eddington approximation to the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE). We demonstrate a linear relationship between the image intensity and absorption coefficients across multiple wavelengths and depths in phantoms. We also demonstrate improved feature visibility and spectral recovery at depth in phantoms and with in vivo measurements, suggesting our approach could in the future enable quantitative extraction of tissue absorption coefficients in biological tissue. \u00a9 1982-2012 IEEE.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Boosted tree classifier for in vivo identification of early cervical cancer using multispectral digital colposcopy", "abstract": "Background: Cervical cancer develops over several years; screening and early diagnosis have decreased the incidence and mortality threefold over the last fifty years.

Herein, we for the first time present a two-dimensional (2D)-nanoplatform based on Cu2MnS2 nanoplates (NPs) for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) dual-modal imaging-guided photothermal therapy (PTT) of cancer in the NIR-II window. Methods: Cu2MnS2 NPs were synthesized through a facile and environmentally friendly process. A series of experiments, including the characterization of Cu2MnS2 NPs, the long-term toxicity of Cu2MnS2 NPs in BALB/c nude mice, the applications of Cu2MnS2 NPs for in vitro and in vivo MRI/MSOT dual-modal imaging and NIR-II PTT of cancer were carried out. Results: The as-synthesized Cu2MnS2 NPs exhibit low cytotoxicity, excellent biocompatibility as well as high photothermal conversion efficiency (~49.38%) and outstanding photostability. Together with their good T1-shortening effect and strong absorbance in the NIR-I and NIR-II region, the Cu2MnS2 NPs display high-contrast imaging performance both in MRI and MSOT (900 nm laser source). Moreover, the subsequent in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that the Cu2MnS2 NPs possess excellent PTT efficacy under 1064 nm laser irradiation with a low power density (0.6 W cm-2).

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) combines spectrophotometry and imaging, using advanced optics and algorithms to capture a spectrum from 400 to 1000 nm at each pixel in an enhanced dark-field microscopic (EDFM) image. HSI-EDFM can be used to confirm the identity of the materials of interest in a sample and generate an image \"mapping\" their presence and location in a sample. Hyperspectral mapping is particularly important for biological samples, where ENM morphology is visually indistinct from surrounding tissue structures. While use of HSI (without mapping) is increasing, no studies to date have compared results from hyperspectral mapping with conventional methods. Thus, the objective of this study was to utilize EDFM-HSI to locate, identify, and map metal oxide ENMs in ex vivo histological porcine skin tissues, a toxicological model of cutaneous exposure, and compare findings with those of Raman spectroscopy (RS), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

Perforators were marked and imaged with a novel system for quantitatively measuring tissue oxygenation, the Digital Light Hyperspectral Imager. Images were then analyzed to determine if perforator selection influenced ipsilateral flap perfusion. Flaps based on a single lateral row perforator (SLRP) were found to have a higher level of hemoglobin oxygenation in Zone I (mean %HbO2 = 76.1) compared to single medial row perforator (SMRP) flaps (%HbO2 = 71.6). Perfusion of Zone III relative to Zone I was similar between SLRP and SMRP flaps (97.4% vs. 97.9%, respectively). These differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05).

Based on the absorption of IR radiation by vibrational transitions in covalent bonds, the FTIR spectroscopic imaging technique offers the major advantage of the acquisition of local molecular expression profiles, while maintaining the topographic integrity of the tissue by avoiding time-consuming extraction, purification and separation steps. In the present study, it is demonstrated that FTIR spectroscopy enables the distinction of various plant species and FTIR spectroscopic imaging combined with chemometric data analysis enables one to gain a more distinct picture concerning morphology and distribution of active ingredients. In addition, initial evaluations of a three-dimensional distribution of ingredients of various plant roots are shown. \u00a9 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "In vivo multispectral imaging of the absorption and scattering properties of exposed brain using a digital red\u2013green\u2013blue camera", "abstract": "To evaluate multi-spectral images of the absorption and scattering properties in the cerebral cortex of rat brain, we investigated spectral reflectance images estimated by the Wiener estimation method using a digital red\u2013green\u2013blue camera.

Current techniques are often complicated by tumor heterogeneity. Herein, a novel in vivo approach that combines 19F magnetic resonance imaging (19F-MRI) R1 mapping with diffusionbased multispectral (MS) analysis is introduced. This approach restricts the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) measurements to viable tumor, the tissue of therapeutic interest. The technique exhibited sufficient sensitivity to detect a breathing gas challenge in a xenograft tumor model, and the hypoxic region measured by MS 19F-MRI was strongly correlated with histologic estimates of hypoxia. This approach was then applied to address the effects of antivascular agents on tumor oxygenation, which is a research question that is still under debate. The technique was used to monitor longitudinal pO2 changes in response to an antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (B20.4.1.1) and a selective dual phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (GDC-0980). GDC-0980 reduced viable tumor pO2 during a 3-day treatment period, and a significant reduction was also produced by B20.4.1.1. Overall, this method provides an unprecedented view of viable tumor pO2 and contributes to a greater understanding of the effects of antivascular therapies on the tumor's microenvironment. \u00a9 2013 Neoplasia Press, Inc.

The technique utilizes the Wiener estimation method to deduce spectral reflectance images instantaneously from an RGB image. Using the resultant absorbance spectrum as a response variable and the extinction coefficients of melanin, oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin as predictor variables, multiple regression analysis provides regression coefficients. Concentrations of melanin and total blood are then determined from the regression coefficients using conversion vectors that are numerically deduced in advance by the Monte Carlo simulations for light transport in skin. Oxygen saturation is obtained directly from the regression coefficients. Experiments with a tissue-like agar gel phantom validated the method.

However, distinguishing and following cells over extended time periods remains difficult. Previous studies have demonstrated that Cre recombinase-mediated recombination can lead to combinatorial expression of spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins (RFP, YFP and CFP) in neighboring cells, creating a 'Brainbow' of colors. The random combination of fluorescent proteins provides a way to distinguish adjacent cells, visualize cellular interactions and perform lineage analyses. Here, we describe Zebrabow (Zebrafish Brainbow) tools for in vivo multicolor imaging in zebrafish. First, we show that the broadly expressed ubi:Zebrabow line provides diverse color profiles that can be optimized by modulating Cre activity. Second, we find that colors are inherited equally among daughter cells and remain stable throughout embryonic and larval stages. Third, we show that UAS:Zebrabow lines can be used in combination with Gal4 to generate broad or tissue-specific expression patterns and facilitate tracing of axonal processes. Fourth, we demonstrate that Zebrabow can be used for long-term lineage analysis. Using the cornea as a model system, we provide evidence that embryonic corneal epithelial clones are replaced by large, wedge-shaped clones formed by centripetal expansion of cells from the peripheral cornea.

However, mouse CSF drainage into lymphatics has not been thoroughly characterized. We aimed to image this using an in vivo approach that combined quantum dot fluorescent nanoparticles with hyperspectral imaging.Findings: Quantum dot 655 was injected into the CSF of the cisterna magna in seven mice and visualized by in vivo hyperspectral imaging at time points 20 and 40 min, 1, 2, and 6 h after injection. In controls (n = 4), quantum dots were applied directly onto intact dura mater covering the cisterna magna. After imaging, lymph nodes in the neck were harvested and processed post-mortem for histological analysis. After injection into the CSF, quantum dot signal was detected in vivo in submandibular lymph nodes of all mice studied as early as 20 min, but not in controls. Post-mortem gross and histological examination of lymph nodes confirmed in vivo observations.Conclusions: Non-invasive in vivo hyperspectral imaging is a useful tool to study CSF lymphatic drainage and is relevant to understanding this pathway in CNS disease models. \u00a9 2013 Mathieu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "In vivo skin chromophore mapping using a multimode imaging dermoscope (SkinSpec\u2122)", "abstract": "We introduce a multimode dermoscope (SkinSpect\u2122) we developed for early detection of melanoma by combining fluorescence, polarization and hyperspectral imaging.

Tumor hypoxia has been associated with a poor clinical outcome and plays a critical role in tumor radioresistance. Recent Advances: Two main types of hypoxia exist in the tumor microenvironment: chronic and cycling hypoxia. Chronic hypoxia results from the limited diffusion distance of oxygen, and cycling hypoxia primarily results from the variation in microvessel red blood cell flux and temporary disturbances in perfusion. Chronic hypoxia may cause either tumor progression or regressive effects depending on the tumor model. However, there is a general trend toward the development of a more aggressive phenotype after cycling hypoxia. With advanced hypoxia imaging techniques, spatiotemporal characteristics of tumor hypoxia and the changes to the tumor microenvironment can be analyzed. Critical Issues: In this review, we focus on the biological and clinical consequences of chronic and cycling hypoxia on radiation treatment. We also discuss the advanced non-invasive imaging techniques that have been developed to detect and monitor tumor hypoxia in preclinical and clinical studies. Future Directions: A better understanding of the mechanisms of tumor hypoxia with non-invasive imaging will provide a basis for improved radiation therapeutic practices. Antioxid.

Cell-based therapies are highly promising strategies for GLD. In this study, G-Olig2 mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were induced into oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and were implanted into the brains of twitcher mice, an animal model of GLD, to explore the therapeutic potential of the cells. Methods: The G-Olig2 ESCs were induced into OPCs by using cytokines and a multi-step differentiation procedure. Oligodendrocyte markers were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunocytochemistry. The toxicity of psychosine to OPCs was determined by a cell proliferation assay kit. The GALC level of OPCs was also examined. OPCs were labeled with Dir and transplanted into the brains of twitcher mice. The transplanted cells were detected by in-Vivo Multispectral Imaging System and real-time PCR.

Results: Oligodendrocyte markers were expressed in OPCs, and 76%\u2208\u00b1\u22085.76% of the OPCs were enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-positive, eGFP was driven by the Olig2 promoter.

The GALC level of OPCs was 10.0\u2208\u00b1\u22081.23 nmol/hour per mg protein, which was significantly higher than other cells. Dir-labeled OPCs were injected into the forebrain of post-natal day 10 twitcher mice. The transplanted OPCs were myelin basic protein (MBP)-positive and remained along the injection tract as observed by fluorescent microscopy. The level of the Dir fluorescent signal and eGFP mRNA significantly decreased at days 10 and 20 after injection, as indicated by in-Vivo Multispectral Imaging System and real-time PCR. Because of poor cell survival and limited migration ability, there was no significant improvement in brain GALC activity, MBP level, life span, body weight, and behavioral deficits of twitcher mice. Conclusions: ESC-derived OPC transplantation was not sufficient to reverse the clinical course of GLD in twitcher mice. \u00a9 2015 Kuai et al.; licensee BioMed Central.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Quantifying nanoparticle transport in vivo using hyperspectral imaging with a dorsal skinfold window chamber", "abstract": "We have developed a noninvasive imaging method to quantify in vivo drug delivery pharmaco-kinetics without the need for blood or tissue collection to determine drug concentration.

The mutations cause undersulfation of glycosaminoglycans in cartilage. Studies of dtd mice with a knock-in Slc26a2 mutation showed an unusual progression of the disorder: net undersulfation is mild and normalizing with age, but the articular cartilage degrades with age and bones develop abnormally. To understand underlying mechanisms, we studied newborn dtd mice. We developed, verified and used high-definition infrared hyperspectral imaging of cartilage sections at physiological conditions, to quantify collagen and its orientation, noncollagenous proteins, and chondroitin chains, and their sulfation with 6-\u03bcm spatial resolution and without labeling.Wefound that chondroitin sulfation across the proximal femur cartilage varied dramatically in dtd, but not in the wild type. Corresponding undersulfation of dtd was mild in most regions, but strong in narrow articular and growth plate regions crucial for bone development. This undersulfation correlated with the chondroitin synthesis rate measured via radioactive sulfate incorporation, explaining the sulfation normalization with age. Collagen orientation was reduced, and the reduction correlated with chondroitin undersulfation. Such disorientation involved the layer of collagen covering the articular surface and protecting cartilage from degradation. Malformation of this layer may contribute to the degradation progression with age and to collagen and proteoglycan depletion from the articular region, which we observed in mice already at birth. The results provide clues to in vivo sulfation, DTD treatment, and cartilage growth. \u00a9 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Diagnosis of uterine cervix cancer using M\u00fcller polarimetry: A comparison with histopathology", "abstract": "Today around 275000 women a year in the world keep dying from the cancer of uterine cervix due to the difficulty to meet the logistic requirements of an organized screening in the developing world.

While spectroscopic imaging modalities such as fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) and multispectral imaging are clearly desirable to correlate biochemical information with morphology and facilitate direct comparisons with histopathology, the amount of useful spectroscopic information available can be limited by the finite numbers of detected photons associated with clinically practical data acquisition times and by difficulties associated with engineering appropriately compact and sterilizable clinical endoscopes. Fiber-optic-based probes delivering single-point measurements of autofluorescence can be made much more compact and at lower cost compared to imaging instruments and are simpler to engineer. They also provide more opportunities for more sophisticated multidimensional analysis of autofluorescence signals because all the detected photons contribute to a single (spatial) detection channel and measurement times of a few seconds, which are practical for in vivo applications and can provide sufficient photons to permit, for example, spectrally resolved analysis of multiexponential fluorescence decay profiles.

There is evident coupling between increases in neuronal activity and increases in local blood flow; however, many aspects of this neurovascular coupling remain unexplained by current models. Based on the rapid dilation of distant pial arteries during cortical functional hyperemia, we hypothesized that endothelial signaling may play a key role in the long-range propagation of vasodilation during functional hyperemia in the brain. Although well characterized in the peripheral vasculature, endothelial involvement in functional neurovascular coupling has not been demonstrated. Methods and Results-We combined in vivo exposed-cortex multispectral optical intrinsic signal imaging (MS-OISI) with a novel in vivo implementation of the light-dye technique to record the cortical hemodynamic response to somatosensory stimulus in rats before and after spatially selective endothelial disruption. We demonstrate that discrete interruption of endothelial signaling halts propagation of stimulus-evoked vasodilation in pial arteries, and that wide-field endothelial disruption in pial arteries significantly attenuates the hemodynamic response to stimulus, particularly the early, rapid increase and peak in hyperemia. Conclusions-Involvement of endothelial pathways in functional neurovascular coupling provides new explanations for the spatial and temporal features of the hemodynamic response to stimulus and could explain previous results that were interpreted as evidence for astrocyte-mediated control of functional hyperemia.

To acquire information on this cell-matrix interaction, we developed a technique for colocalized, correlative multispectral tissue analysis by implementing high-sensitivity, wide-field fluorescence imaging on a confocal Raman microscope. As a proof of principle, we study early stages of bone formation in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae because the zebrafish has emerged as a model organism to study vertebrate development. The newly formed bones were stained using a calcium fluorescent marker and the maturation process was imaged and chemically characterized in vivo. Results obtained from early stages of mineral deposition in the zebrafish fin bone unequivocally show the presence of hydrogen phosphate containing mineral phases in addition to the carbonated apatite mineral. The approach developed here opens significant opportunities in molecular imaging of metabolic activities, intracellular sensing, and trafficking as well as in vivo exploration of cell-tissue interfaces under (patho-)physiological conditions. \u00a9 2014 The Authors.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Handheld diffuse reflectance spectral imaging (DRSi) for in-vivo characterization of skin", "abstract": "Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy provides a noninvasive means to measure optical and physiological properties of tissues.

Background: Near-infrared approaches to imaging cardiovascular disease enable visualization of disease-associated biological processes in vivo. However, even at the scale of small animals, the strong scattering of light prevents high resolution imaging after the first 1-2. mm of tissue, leading to degraded signal localization. Methods: Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) was used to non-invasively image myocardial infarction (MI) in a murine model of coronary artery ligation at resolutions not possible with current deep-tissue optical imaging methods. Post-MI imaging was based on resolving the spectral absorption signature of a dendritic polyglycerol sulfate-based (dPGS) near-infrared imaging agent targeted to P- and L-selectin. Results: In vivo imaging succeeded in detection of the agent in the injured myocardium after intravenous injection. The high anatomic resolution (<200. \u03bcm) achieved by the described method allowed signals originating in the infarcted heart to be distinguished from uptake in adjacent regions. Histological analysis found dPGS signal in infarcted areas, originating from leukocytes and endothelial cells. Conclusions: MSOT imaging of myocardial infarction provides non-invasive visualization of optical contrast with a high spatial resolution that is not degraded by the scattering of light. \u00a9 2012 Elsevier GmbH.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Development of a non-invasive LED based device for adipose tissue thickness measurements in vivo", "abstract": "There are a number of techniques for body composition assessment in clinics and in field-surveys, but in all cases the applied methods have advantages and disadvantages.

Therefore, the development of a safe, mobile, non-invasive, optical method that would be easy to perform, precise and low-cost, but also would offer an accurate assessment of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) both in lean and in obese persons is required.

The probe contained multiple LEDs (660nm) distributed at various distances from the photo-detector which allow different light penetration depths into the subcutaneous tissue. The differences of the reflected light intensities were used to create a non-linear model, and the computed values were compared with the corresponding thicknesses of SAT, assessed by B-mode ultrasonography. The results show that with the optical system used in this study, accurate results of different SAT thicknesses can be obtained, and imply a further potential for development of multispectral optical system to observe changes of SAT thickness as well as to determine the percentage of total body fat. \u00a9 2012 SPIE.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Diagnosis of uterine cervix cancer using Muller polarimetry: A comparison with histopathology", "abstract": "Today around 275000 women a year in the world keep dying from the cancer of uterine cervix due to the difficulty to meet the logistic requirements of an organized screening in the developing world.

However, a key obstacle to cell therapy's success is the loss of engrafted cells due to apoptosis or necrosis in the ischemic myocardium. While many strategies have been developed to improve engrafted cell survival, tools to evaluate cell efficacy within the body are limited. Traditional genetic labeling tools, such as GFP-like fluorescent proteins (eGFP, DsRed, mCherry), have limited penetration depths in vivo due to tissue scattering and absorption. To circumvent these limitations, a near-infrared fluorescent mutant of the DrBphP bacteriophytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans, IFP1.4, was developed for in vivo imaging, but it has yet to be used for in vivo stem/progenitor cell tracking. In this study, we incorporated IFP1.4 into mouse cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) by a lentiviral vector. Live IFP1.4-labeled CPCs were imaged by their near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) using an Odyssey scanner following overnight incubation with biliverdin. A significant linear correlation was observed between the amount of cells and NIRF signal intensity in in vitro studies. Lentiviral mediated IFP1.4 gene labeling is stable, and does not impact the apoptosis and cardiac differentiation of CPC. To assess efficacy of our model for engrafted cells in vivo, IFP1.4-labeled CPCs were intramyocardially injected into infarcted hearts. NIRF signals were collected at 1-day, 7-days, and 14-days postinjection using the Kodak in vivo multispectral imaging system. Strong NIRF signals from engrafted cells were imaged 1 day after injection. At 1 week after injection, 70% of the NIRF signal was lost when compared to the intensity of the day 1 signal. The data collected 2 weeks following transplantation showed an 88% decrease when compared to day 1. Our studies have shown that IFP1.4 gene labeling can be used to track the viability of transplanted cells in vivo.

The murine dorsal skinfold window chamber model has been used for the study of both tumor microvasculature and other vascular diseases, including the study of anti-angiogenic agents in cancer therapy. Hyperspectral imaging of oxygen status of the microvasculature has not been widely used to evaluate response to inhibition of angiogenesis in early tumor cell induced vascular development. This study demonstrates the use of two different classes of anti-angiogenic agents, one targeting the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) pathway involved with vessel sprouting and the other targeting the Angiopoietin/Tie2 pathway involved in vascular destabilization. Studies evaluated the tumor microvascular response to anti-angiogenic inhibitors in the highly angiogenic renal cell carcinoma induced angiogenesis model. Methods. Human renal cell carcinoma, Caki-2 cells, were implanted in the murine skinfold window chamber. Mice were treated with either VEGF pathway targeted small molecule inhibitor Sunitinib (100 mg/kg) or with an anti-Ang-2 monoclonal antibody (10 mg/kg) beginning the day of window chamber surgery and tumor cell implantation. Hyperspectral imaging of hemoglobin saturation was used to evaluate both the development and oxygenation of the tumor microvasculature. Tumor volume over time was also assessed over an 11-day period post surgery. Results: The window chamber model was useful to demonstrate the inhibition of angiogenesis using the VEGF pathway targeted agent Sunitinib. Results show impairment of tumor microvascular development, reduced oxygenation of tumor-associated vasculature and impairment of tumor volume growth compared to control. On the other hand, this model failed to demonstrate the anti-angiogenic effect of the Ang-2 targeted agent. Follow up experiments suggest that the initial surgery of the window chamber model may interfere with such an agent thus skewing the actual effects on angiogenesis. Conclusions: Results show that this model has great potential to evaluate anti-VEGF, or comparable, targeted agents; however the mere protocol of the window chamber model interferes with proper evaluation of Ang-2 targeted agents. The limitations of this in vivo model in evaluating the response of tumor vasculature to anti-angiogenic agents are discussed. \u00a9 2014 Biel et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Optical Diagnostics and Sensing XIV: Toward Point-of-Care Diagnostics", "abstract": "The proceedings contain 30 papers.

Five young healthy female students participated in the study; the measurements were performed on three body sites: calf, upper and lower abdomen. The backscattered light acquired with the prototype was compared to SAT measured with high resolution ultrasound imaging. The coefficient of variation indicated high reliability of the measurements. Statistically significant (from r=0.81 to r=0.95; p<0.05) correlation between intensity of backscattered light and SAT thicknesses for all four wavelength was observed, especially at source-detector distance 25mm.

We evaluate the use of multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) to detect upregulated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor in orthotopic pancreatic xenografts using a near-infrared EGF-conjugated CF-750 fluorescent probe. MSOT is based on the photoacoustic effect and thus not limited by photon scattering, resulting in high-resolution tomographic images. Pancreatic tumor-bearing mice with luciferase-transduced S2VP10L tumors were intravenously injected with EGF-750 probe before MSOT imaging. We characterized probe specificity and bioactivity via immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometric analysis. In vitro data along with optical bioluminescence/fluorescence imaging were used to validate acquired MSOT in vivo images of probe biodistribution. Indocyanine green dye was used as a nonspecific control to define specificity of EGF-probe accumulation. Maximum accumulation occurred at 6 hours postinjection, demonstrating specific intratumoral probe uptake and minimal liver and kidney off-target accumulation. Optical bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging confirmed tumor-specific probe accumulation consistent with MSOT images.

Although trastuzumab reduces production of the angiogenic factor VEGF in HER2 + tumors, the acute and sustained effects of trastuzumab on the tumor vasculature are not understood fully, particularly in trastuzumab-resistant tumors. We used mouse models of trastuzumab sensitive and trastuzumab-resistant HER2 + breast cancers to measure dynamic changes in tumor microvessel density and hemoglobin oxygenation (sO2) in vivo using quantitative hyperspectral imaging at 2, 5, 9, and 14 days after antibody treatment. Further analysis quantified the distribution of microvessels into low and high oxygenation groups, and monitored changes in these distributions with trastuzumab treatment. Gold standard immunohistochemistry was performed to validate complementary markers of tumor cell and vascular response to treatment. Trastuzumab treatment in both responsive and resistant tumors resulted in decreased sO2 5 days after initial treatment when compared to IgG-treated controls (p<0.05). Importantly, responsive tumors showed significantly higher vessel density and significantly lower sO2 than all other groups at 5 days post-treatment (p<0.05). Distribution analysis of vessel sO2 showed a significant (p<0.05) shift of highly oxygenated vessels towards lower oxygenation over the time-course in both trastuzumab-treated responsive and resistant tumors. This study suggests that longitudinal hyperspectral imaging of microvessel sO2 and density could distinguish trastuzumab responsive from trastuzumab-resistant tumors, a finding that could be exploited in the post-neoadjuvant setting to guide post-surgical treatment decisions. \u00a9 2014 Optical Society of America.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Longitudinal in vivo imaging to assess blood flow and oxygenation in implantable engineered tissues", "abstract": "The functionality of vascular networks within implanted prevascularized tissues is difficult to assess using traditional analysis techniques, such as histology. This is largely due to the inability to visualize hemodynamics in a longitudinal fashion. To address this limitation, we developed dynamic imaging methods to measure blood flow and hemoglobin oxygen saturation in implanted prevascularized tissues noninvasively and longitudinally. Using laser speckle imaging, multispectral imaging, and intravital microscopy, we demonstrate that fibrin-based tissue implants anastomose with the host (severe combined immunodeficient mice) in as short as 20 h. Anastomosis results in initial perfusion with highly oxygenated blood, and an increase in average hemoglobin oxygenation of 53%. However, shear rates in the preformed vessels were low (20.8 \u00b1 12.8 s -1), and flow did not persist in the vast majority of preformed vessels due to thrombus formation. These findings suggest that designing an appropriate vascular network structure in prevascularized tissues to maintain shear rates above the threshold for thrombosis may be necessary to maintain flow following implantation. We conclude that wide-field and microscopic functional imaging together enables longitudinal assessment of hemodynamics in prevascularized tissues, and rapid evaluation and refinement of vascularization strategies used in tissue engineering. \u00a9 OSA 2012.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "New imaging technique using Degree of Polarization for the study of polarimetric properties for non-invasive biomedical diagnostic", "abstract": "This research proposes a new imaging technique for near real time multispectral acquisition using CCD RGB cameras of the so called \"Degree Of Polarization\" (DOP) in polarimetry for future clinical investigation.

Parameters that might be controlled or tuned to assess the performance of qPAI algorithms were studied: broadband acoustic properties, multiwavelength optical properties with added absorbers and scatterers, and photoacoustic efficiency. The optical and acoustic properties of PVCP can be tuned to be broadly representative of soft tissue. The Gr\u00fcneisen parameter is larger than expected in tissue, which is an advantage as it increases the signal-to-noise ratio of the photoacoustic measurements. Interestingly, when the absorption was altered by adding absorbers, the absorption spectra measured using high peak power nanosecond-pulsed sources (typical in photoacoustics) were repeatably diffierent from the ones measured using the low power source in the spectrophotometer, indicative of photochemical reactions taking place.CCC. \u00a9 2015 SPIE-OSA.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "In vivo metabolic fingerprinting of neutral lipids with hyperspectral stimulated raman scattering microscopy", "abstract": "Metabolic fingerprinting provides valuable information on the physiopathological states of cells and tissues.

Recent work has suggested that this approach may be extended to allow surgical attachment of larger tissue segments for applications such as bowel anastomosis. In a large series of porcine surgical procedures bipolar RF energy was used to resect and re-seal the small bowel in vivo with a commercial tissue fusion device (Ligasure; Covidien PLC, USA). The tissue was then imaged with a multispectral imaging laparoscope to obtain a spectral datacube comprising both fused and healthy tissue. Maps of blood volume, oxygen saturation and scattering power were derived from the measured reflectance spectra using an optimised lighttissue interaction model. A 60% increase in reflectance of visible light (460-700 nm) was observed after fusion, with the tissue taking on a white appearance. Despite this the distinctive shape of the haemoglobin absorption spectrum was still noticeable in the 460- 600 nm wavelength range. Scattering power increased in the fused region in comparison to normal serosa, while blood volume and oxygen saturation decreased. Observed fusion-induced changes in the reflectance spectrum are consistent with the biophysical changes induced through tissue denaturation and increased collagen cross-linking. The multispectral imager allows mapping of the spatial extent of these changes and classification of the zone of damaged tissue. Further analysis of the spectral data in parallel with histopathological examination of excised specimens will allow correlation of the optical property changes with microscopic alterations in tissue structure. \u00a9 2015 SPIE-OSA.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Enhanced antitumor efficacy by d -glucosamine-functionalized and paclitaxel-loaded poly(ethylene glycol)-co-poly(trimethylene carbonate) polymer nanoparticles", "abstract": "The poor selectivity of chemotherapeutics for cancer treatment may lead to dose-limiting side effects that compromise clinical outcomes.

In certain procedures, where nerves show visual resemblance to surrounding adipose tissue, this can be particularly challenging for the human eye. An example of such a delicate procedure is thyroid and parathyroid surgery, where iatrogenic injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve can result in transient or permanent vocal problems (0.5-2.0% reported incidence). A camera system, enabling nerve-specific image enhancement, would be useful in preventing such complications. This might be realized with hyperspectral camera technology using silicon (Si) or indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) sensor chips. Methods As a first step towards such a camera, we evaluated the performance of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy by analysing spectra collected during 18 thyroid and parathyroid resections. We assessed the contrast information present in two different spectral ranges, for respectively Si and InGaAs sensors. Two hundred fifty three in vivo, wide-band diffuse reflectance spectra (350-1,830 nm range, 1 nm resolution) were acquired on 52 tissue spots, including nerve (n = 22), muscle (n = 12), and adipose tissue (n = 18). We extracted 36 features from these spectroscopic data: 18 gradients and 18 amplitude differences at predefined points in the tissue spectra. Best distinctive feature combinations were established using binary logistic regression. Classification performance was evaluated in a cross-validation (CV) approach by leave-one-out (LOO). To generalize nerve recognition applicability, we performed a train-test (TT) validation using the thyroid and parathyroid surgery data for training purposes and carpal tunnel release surgery data (10 nerve spots and 5 adipose spots) for classification purposes. Results For combinations of two distinctive spectral features, LOO revealed an accuracy of respectively 78% for Si-sensors and 95% for InGaAs-sensors. TT revealed accuracies of respectively 67% and 100%. Conclusions Using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy we have identified that InGaAs sensors are better suited for automated discrimination between nerves and surrounding adipose tissue than Si sensors. \u00a9 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Light fluence correction for quantitative determination of tissue absorption coefficient using multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography", "abstract": "MultiSpectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) is a fast developing imaging modality, combining the high resolution and penetration depth of ultrasound with the excellent contrast from optical imaging of tissue. Absorption and scattering of the near infrared excitation light modulates the spectral profile of light as it propagates deep into biological tissue, meaning the images obtained provide only qualitative insight into the distribution of tissue chromophores. The goal of this work is to accurately recover the spectral profile of excitation light by modelling light fluence in the data reconstruction, to enable quantitative imaging. We worked with a commercial small animal MSOT scanner and developed our light fluence correction for its' cylindrical geometry. Optoacoustic image reconstruction pinpoints the sources of acoustic waves detected by the transducers and returns the initial pressure amplitude at these points. This pressure is the product of the dimensionless Gr\u00fcneisen parameter, the absorption coefficient and the light fluence. Under the condition of constant Gr\u00fcneisen parameter and well modelled light fluence, there is a linear relationship between the initial pressure amplitude measured in the optoacoustic image and the absorption coefficient. We were able to reproduce this linear relationship in different physical regions of an agarose gel phantom containing targets of known optical absorption coefficient, demonstrating that our light fluence model was working. We also demonstrate promising results of light fluence correction effects on in vivo data. \u00a9 2015 SPIE.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Multi-spectral scanning fiber endoscope with concurrent autofluorescence mitigation for enhanced target-to-background ratio imaging", "abstract": "We developed a multispectral fluorescence-reflectance scanning fiber endoscope (SFE) for wide-field molecular imaging of fluorescence-labeled molecular probes.

Sickle red blood cells (SSRBCs) have shown an ability to target such hypoxic niches and induce tumoricidal effects when used together with exogenous pro-oxidants. Here we determine whether the delivery of a model therapeutic encapsulated in murine SSRBCs can be enhanced by ex vivo photo sensitization under conditions that delay autohemolysis to a time that coincides with maximal localization of SSRBCs in a hypoxic tumor. Hyperspectral imaging of 4T1 carcinomas shows oxygen saturation levels <10% in a large fraction (commonly 50% or more) of the tumor. Using video microscopy of dorsal skin window chambers implanted with 4T1 tumors, we demonstrate that allogeneic SSRBCs, but not normal RBCs (nRBCs), selectively accumulate in hypoxic 4T1 tumors between 12 and 24 h after systemic administration. We further show that ex vivo photo-oxidation can program SSRBCs to postpone hemolysis/release of a model therapeutic to a point that coincides with their maximum sequestration in hypoxic tumor microvessels. Under these conditions, drug-loaded photosensitized SSRBCs show a 3-4 fold greater drug delivery to tumors compared to non-photosensitized SSRBCs, drug-loaded photosensitized nRBCs, and free drug. These results demonstrate that photo-oxidized SSRBCs, but not photo-oxidized nRBCs, sequester and hemolyze in hypoxic tumors and release substantially more drug than photo-oxidized nRBCs and non-photo-oxidized SSRBCs. Photo-oxidation of drug-loaded SSRBCs thus appears to exploit the unique tumor targeting and carrier properties of SSRBCs to optimize drug delivery to hypoxic tumors. Such programmed and drug-loaded SSRBCs therefore represent a novel and useful tool for augmenting drug delivery to hypoxic solid tumors. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy can provide quantitative biochemical and morphological information for tissue characterization. The diffuse reflectance data is influenced by the functional state of matter, which affects the optical properties. White light is used to measure these changes in optical properties which in turn give an idea about the region under scan. Optical imaging has been gaining importance especially in medical field. An optical fibre spectrometer is set up to obtain the reflectance data. Reflectance probe is mounted on a movable mechanism with two degrees of freedom which is controlled by a Programmable Logic Control (PLC) unit. PLC unit contains Human-Machine interface (HMI) to feed in manually the dimension of the area to be scanned, scan speed (thereby resolution) with which scanner arm is to be moved. This automation could avoid overlapping of data during scanning. Codes are written in MATLAB to display the direct reflected intensity images, functional images and multispectral images. The reflected intensity images give the structural details of the region under scan. The functional imaging enables to measure the physiological changes (change in molar concentrations of oxy-hemoglobin, deoxy-hemoglobin and oxygenation state) in tissue under diseased conditions. The multispectral imaging helps to visualize the changes in the optical properties of tissues at any particular wavelength underneath the region of scan in turn, aiding in disease diagnosis. The unique information obtained from the diffuse reflectance spectroscopy makes it suitable for a variety of clinical applications.

A complete removal of malignant tissue and conservation of healthy tissue is important for the preservation of organ function, patient satisfaction, and quality of life. Visual inspection and palpation is not sufficient for discriminating between malignant and normal tissue types. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology has the potential to noninvasively delineate surgical tumor margin and can be used as an intra-operative visual aid tool. Since histological images provide the ground truth of cancer margins, it is necessary to warp the cancer regions in ex vivo histological images back to in vivo hyperspectral images in order to validate the tumor margins detected by HSI and to optimize the imaging parameters. In this paper, principal component analysis (PCA) is utilized to extract the principle component bands of the HSI images, which is then used to register HSI images with the corresponding histological image. Affine registration is chosen to model the global transformation. A B-spline free form deformation (FFD) method is used to model the local non-rigid deformation.

This yeast interacts closely with innate immune cells, leading to various fates, including fungal persistence within cells, making possible the dissemination of the yeast cells with monocytes via a Trojan horse strategy. In humans, the natural history of the infection begins with primoinfection during childhood, which is followed by dormancy and, in some individuals, reactivation upon immunosuppression. To address the question of dormancy, we studied C. neoformans infection at the macrophage level (in vitro H99- macrophage interaction) and at the organ level in a murine model of cryptococcosis. We analyzed the diversity of yeast adaptation to the host by characterizing several C. neoformans populations with new assays based on flow cytometry (quantitative flow cytometry, multispectral imaging flow cytometry, sorting), microscopy (dynamic imaging), and gene expression analysis. On the basis of parameters of multiplication and stress response, various populations of yeast cells were observed over time in vivo and in vitro. Cell sorting allowed the identification of a subpopulation that was less prone to grow under standard conditions than the other populations, with growth enhanced by the addition of serum. Gene expression analysis revealed that this population had specific metabolic characteristics that could reflect dormancy. Our data suggest that dormant yeast cells could exist in vitro and in vivo. C. neoformans exhibits a huge plasticity and adaptation to hosts that deserves further study. In vitro generation of dormant cells is now the main challenge to overcome the limited number of yeast cells recovered in our models. IMPORTANCE Cryptococcus neoformans is a sugar-coated unicellular fungus that interacts closely with various cells and organisms, including amoebas, nematodes, and immune cells of mammals. This yeast is able to proliferate and survive in the intracellular environment. C. neoformans causes cryptococcosis, and yeast dormancy in humans has been suggested on the basis of epidemiological evidence obtained years ago. By studying an in vitro model of yeast-macrophage interaction and murine models of cryptococcosis, we observed that yeast cells evolve in heterogeneous populations during infection on the basis of global metabolic activity. We compared the growth ability and gene expression of yeast cells belonging to various populations in those two models. We eventually found a population of yeast cells with low metabolism that fit some of the criteria for dormant cells. This paves the way for further characterization of dormancy in C. neoformans. \u00a9 2015 Alanio et al.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Infrared hyperspectral imaging for enhanced tissue visualization and discrimination during surgical operation", "abstract": "A new hyperspectral imaging system has been designed in infrared 950 nm-1700 nm spectral range to be integrated in operating rooms in order to detect some vital and anatomical tissues, hardly noticeable by the surgeon's naked eye during surgical interventions.

Well-defined, versatile and stable phantom materials are essential to assess the accuracy, robustness and applicability of multispectral Quantitative Photoacoustic Imaging (qPAI) algorithms in experimental scenarios. This study assesses the potential of polyvinyl chloride plastisol (PVCP) as a phantom material for qPAI, building on previous work that focused on using PVCP for quality control. Parameters that might be controlled or tuned to assess the performance of qPAI algorithms were studied: broadband acoustic properties, multiwavelength optical properties with added absorbers and scatterers, and photoacoustic efficiency. The optical and acoustic properties of PVCP can be tuned to be broadly representative of soft tissue. The Gr\u00fcneisen parameter is larger than expected in tissue, which is an advantage as it increases the signal-to-noise ratio of the photoacoustic measurements. Interestingly, when the absorption was altered by adding absorbers, the absorption spectra measured using high peak power nanosecond-pulsed sources (typical in photoacoustics) were repeatably different from the ones measured using the low power source in the spectrophotometer, indicative of photochemical reactions taking place. \u00a9 2015 SPIE.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor: A pivotal mediator of anti-inflammatory responses in acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure", "abstract": "Acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure (AALF) is characterized both by activation of innate immune responses and susceptibility to sepsis. Circulating monocytes and hepatic macrophages are central mediators of inflammatory responses and tissue repair processes during human AALF. Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) modulates monocyte/macrophage function through inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling. The aims of this study were to establish the role of SLPI in AALF. Circulating levels of SLPI, monocyte cluster of differentiation 163 (CD163), human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated levels of NF-\u03baBp65, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin (IL)-6 were determined in patients with AALF, chronic liver disease, and healthy controls. Immunohistochemistry and multispectral imaging of AALF explant tissue determined the cellular sources of SLPI and hepatic macrophage phenotype. The phenotype and function of monocytes and macrophages was determined following culture with recombinant human (rh)-SLPI, liver homogenates, and plasma derived from AALF patients in the presence and absence of antihuman (\u03b1)SLPI. Hepatic and circulatory concentrations of SLPI were elevated in AALF and immunohistochemistry revealed SLPI expression in biliary epithelial cells and within hepatic macrophages (h-m\u03c8) in areas of necrosis. H-m\u03c8 and circulating monocytes in AALF exhibited an anti-inflammatory phenotype and functional characteristics; typified by reductions in NF-\u03baBp65, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 and preserved IL-10 secretion following LPS challenge.

Multispectral photoacoustic imaging was performed on surgically excised thyroid tissue, and chromophore images that represented optical absorption of deoxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, lipid, and water were reconstructed. After the imaging procedure, the pathologist marked malignant tissue, benign nodules, and normal regions on histopathologic slides, and digital images of the marked histopathologic slides were obtained. The histopathologic images were coregistered with chromophore images. Areas corresponding to malignant tissue, benign nodules, and normal tissue were defined on the chromophore images. Pixel values within each area were averaged to determine the mean intensities of deoxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, lipid, and water. RESULTS. There was a statistically significant difference between malignant and benign nodules with respect to mean intensity of deoxyhemoglobin (p = 0.014). There was a difference between malignant and normal tissue in mean intensity of deoxyhemoglobin (p = 0.003), lipid (p = 0.001), and water (p < 0.0001). A difference between benign nodules and normal tissue was found in mean intensity of oxyhemoglobin (p < 0.0001), lipid (p < 0.0001), and water (p < 0.0001).

Controls were exposed to dispersion medium devoid of NPs. TiO2NPs were characterized for size, surface area, chemical impurities, and agglomeration state in the exposure medium. Pulmonary transcriptional profiles were generated using microarrays from tissues collected one and 28 d postexposure. Property-specific pathway effects were identified. Pulmonary protein levels of specific inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were confirmed by ELISA. The data were collapsed to 659 differentially expressed genes (P \u2264 0.05; fold change \u2265 1.5). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of these genes revealed that TiO2NPs clustered mainly by postexposure timepoint followed by particle type. A pathway-based meta-analysis showed that the combination of smaller size, large deposited surface area, and surface amidation contributes to TiO2NP gene expression response. Embedding of TiO2NP in paint dampens the overall transcriptional effects. The magnitude of the expression changes associated with pulmonary inflammation differed across all particles; however, the underlying pathway perturbations leading to inflammation were similar, suggesting a generalized mechanism-of-action for all TiO2NPs.

Fortunately, the survival rate for early-diagnosed patients is relatively high. Therefore, in vivo imaging plays an important role for the detection and treatment of the disease. Accurate prostate cancer localization with noninvasive imaging can be used to guide biopsy, radiotherapy, and surgery as well as to monitor disease progression. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed with an endorectal coil provides higher prostate cancer localization accuracy, when compared to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). However, in general, a single type of MRI is not sufficient for reliable tumor localization. As an alternative, multispectral MRI, i.e., the use of multiple MRI-derived datasets, has emerged as a promising noninvasive imaging technique for the localization of prostate cancer; however, almost all studies are with human readers. There is a significant inter- and intra-observer variability for human readers, and it is substantially difficult for humans to analyze the large dataset of multispectral MRI. To solve these problems, this study presents an automated localization method. We first perform tests to see the best performing combination of multiparametric MRI, then develop localization methods using cost-sensitive support vector machines (SVMs), and show that this method results in improved localization accuracy than classical SVM. Additionally, we develop a new segmentation method by combining conditional random fields (CRF) with a cost-sensitive framework and show that our method further improves cost-sensitive SVM (C-SVM) results by incorporating spatial information. We test SVM, C-SVM, and the proposed cost-sensitive CRF on multispectral MRI datasets acquired from 21 biopsy-confirmed cancer patients.

Insufficient tumor vascularization limits particle transport and also results in avascular hypoxic regions with non-proliferating cells, which can regenerate tissue after nanoparticle-delivered cytotoxicity or thermal ablation. Nanoparticle surface modifications provide for increasing tumor targeting and uptake while decreasing immunogenicity and toxicity. Herein, we created novel two layer gold-nanoshell particles coated with alkanethiol and phosphatidylcholine, and three layer nanoshells additionally coated with high-density-lipoprotein. We hypothesize that these particles have enhanced penetration into 3-dimensional cell cultures modeling avascular tissue when compared to standard poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-coated nanoshells. Particle uptake and distribution in liver, lung, and pancreatic tumor cell cultures were evaluated using silver-enhancement staining and hyperspectral imaging with dark field microscopy.

The methods such as X-rays, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have played an important role in preoperative accurate diagnosis. However, most of them are inapplicable for intraoperative surgery. We have proposed a surgical navigation system based on optical molecular imaging technology for intraoperative detection of tumors and metastasis. This system collects images from two CCD cameras for real-time fluorescent and color imaging. For image processing, the template matching algorithm is used for multispectral image fusion. For the application of tumor detection, the mouse breast cancer cell line 4T1-luc, which shows highly metastasis, was used for tumor model establishment and a model of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expressing breast cancer. The tumor-bearing nude mice were given tail vein injection of MMP 750FAST (PerkinElmer, Inc. USA) probe and imaged with both bioluminescence and fluorescence to assess in vivo binding of the probe to the tumor and metastases sites. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed to confirm the presence of tumor and metastasis. As a result, one tumor can be observed visually in vivo. However liver metastasis has been detected under surgical navigation system and all were confirmed by histology.

However, existing single-spectral and multispectral methods are not very efficient and effective at reconstructing the distribution of the radionuclide tracer. In this paper, we present a semi-quantitative Cerenkov radiation spectral characteristic-based source reconstruction method named the hybrid spectral CLT, to efficiently reconstruct the radionuclide tracer with both encouraging reconstruction results and less acquisition and image reconstruction time. Methodology/Principal Findings: We constructed the implantation mouse model implanted with a 400 \u03bcCi Na131I radioactive source and the physiological mouse model received an intravenous tail injection of 400 \u03bcCi radiopharmaceutical Iodine-131 (I-131) to validate the performance of the hybrid spectral CLT and compared the reconstruction results, acquisition, and image reconstruction time with that of single-spectral and multispectral CLT. Furthermore, we performed 3D noninvasive monitoring of I-131 uptake in the thyroid and quantified I-131 uptake in vivo using hybrid spectral CLT. Results showed that the reconstruction based on the hybrid spectral CLT was more accurate in localization and quantification than using single-spectral CLT, and was more efficient in the in vivo experiment compared with multispectral CLT. Additionally, 3D visualization of longitudinal observations suggested that the reconstructed energy of I-131 uptake in the thyroid increased with acquisition time and there was a robust correlation between the reconstructed energy versus the gamma ray counts of I-131 (r2 = 0.8240). The ex vivo biodistribution experiment further confirmed the I-131 uptake in the thyroid for hybrid spectral CLT. Conclusions/Significance: Results indicated that hybrid spectral CLT could be potentially used for thyroid imaging to evaluate its function and monitor its treatment for thyroid cancer. \u00a9 2012 Hu et al.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Sensitivity analysis-based time gate selection procedure for biexponential fluorescence imaging", "abstract": "Fluorescence lifetime imaging is an essential analytical tool in studies of cells and tissues.

The pathologic \u03b1-helix \u2192 \u03b2-strand conversion of amyloid \u03b21-42 and amyloid \u03b21-40 peptides causes neuronal death in the vicinity. Symptomology often presents only after significant neurodegeneration. This thus warrants early detection of amyloidopathy in Alzheimers disease. Nonexistent modalities for direct identification and quantitation of soluble amyloid aggregates or (proto)fibrils forced us to undertake the development of a spectrophotometric technique to support ongoing drug design. Key requirements were independence from the need for extraneous staining, unambiguous amyloid aggregate detection, and minimal influence of interpretative errors. A Cytoviva instrument pivotal to this study captures scattering of light of visible-near-infrared (VNIR, 400-1000 nm) wavelengths within each pixel of the microscopic view field. We thus assembled a scattering intensity pattern database that provided \"signatures\" of amyloid aggregates. Comparison of unknown samples against this database enabled direct detection of amyloid aggregates. The technique was found useful for monitoring retinal and brain amyloidopathy in an ongoing preclinical anti-AD study, attesting to the techniques sensitivity and specificity. Interestingly, the technique was found applicable not just to excised brain tissue but also to isolated mouse retina.

Recent findings Recent advances in light sheet-based imaging techniques now offer the ability to live image the vascular system in whole organs or even in whole animals during development and in pathological conditions with a satisfactory spatial and temporal resolution. Conversely, super resolution microscopy now allows studying cellular processes at a near-molecular resolution.

Researchers now have well-developed tools to specifically examine the dynamic nature of vascular development during angiogenic sprouting, remodeling and regression as well as the vascular responses in disease situations in vivo. In addition, open questions in endothelial and lymphatic cell biology that require subcellular resolution such as actin dynamics, junctional complex formation and stability, vascular permeability and receptor trafficking can now be approached with high resolution.

Materials and Methods Altogether 52 clinical AKs in 12 patients were included in this study. In six patients digital photos were taken of the naive AKs, and again after methylaminolevulinate(MAL)-fluorescence diagnosis which was used to teach HIS to find subclinical lesions. After 2-3 days when the MAL had vanished, the hyperspectral images were taken. Biopsies were taken from clinical AKs, healthy-looking skin and several suspected subclinical AKs. In the other six patients digital and hyperspectral images were taken of the naive AKs followed by one biopsy per patient. Results HIS detected all clinically visible 52 AKs and numerous subclinical lesions. The histopathology of the 33 biopsied lesions were concordant with the HIS results showing either AK (n = 28) or photodamage (n = 5). Of the 28 histopathologically confirmed AKs, 16 were subclinical.

QDs were completely encapsulated by the vesicles. Nearly 80% encapsulation percentage was achieved for apomorphine. A greater fluorescence intensity was observed in mouse brains treated with liposomes compared to free QDs. This result was further confirmed by ex vivo imaging of the organs. QD uptake by the heart and liver was reduced by liposomal incorporation. Apomorphine accumulation in the brain increased by 2.4-fold after this incorporation. According to a hyperspectral imaging analysis, multifunctional liposomes but not the aqueous solution carried QDs into the brain. Liposomes were observed to have been efficiently endocytosed into bEND3 cells.

In this paper, it is assumed that the time-resolved fluorescence spectrum profiles of the constituent components are linearly independent and known a priori. For comparison purposes, the standard least squares (LS) solution and two constrained versions nonnegativity constrained least squares (NCLS) and fully constrained least squares (FCLS) (Heinz and Chang, 2001) are also tested. Their performance was evaluated by using synthetic simulations, as well as imaged samples from fluorescent dyes and ex vivo tissue. In all the synthetic evaluations, the CO obtained the best accuracy in the estimations of the proportional contributions. CO could achieve an improvement ranging between 41% and 59% in the relative error compared to LS, NCLS, and FCLS at different signal-to-noise ratios. A liquid mixture of fluorescent dyes was also prepared and imaged in order to provide a controlled scenario with real data, where CO and FCLS obtained the best performance. The CO and FCLS were also tested with 20 ex vivo samples of human coronary arteries, where the expected concentrations are qualitatively known. A certainty measure was employed to assess the confidence in the estimations made by each algorithm. The experiments confirmed a better performance of CO, since this method is optimal with respect to equality and inequality restrictions in the linear unmixing formulation. Thus, the evaluation showed that CO achieves an accurate characterization of the samples.

A separate section is devoted to the hybrid imaging techniques based on the optoacoustic phenomenon, such as multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), which are poised to leverage the traditional contrast and specificity advantages of optical spectrum by delivering an ever powerful set of capabilities, including real-time operation and high spatial resolution, not affected by the scattering nature of biological tissues. \u00a9 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Enhancing surgical vision by using real-time imaging of \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin targeted near-infrared fluorescent agent", "abstract": "Background: This study was designed to improve the surgical procedure and outcome of cancer surgery by means of real-time molecular imaging feedback of tumor spread and margin delineation using targeted near-infrared fluorescent probes with specificity to tumor biomarkers. Surgical excision of cancer often is confronted with difficulties in the identification of cancer spread and the accurate delineation of tumor margins. Currently, the assessment of tumor borders is afforded by postoperative pathology or, less reliably, intraoperative frozen sectioning. Fluorescence imaging is a natural modality for intraoperative use by directly relating to the surgeon's vision and offers highly attractive characteristics, such as high-resolution, sensitivity, and portability. Via the use of targeted probes it also becomes highly tumor-specific and can lead to significant improvements in surgical procedures and outcome. Methods: Mice bearing xenograft human tumors were injected with \u03b1v\u03b23-integrin receptor-targeted fluorescent probe and in vivo visualized by using a novel, real-time, multispectral fluorescence imaging system. Confirmatory ex vivo imaging, bioluminescence imaging, and histopathology were used to validate the in vivo findings. Results: Fluorescence images were all in good correspondence with the confirming bioluminescence images in respect to signal colocalization. Fluorescence imaging detected all tumors and successfully guided total tumor excision by effectively detecting small tumor residuals, which occasionally were missed by the surgeon. Tumor tissue exhibited target-to-background ratio of \u223c4.0, which was significantly higher compared with white-light images representing the visual contrast. Histopathology confirmed the capability of the method to identify tumor negative margins with high specificity and better prediction rate compared with visual inspection. Conclusions: Real-time multispectral fluorescence imaging using tumor specific molecular probes is a promising modality for tumor excision by offering real time feedback to the surgeon in the operating room. \u00a9 Society of Surgical Oncology 2011.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "DLP hyperspectral imaging for surgical and clinical utility", "abstract": "We describe a novel digital light processing, DLP hyperspectral imaging system for visualizing chemical composition of in vivo tissues during surgical procedures non-invasively and at near video rate.

Using acridine orange (1 milliMolar, 20 seconds) to stain nuclei, basal cell carcinomas were detected in fluorescence confocal mosaics of Mohs surgical excisions with sensitivity of 96.6% and specificity of 89.2%. A possible barrier toward clinical acceptance is that confocal mosaics are based on a single mode of contrast and appear in grayscale, whereas histology is based on two (hematoxylin for nuclei, eosin for cellular cytoplasm and dermis) and appears purple-and-pink. Toward addressing this barrier, we report progress in developing a multispectral analytical model for digital staining: fluorescence confocal mosaics, which show only nuclei, are digitally stained purple and overlaid on reflectance confocal mosaics, which show only cellular cytoplasm and dermis, and digitally stained pink, to mimic the appearance of histology. Comparison of digitally stained confocal mosaics by our Mohs surgeon to the corresponding Mohs histology shows good correlation for normal and tumor detail.

In particular, nano-scaled carriers have revolutionalized drug delivery, allowing for therapeutic agents to be selectively targeted on an organ, tissue and cell specific level, also minimizing exposure of healthy tissue to drugs. In this review we discuss and analyze three issues, which are considered to be at the core of nano-scaled drug delivery systems, namely functionalization of nanocarriers, delivery to target organs and in vivo imaging. The latest developments on highly specific conjugation strategies that are used to attach biomolecules to the surface of nanoparticles (NP) are first reviewed. Besides drug carrying capabilities, the functionalization of nanocarriers also facilitate their transport to primary target organs. We highlight the leading advantage of nanocarriers, i.e. their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a tightly packed layer of endothelial cells surrounding the brain that prevents high-molecular weight molecules from entering the brain. The BBB has several transport molecules such as growth factors, insulin and transferrin that can potentially increase the efficiency and kinetics of brain-targeting nanocarriers. Potential treatments for common neurological disorders, such as stroke, tumours and Alzheimer's, are therefore a much sought-after application of nanomedicine. Likewise any other drug delivery system, a number of parameters need to be registered once functionalized NPs are administered, for instance their efficiency in organ-selective targeting, bioaccumulation and excretion. Finally, direct in vivo imaging of nanomaterials is an exciting recent field that can provide real-time tracking of those nanocarriers. We review a range of systems suitable for in vivo imaging and monitoring of drug delivery, with an emphasis on most recently introduced molecular imaging modalities based on optical and hybrid contrast, such as fluorescent protein tomography and multispectral optoacoustic tomography. Overall, great potential is foreseen for nanocarriers in medical diagnostics, therapeutics and molecular targeting. A proposed roadmap for ongoing and future research directions is therefore discussed in detail with emphasis on the development of novel approaches for functionalization, targeting and imaging of nano-based drug delivery systems, a cutting-edge technology poised to change the ways medicine is administered. \u00a9 2010 Bhaskar et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Combined functional data from multispectral non-ionizing and non-invasive brain imaging", "abstract": "Ongoing research during the past few years, envisions the development of an integrated functional imaging methodology to study brain function in-vivo and ex-vivo through a multi-modal, multi-spectral approach using non-ionizing radiation to provide combined functional information from molecule to tissue level.

The most reliable method for localizing infection requires radiolabeling autologous white blood cells ex vivo. A compound that can be injected directly into a patient and can selectively image infectious foci will eliminate the drawbacks. The resolution of infection is associated with neutrophil apoptosis and necrosis presenting phosphatidylserine (PS) on the neutrophil outer leaflet. Targeting PS with intravenous administration of a PS-specific, near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore will permit localization of infectious foci by optical imaging. Methods: Bacterial infection and sterile inflammation were induced in separate groups (n=5) of mice. PS was targeted with a NIR fluorophore, PSVue\u00ae794 (2.7 pmol). Imaging was performed (ex=730 nm, em=830 nm) using Kodak Multispectral FX-Pro system. The contralateral normal thigh served as an individualized control. Confocal microscopy of normal and apoptotic neutrophils and bacteria confirmed PS specificity. Results: Lesions, with a 10-s image acquisition, were unequivocally visible at 5 min post-injection. At 3 h post-injection, the lesion to background intensity ratios in the foci of infection (6.6\u00b10.2) were greater than those in inflammation (3.2\u00b10.5). Image fusions confirmed anatomical locations of the lesions. Confocal microscopy determined the fluorophore specificity for PS. Conclusions: Targeting PS presented on the outer leaflet of apoptotic or necrotic neutrophils as well as gram-positive microorganism with PS-specific NIR fluorophore provides a sensitive means of imaging infection. Literature indicates that NIR fluorophores can be detected 7-14 cm deep in tissue.

The main goal of this work is the development of a novel optical image reconstruction method called multi spectral Cerenkov luminescence tomography (msCLT). The starting point of the msCLT reconstruction scheme is a set of 2D planar images acquired using several narrow bandpass filters. Because of the different tissues absorption at different wavelengths this provide distinctive information content that can be used for image reconstruction. More precisely the msCLT algorithm is based on a regularized iterative non-negative scheme in order to find the unknown source intensity solution, the theoretical Cerenkov emission spectrum was also included in the algorithm. In order to investigate the performances of the msCLT approach in vitro and in vivo imaging using 32P-ATP were performed by using the IVIS 200 (Caliper, a PerkinElmer company). A set of spatial resolution measurements were performed using a small capillary source placed between several slices of chicken breast at different depths.

However, because of complex photon transportation in biological tissue and boundary detection data with high noise, bioluminescent sources in deeper positions generally cannot be localized. In our previous work, we used achromatic or monochromatic measurements and an a priori permissible source region strategy to develop a multilevel adaptive finite-element algorithm. In this paper, we propose a spectrally solved tomographic algorithm with a posteriori permissible source region selection. Multispectral measurements, and anatomical and optical information first deal with the nonuniqueness of BLT and constrain the possible solution of source reconstruction. The use of adaptive mesh refinement and permissible source region based on a posteriori measures not only avoids the dimension disaster arising from the multispectral measured data but also reduces the ill-posedness of BLT and therefore improves the reconstruction quality. Reconsideration of the optimization method and related modifications further enhance reconstruction robustness and efficiency. We also incorporate into the method some improvements for reducing computational burdens.

Here, we propose multispectral PAFC with multiple dyes having distinctive absorption spectra as multicolor PA contrast agents. As a first step of our proof-of-concept, we characterized high-speed PAFC capability to monitor the clearance of three dyes (Indocyanine Green [ICG], Methylene Blue [MB], and Trypan Blue [TB]) in an animal model in vivo and in real time. We observed strong dynamic PA signal fluctuations, which can be associated with interactions of dyes with circulating blood cells and plasma proteins. PAFC demonstrated enumeration of circulating red and white blood cells labeled with ICG and MB, respectively, and detection of rare dead cells uptaking TB directly in bloodstream. The possibility for accurate measurements of various dye concentrations including Crystal Violet and Brilliant Green were verified in vitro using complementary to PAFC photothermal (PT) technique and spectrophotometry under batch and flow conditions.

This is important in many medical conditions including surgery and trauma with extensive blood loss, rapid fluid administration, and transfusion of red blood cells.

The migratory mechanism of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) is not completely elucidated, yet many of the initial studies have been based on current understanding of the leukocyte migration. A normal function of MSC is the ability of the cell to migrate to and repair wounded tissue. This wound healing property of MSC originates with migration towards inflammatory signals produced by the wounded environment [1]. A tumor and its microenvironment are capable of eliciting a similar inflammatory response from the MSC, thus resulting in migration of the MSC towards the tumor microenvironment. We have shown MSC migration both in vitro and in vivo. In this chapter, we elucidate several in vivo methods to study MSC migration and mobilization to the tumor microenvironment. The first model is an exogenous model of MSC migration that can be performed in both xenograft and syngenic systems with in vitro expanded MSC. The second model utilizes transgenic-fluorescent-colored mice to follow endogenous bone marrow components including MSC. The third technique enables us to analyze data from the transgenic model through multispectral imaging. Furthermore, the migratory phenotype of MSC can be exploited for use in tumor-targeted gene delivery therapy has been efficacious in animal model studies and is an anticipated therapeutic device in clinical trials. \u00a9 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "A molecular imaging paradigm to rapidly profile response to angiogenesis-directed therapy in small animals", "abstract": "Purpose: The development of novel angiogenesis-directed therapeutics is hampered by the lack of non-invasive imaging metrics capable of assessing treatment response.

Specifically, reporter gene (RG) expression may be used to signal certain molecular events as they occur in vivo. Objective: To compare the in vivo kinetics of a radiolabeled reporter probe (RP) specifically targeted by RG expression to a non\u2010specific radiolabel (NSL) in canine bone marrow cells (BMC). Cells were co\u2010labeled in vitro, transplanted into normal canine myocardium, and tracked using dual\u2010isotope SPECT. Methods: Following canine bone marrow harvest (n=1), BMCs were isolated, transfected with RG, and grown in culture for 4 weeks. Transfected cells (5.4\u00d7106) were then incubated with RP and NSL followed by direct injection into the left canine ventricle. The recipient of transplanted cells was also the donor. Forty 1\u2010hr SPECT images were acquired to obtain washout kinetics of RP and NSL. Time activity curves (TAC) were generated from SPECT region of interest analysis. After sacrifice, ex vivo measurements of RP and NSL activity remaining in the myocardium were made with a high purity germanium gamma\u2010ray well counter. Results: Decay\u2010corrected TACs demonstrated faster washout kinetics for RP compared to NSL with biological half\u2010lives of 19 and 39 hours, respectively. This suggests that RP loss is greater than that attributed to cell death alone and demonstrates differences in label stability. Ex vivo tissue analysis confirmed these results.

In this work we used combined two photon intrinsic fluorescence (TPE), second harmonic generation microscopy (SHG), fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and multispectral two photon emission detection (MTPE) to investigate different kinds of human ex-vivo fresh biopsies of bladder. Morphological and spectroscopic analyses allowed to characterize both healthy and pathological tissue samples in a good agreement with common routine histology. In particular, we examined tissue samples from bladder normal mucosa, and bladder carcinoma in-situ (CIS), finding both morphological and spectroscopic differences. From the morphological point of view, cancer cells appeared more elongated with respect to corresponding normal cells; they also exhibited a different nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. From the spectroscopic point of view, we found differences between the two tissue types in both spectral emission and fluorescence lifetime distribution. Even if further analysis, as well as a more significant statistics on a large number of samples would be helpful to discriminate between low and high grade cancer, our method is a promising tool to be used as diagnostic confirmation of histological results, as well as a diagnostic tool in a multiphoton endoscope or cystoscope to be used in in-vivo imaging applications. \u00a9 2009 SPIE-OSA.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Wide-field imaging of fluorescent deoxy-glucose in ex vivo malignant and normal breast tissue", "abstract": "Rapid in situ determination of surgical resection margins during breast cancer surgery would reduce patient time under anesthesia.

To date, the only effective treatment for melanoma remains surgical excision, therefore, the key to extended survival is early detection 2,3. Considering the large numbers of patients diagnosed every year and the limitations in accessing specialized care quickly, the development of objective in vivo diagnostic instruments to aid the diagnosis is essential. New techniques to detect skin cancer, especially non-invasive diagnostic tools, are being explored in numerous laboratories. Along with the surgical methods, techniques such as digital photography, dermoscopy, multispectral imaging systems (MelaFind), laser-based systems (confocal scanning laser microscopy, laser doppler perfusion imaging, optical coherence tomography), ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, are being tested. Each technique offers unique advantages and disadvantages, many of which pose a compromise between effectiveness and accuracy versus ease of use and cost considerations. Details about these techniques and omparisons are available in the literature 4. Infrared (IR) imaging was shown to be a useful method to diagnose the signs of certain diseases by measuring the local skin temperature. There is a large body of evidence showing that disease or deviation from normal functioning are accompanied by changes of the temperature of the body, which again affect the temperature of the skin 5,6. Accurate data about the temperature of the human body and skin can provide a wealth of information on the processes responsible for heat generation and thermoregulation, in particular the deviation from normal conditions, often caused by disease. However, IR imaging has not been widely recognized in medicine due to the premature use of the technology 7,8 several decades ago, when temperature measurement accuracy and the spatial resolution were inadequate and sophisticated image processing tools were unavailable. This situation changed dramatically in the late 1990s-2000s. Advances in IR instrumentation, implementation of digital image processing algorithms and dynamic IR imaging, which enables scientists to analyze not only the spatial, but also the temporal thermal behavior of the skin 9, allowed breakthroughs in the field. In our research, we explore the feasibility of IR imaging, combined with theoretical and experimental studies, as a cost effective, non-invasive, in vivo optical measurement technique for tumor detection, with emphasis on the screening and early detection of melanoma 10-13. In this study, we show data obtained in a patient study in which patients that possess a pigmented lesion with a clinical indication for biopsy are selected for imaging. We compared the difference in thermal responses between healthy and malignant tissue and compared our data with biopsy results.

Early identification of tissue at risk of ulcerating could enable proper preventive care, thereby reducing the incidence of foot ulceration. Furthermore, noninvasive assessment of tissue viability around already formed ulcers could inform the diabetes caregiver about the severity of the wound and help assess the need for amputation.

Two methods are described to analyze the in vivo hyperspectral measurements. The first method is based on the modified Beer-Lambert law and produces a map of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations in the dermis of the foot. The second is based on a two-layer optical model of skin and can retrieve not only oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations but also epidermal thickness and melanin concentration along with skin scattering properties.

To address this issue, a novel approach has been developed that combines MR diffusion imaging with multispectral (MS) analysis to quantify tumor tissue populations. K-means (KM) clustering of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), T2, and proton density (Mo) was employed to estimate the volumes of viable tumor tissue, necrosis, and neighboring subcutaneous adipose tissue in a human colorectal tumor xenograft mouse model. In a second set of experiments, the temporal evolution of the MS tissue classes in response to therapeutic intervention Apo2L/TRAIL and CPT-11 was observed. The multiple parameters played complementary roles in identifying the various tissues. The ADC was the dominant parameter for identifying regions of necrosis, whereas T2 identified two necrotic subpopulations, and Mo contributed to the differentiation of viable tumor from subcutaneous adipose tissue. MS viable tumor estimates (mean volume = 275 \u00b1 147 mm3) were highly correlated (r = 0.81, P < 0.01) with histological estimates (117 \u00b1 51 mm3).

The sensitivity of the MRI vascular parameters is also demonstrated, in combination with a multispectral analysis technique for segmenting tumor tissue to restrict the analysis to viable tumor tissue and exclude regions of necrosis.

In the present study the influence of the size of biodegradable nanoparticles was investigated in detail, combining in vivo and ex vivo analysis with comprehensive particle size characterizations. Polyethylene glycol-polyesters poly(lactide) block polymers were synthesized and used for the production of three defined, stable, and nontoxic near-infrared (NIR) dye-loaded nanoparticle batches. Size analysis based on asymmetrical field flow field fractionation coupled with multiangle laser light scattering and photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) revealed narrow size distribution and permitted accurate size evaluations.

Spectral unmixing is a useful technique in multispectral fluorescence imaging for reducing the effects of native tissue autofluorescence and separating multiple fluorescence probes in vivio. While spectral unmixing methods are well established in fluorescence microscopy, which typically rely on precharacterized spectra for each fluorophore. A spectral unmixing algorithm tailored for in vivo optical imaging that is able to find the signal distribution and the pure spectrum of each component is introduced. It is derived from multivariate curve resolution-alternative least square (MCR-ALS) method using multiple constraints such as nonnegative, equality, closure, unimodal, spectral range and normalization. The signal distribution maps help to separate autofluorescence from other probes in the raw images and hence provide better quantification and localization for each probe.

Toward addressing this barrier, we report advances in digital staining: fluorescence mosaics that show only nuclei, are digitally stained purple and overlaid on reflectance mosaics, which show only cellular cytoplasm and dermis, and are digitally stained pink.With digital staining, the appearance of confocal mosaics mimics the appearance of histology.

In this study we coupled spectral imaging with fluorescence and white light microscopy to develop new methods for quantifying autophagy and apoptosis. For autophagy, we employed multispectral imaging to examine spectral changes in the fluorescence of LC3-GFP, a chimeric protein commonly used to track autophagosome formation. We found that punctate autophagosome-associated LC3-GFP exhibited a spectral profile that was distinctly different from diffuse cytosolic LC3-GFP. We then exploited this shift in spectral quality to quantify the amount of autophagosome-associated signal in single cells. Hydroxychloroquine (CQ), an anti-malarial agent that increases autophagosomal number, significantly increased the punctate LC3-GFP spectral signature, providing proof-of-principle for this approach. For studying apoptosis, we employed the Prism and Reflector Imaging Spectroscopy System (PARISS ) hyperspectral imaging system to identify a spectral signature for active caspase-8 immunostaining in ex vivo tumor samples. This system was then used to rapidly quantify apoptosis induced by lexatumumab, an agonistic TRAIL-R2/DR5 antibody, in histological sections from a preclinical mouse model.

Microscopic imaging of fresh tissue samples can circumvent the cost and time associated with conventional histology. Further, intrinsic contrast can provide rich information about a tissue's composition, structure and function, and opens the potential for in-vivo imaging without the need for contrast agents. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we used hyperspectral two-photon microscopy to explore the characteristics of both normal and diseased gastrointestinal (GI) tissues, relying only on their endogenous fluorescence and second harmonic generation to provide contrast. We obtained hyperspectral data at subcellular resolution by acquiring images over a range of two-photon excitation wavelengths, and found excitation spectral signatures of specific tissue types based on our ability to clearly visualize morphology. We present the two-photon excitation spectral properties of four major tissue types that are present throughout the GI tract: epithelium, lamina propria, collagen, and lymphatic tissue. Using these four excitation signatures as basis spectra, linear unmixing strategies were applied to hyperspectral data sets of both normal and neoplastic tissue acquired in the colon and small intestine. Our results show that hyperspectral unmixing with excitation spectra allows segmentation, showing promise for blind identification of tissue types within a field of view, analogous to specific staining in conventional histology. The intrinsic spectral signatures of these tissue types provide information relating to their biochemical composition.

To analyze comparatively and as a function of age the simultaneous measurements of the proton density (PD), the relaxation times (T1 and T2), and the longitudinal to transverse relaxation times ratio (T1/T2) of brain regions known to accumulate iron preferentially. METHODS: Twenty-seven human subjects were scanned with the mixed turbo spin echo pulse sequence, which is multispectral in PD, T1, and T2. Quantitative MRI (Q-MRI) maps of PD, T1, T2, and T1/T2 were generated, and region of interest measurements were performed in 5 brain regions, namely, frontal white matter (WM), genu of corpus callosum, caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus. RESULTS: Relaxation time measurements are consistent with results of others and provide further confirmation to our basic understanding of the relaxation effects of iron stores in the brain. Specifically, we found that the iron-rich globus pallidus exhibits enhanced T1 and T2 relaxation relative the iron poorer gray matter tissues (caudate nucleus and putamen) and also relative to the WM matter tissues frontal WM and genu of the corpus callosum). We also observe that under riding this hypothesis-because we do not have independent confirmation-that iron caused relaxation enhancement, are the normal brain aging patterns, which suggest that the brain tissues become wetter with increasing age. Also noted is the virtual removal of age dependence observed for the T1/T2 ratio of WM tissues, further suggesting that this ratio may become of clinical significance in the diagnosis of neoplastic processes as well as for quantifying iron in tissue. CONCLUSIONS:: The theoretical underpinnings of published brain iron Q-MRI techniques have been reviewed.

Fortunately, the survival rate for early diagnosed patients is relatively high. Therefore, in vivo imaging plays an important role for the detection and treatment of the disease. Accurate prostate cancer localization with noninvasive imaging can be used to guide biopsy, radiotheraphy, and surgery as well as to monitor disease progression. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed with an endorectal coil provides higher prostate cancer localization accuracy, when compared to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). However, in general, a single type of MRI is not sufficient for reliable tumor localization. As an alternative, multispectral MRI, i.e., the use of multiple MRI-derived datasets, has emerged as a promising noninvasive imaging technique for the localization of prostate cancer; however almost all studies are with human readers. There is a significant inter and intraobserver variability for human readers, and it is substantially difficult for humans to analyze the large dataset of multispectral MRI. To solve these problems, this study presents an automated localization method using cost-sensitive support vector machines (SVMs) and shows that this method results in improved localization accuracy than classical SVM. Additionally, we develop a new segmentation method by combining conditional random fields (CRF) with a cost-sensitive framework and show that our method further improves cost-sensitive SVM results by incorporating spatial information.

However, the precise downstream effector mechanisms by which T cells mediate these diverse processes are undefined. In the current study the effects of immune modulation with sulfasalazine were evaluated in a mouse model of PcP-related Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (PcP-IRIS). Recovery of T cell-mediated immunity in Pneumocystis-infected immunodeficient mice restored host defense, but also initiated the marked pulmonary inflammation and severe pulmonary function deficits characteristic of IRIS. Sulfasalazine produced a profound attenuation of IRIS, with the unexpected consequence of accelerated fungal clearance. To determine whether macrophage phagocytosis is an effector mechanism of T cell-mediated Pneumocystis clearance and whether sulfasalazine enhances clearance by altering alveolar macrophage phagocytic activity, a novel multispectral imaging flow cytometer-based method was developed to quantify the phagocytosis of Pneumocystis in vivo. Following immune reconstitution, alveolar macrophages from PcP-IRIS mice exhibited a dramatic increase in their ability to actively phagocytose Pneumocystis. Increased phagocytosis correlated temporally with fungal clearance, and required the presence of CD4+ T cells. Sulfasalazine accelerated the onset of the CD4+ T cell-dependent alveolar macrophage phagocytic response in PcP-IRIS mice, resulting in enhanced fungal clearance. Furthermore, sulfasalazine promoted a TH2-polarized cytokine environment in the lung, and sulfasalazine-enhanced phagocytosis of Pneumocystis was associated with an alternatively activated alveolar macrophage phenotype. These results provide evidence that macrophage phagocytosis is an important in vivo effector mechanism for T cell-mediated Pneumocystis clearance, and that macrophage phenotype can be altered to enhance phagocytosis without exacerbating inflammation. Immune modulation can diminish pulmonary inflammation while preserving host defense, and has therapeutic potential for the treatment of PcP-related immunopathogenesis. \u00a9 2010 Wang et al.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Distinguished photons: increased contrast with multispectral in vivo fluorescence imaging.", "abstract": "Noninvasive in vivo imaging is a rapidly growing field with applications in basic biology, drug discovery and clinical medicine.

To correlate in vivo spatial and spectral morphologic changes of short- to long-pulse 532 nm Nd:YAG retinal laser lesions using Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (FD OCT), autofluorescence (AF), fluorescein angiography (FA), and multispectral imaging. Methods. Ten eyes with treatment-naive preproliferative or proliferative diabetic retinopathy were studied. A titration grid of laser burns at 20, 100, and 200 milliseconds was applied to the nasal retina and laser fluence titrated to produce four grades of laser lesion visibility: subvisible (SV), barely visible (BV, light-gray), threshold (TH, gray-white), and suprathreshold (ST, white). The AF, FA, FD-OCT, and multispectral imaging were performed 1 week before laser, and 1 hour, 4 weeks, and 3 and 6 months post-laser. Multispectral imaging measured relative tissue oxygen concentration. Results. Laser burn visibility and lesion size increased in a linear relationship according to fixed fluence levels. At fixed pulse durations, there was a semilogarithmic increase in lesion size over 6 months. At 20 milliseconds, all grades of laser lesion were reduced significantly in size after 6 months: SV, 51%; BV, 54%; TH, 49%; and ST, 50% (P < 0.001), with retinal pigment epithelial proliferation and photoreceptor infilling. At 20 milliseconds, there was healing of photoreceptor inner segment/ outer segment junction layers compared with 100- and 200-millisecond lesions. Significant increases in mean tissue oxygenation (range, four to six units) within the laser titration area and in oxygen concentration across the laser lesions (P < 0.01) were detected at 6 months.Conclusions. For patients undergoing therapeutic laser, there may be improved tissue oxygenation, higher predictability of burn morphology, and more spatial localization of healing responses of burns at 20 milliseconds compared with longer pulse durations over time. \u00a9 2011 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "In vivo optical molecular imaging of vascular endothelial growth factor for monitoring cancer treatment", "abstract": "Purpose: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression is a critical component in tumor growth and metastasis. Capabilities to monitor VEGF expression in vivo can potentially serve as a useful tool for diagnosis, prognosis, treatment planning, monitoring, and research. Here, we present the first report of in vivo hyperspectral molecular imaging strategy capable of monitoring treatment-induced changes in VEGF expression. Experimental Design: VEGF was targeted with an anti-VEGF antibody conjugated with a fluorescent dye and was imaged in vivo using a hyperspectral imaging system. The strategy was validated by quantitatively monitoring VEGF levels in three different tumors as well as following photodynamic treatment. Specificity of the molecular imaging strategy was tested using in vivo competition experiments and mathematically using a quantitative pharmacokinetic model. Results: The molecular imaging strategy successfully imaged VEGF levels quantitatively in three different tumors and showed concordance with results from standard ELISA. Changes in tumoral VEGF concentration following photodynamic treatment and Avastin treatment were shown. Immunohistochemistry shows that (a) the VEGF-specific contrast agent labels both proteoglycanbound and unbound VEGF in the extracellular space and (b) the bound VEGF is released from the extracellular matrix in response to photodynamic therapy, in vivo competition experiments and quantitative pharmacokinetic model-based analysis confirmed the high specificity of the imaging strategy. Conclusion: This first report of in vivo quantitative optical molecular imaging-based monitoring of a secreted cytokine in tumors may have implications in providing tools for mechanistic investigations as well as for improved treatment design and merits further investigation. \u00a9 2008 American Association for Cancer Research.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Real-time imaging of de novo arteriovenous malformation in a mouse model of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia", "abstract": "Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are vascular anomalies where arteries and veins are directly connected through a complex, tangled web of abnormal arteries and veins instead of a normal capillary network.

So far it has never been applied to the Olfactory Bulb (OB), although this structure is particularly well suited to the optical study of brain activation due to the its well defined organization, the ability to physiologically activate it with odorants, and the low depth of the activated layers. To obtain hemodynamics parameters from reflectance variations data, it is necessary to take into account a corrective factor called Differential Pathlength (DP). It is routinely estimated using Monte Carlo simulations, modeling photons propagation in simplified infinite geometry tissue models. The first goal of our study was to evaluate the influence of more realistic layered geometries and optical properties on the calculation of DP and ultimately on the estimation of the hemodynamics parameters. Since many valuable results have been obtained previously by others in the SSc, for the purpose of validation and comparison we performed Monte Carlo simulations in both the SSC and the OB. We verified the assumption of constant DP during activation by varying the hemoglobin oxygen saturation, total hemoglobin concentration and we also studied the effect of a superficial bone layer on DP estimation for OB. The simulations show the importance of defining a finite multilayer model instead of the coarse infinite monolayer model, especially for the SSc, and demonstrate the need to perform DP calculation for each structure taking into account their anatomofunctional properties.

Multiscale endoscopy platforms that use widefield imaging are needed to better direct the placement of high-resolution probes. Design: Feasibility study. Objective: This study evaluated the feasibility of a single agent, proflavine hemisulfate, as a contrast medium during both widefield and high-resolution imaging to characterize the morphologic changes associated with a variety of GI conditions. Setting: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, and Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, New York. Patients, Interventions, and Main Outcome Measurements: Resected specimens were obtained from 15 patients undergoing EMR, esophagectomy, or colectomy. Proflavine hemisulfate, a vital fluorescent dye, was applied topically. The specimens were imaged with a widefield multispectral microscope and a high-resolution microendoscope. The images were compared with histopathologic examination. Results: Widefield fluorescence imaging enhanced visualization of morphology, including the presence and spatial distribution of glands, glandular distortion, atrophy, and crowding. High-resolution imaging of widefield abnormal areas revealed that neoplastic progression corresponded to glandular heterogeneity and nuclear crowding in dysplasia, with glandular effacement in carcinoma. These widefield and high-resolution image features correlated well with the histopathologic features. Limitations: This imaging approach must be validated in vivo with a larger sample size. Conclusions: Multiscale proflavine-enhanced fluorescence imaging can delineate epithelial changes in a variety of GI conditions. Distorted glandular features seen with widefield imaging could serve as a critical bridge to high-resolution probe placement.

Such high resolution fluorescence imaging is hampered by unwanted signal from intrinsic background fluorescence and scattered light. The signal to background ratio can be improved by using extrinsic contrast agents and greatly enhanced by multispectral imaging methods. Unfortunately, these methods are insufficient for deep tissue imaging where high contrast and speedy acquisition are necessary. Fluorescence lifetime (FLT) is an inherent characteristic of each fluorescent species that can be independent of intensity and spectral properties. Accordingly, FLT-based detection provides an additional contrast mechanism to optical measurements. This contrast is particularly important in the near-infrared (NIR) due to relative transparency of tissue as well as the broad absorption and emission spectra of dyes that are active in this region. Here we report comparative analysis of signal distribution of several NIR fluorescent polymethine dyes in living mice and their correlations with lifetimes obtained in vitro using solution models. The FLT data obtained from dyes dissolved in serum albumin solution correlated well with FLTs measured in vivo. Thus the albumin solution model could be used as a good predictive model for in vivo FLT behavior of newly developed fluorescent reporters. Subsequent experiments in vivo, including monitoring slow release kinetics and detecting proteinuria, demonstrate the complementary nature of FLT for fluorescence intensity imaging. \u00a9 2009 SPIE.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Fast multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) for dynamic imaging of pharmacokinetics and biodistribution in multiple organs", "abstract": "The characterization of pharmacokinetic and biodistribution profiles is an essential step in the development process of new candidate drugs or imaging agents.

It is not uncommon to have a diagnosis confirmed 5 to 10 years after the initial onset of symptoms. Development of a more-sensitive molecular imaging technology to detect structural changes in the joints would lead to earlier diagnosis and quantitative tracking of ankylosis progression. Progressive ankylosis (ank/ank) mice have a loss of function in the Ank gene, which codes for a regulator of PPi transport. In this study, we used these ank/ank mutant mice to assess a noninvasive, quantitative measure of joint ankylosis with near-infrared (NIR) molecular imaging in vivo.Methods: Three age groups (8, 12, and 18 weeks) of ank/ank (15 mice) and wild-type littermates (12 +/+ mice) were assessed histologically and radiographically. Before imaging, OsteoSense 750 (bisphosphonate pamidronate) was injected i.v. Whole-body images were analyzed by using the multispectral Maestro imaging system.Results: OsteoSense 750 signals in the paw joints were higher in ank/ank mice in all three age groups compared with controls. In the spine, significantly higher OsteoSense 750 signals were detected early, in 8-week-old ank/ank mice compared with controls, although minimal radiographic differences were noted at this time point. The molecular imaging changes in the ank/ank spine (8 weeks) were supported by histologic changes, including calcium apatite crystals at the edge of the vertebral bodies and new syndesmophyte formation.Conclusions: Changes in joint pathology of ank/ank mice, as evaluated by histologic and radiographic means, are qualitative, but only semiquantitative. In contrast, molecular imaging provides a quantitative assessment. Ankylosis in ank/ank mice developed simultaneously in distal and axial joints, contrary to the previous notion that it is a centripetal process. NIR imaging might be feasible for early disease diagnosis and for monitoring disease progression in ankylosing spondylitis. \u00a9 2011 Tsui et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Validation of a fiber-based confocal microscope for interventional image-guided procedures: Correlation with multispectral optical imaging", "abstract": "The concept of the biopsy is ubiquitous in current medical diagnosis of cancer and other diseases.

Optical imaging modalities have shown a great potential to provide high spatiotemporal resolution and quantitative imaging of pO2 based on hemoglobin absorption in visible and near infrared range of optical spectrum. However, multispectral measurement of cerebral blood oxygenation relies on photon migration through the highly scattering brain tissue. Estimation and modeling of tissue optical parameters, which may undergo dynamic changes during the experiment, is typically required for accurate estimation of blood oxygenation. On the other hand, estimation of the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) based on oxygen-dependent quenching of phosphorescence should not be significantly affected by the changes in the optical parameters of the tissue and provides an absolute measure of pO2. Experimental systems that utilize oxygen-sensitive dyes have been demonstrated in in vivo studies of the perfused tissue as well as for monitoring the oxygen content in tissue cultures, showing that phosphorescence quenching is a potent technology capable of accurate oxygen imaging in the physiological pO2 range.

This is because tissue attenuation in this spectral band is relatively low, allowing optical photons even from deep sites in tissue to reach the animal surface and consequently be detected by a CCD camera. The wavelength dependence of tissue optical properties within the 680-850 nm band can be exploited for emitted light by measuring fluorescent data via multispectral approaches and incorporating the spectral dependence of these optical properties into the OFT inverse problem - that of reconstructing underlying 3D fluorescent probe distributions from optical data collected on the animal surface. However, in the aforementioned spectral band, due to only small variations in the tissue optical properties, multispectral emission data, though superior for image reconstruction compared to achromatic data, tend to be somewhat redundant. A different spectral approach for OFT is to capitalize on the larger variations in the optical properties of tissue for excitation photons than for the emission photons by using excitation at multiple wavelengths as a means of decoding source depth in tissue. The full potential of spectral approaches in OFT can be realized by a synergistic combination of these two approaches, that is, exciting the underlying fluorescent probe at multiple wavelengths and measuring emission data multispectrally. In this paper, we describe a method that incorporates both excitation and emission spectral information into the OFT inverse problem. We describe a linear algebraic formulation of the multiple wavelength illumination-multispectral detection forward model for OFT and compare it to models that use only excitation at multiple wavelengths or those that use only multispectral detection techniques.

Conclusions: These findings strongly suggest that the primo-vascular system may be an additional metastasis route, complementing the lymphatic and hematogenous routes, which facilitate the dissemination and colonization of cancer cells at secondary sites. \u00a9 2010 Academy of Molecular Imaging and Society for Molecular Imaging.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Fast and noninvasive fluorescence imaging of biological tissues in vivo using a flying-spot scanner", "abstract": "We have developed a flying-spot scanner (FSS), for fluorescence imaging of tissues in vivo. The FSS is based on the principles of single-pixel illumination and detection via a raster scanning technique. The principal components of the scanner are a laser light source, a pair of horizontal and vertical scanning mirrors to deflect the laser light in these respective directions on the tissue surface, and a photo multiplier tube (PMT) detector. This paper characterizes the performance of the FSS for fluorescence imaging of tissues in vivo. First, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analysis is presented. This is followed by characterization of the experimental SNR, linearity and spatial resolution of the FSS. Finally, the feasibility of tissue fluorescence imaging is demonstrated using an animal model. In summary, the performance of the FSS is comparable to that of fluorescence-imaging systems based on multipixel illumination and detection. The primary advantage of the FSS is the order-of-magnitude reduction in the cost of the light source and detector. However, the primary disadvantage of the FSS its significantly slower frame rate (1 Hz). In applications where high frame rates are not critical, the FSS will represent a low-cost alternative to multichannel fluorescence imaging-systems.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Hyperspectral diagnostic imaging of the cervix: Report on a new investigational device", "abstract": "Objective. To describe our experience with a noncontact in vivo fluorescence imaging device for the detection and localization of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Materials and methods. Sixty-two women with abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) smears, and 4 women with normal Pap smears, were recruited to undergo fluorescence imaging of the cervix during colposcopy. After topically applying dilute acetic acid, the surface of the cervix was scanned with 365 nm ultraviolet light for about 12 sec. Colposcopy and biopsies of visualized lesions were then performed. The fluorescence emission curves generated by normal cervical tissue and various states of cervical pathology were inspected and assigned relative scores of 1-5 based on the height and slope of the curves at peak fluorescence emissions. A score of 1 indicated a curve with high magnitude and distinct peak, and a score of 5 described a curve of low magnitude and rounded/flattened peak. Scores of 2-4 represented curves with incremental changes of about 25% in the height of the curve between scores of 1 and 5. Biopsies were classified as high grade (HG, CIN 2/3), low grade (LG, HPV/CIN 1), or nondysplastic (ND). Among women with abnormal Pap smears, only those who had biopsies with concordant interpretations by two independent pathologists were included in the descriptive analysis. All of the patients with normal Pap smears were included. Results. A total of 35 women were included in the analysis. Of 62 women with abnormal Pap smears who underwent fluorescence imaging and colposcopy, 31 met the inclusion criteria. Among these 31 women, Pap smears consisted of 6 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), 16 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LGSILs), and 9 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HGSILs). Of the 4 women with normal Pap smears, 1 had an abnormal colposcopy and a nondysplastic biopsy. Among all 35 women, 42 total biopsies were included, consisting of 11 HG, 25 LG, and 6 ND. Normal squamous tissue generated a score of 1, normal metaplastic tissue a score of 2 or 3, and normal columnar tissue of score of 5 in 35/35 (100%) women. Among the 11 HG lesions, 8 had a score of 4 and 2 had a score of 5. One case was uninterpretable due to a low signal-to-noise ratio. Among the 25 LG lesions, 15 had a score of 3, 6 had a score of 4 or 5, 2 had a score of 1, and 2 cases were uninterpretable. Conclusions. HG lesions generated spectra distinct from normal tissue in 8/10 (80%) evaluable cases, but LG lesions generated spectra indistinguishable from that of normal metaplastic tissue.

There is growing evidence that the success of such procedures depends on the composition of the plaque. In this study, this problem has been addressed by applying tissue characterisation techniques to intravascular ultrasound data obtained from a set of in vitro specimens of known pathology using a radiofrequency data acquisition system interfaced to a commercial intravascular scanner. We found that the attenuation slope of plaque is significantly increased in areas of nonfibrous plaque. This increase in attenuation slope is sufficiently high to allow it to be parametrically imaged and combined with gray-scale imaging as a color overlay. Comparison with histologic sections shows that nonfibrous plaque can be detected even when it is not visible on the gray-scale image. In addition, specular reflections may be readily distinguished from calcifications. Limited in vivo studies are consistent with the hypothesis that there is a relationship between plaque dissection and areas (probably calcification) detected by this method. \u00a9 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.", "db": "scopus"}, {"title": "Visible and infrared hyperspectral visualization of normal and ischemic tissue", "abstract": "We have developed a ne in-vivo spectroscopic imaging system (IVIS) for real-time biomedical applications.

The optical diagnosis system was based on an OPO laser for multi-wavelength excitation and time-resolved detection. The pulsed Nd-YAG-pumped OPO laser system (6 ns, 20 Hz) is compact and has a rapid, broad, and uniform tuning range. Time-gated detection of intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) making use of external triggering was used to effectively eliminate the laser scattering and contribute to the highly sensitive in vivo measurements. Artificial tissue-simulating phantoms consisting of polystyrene microspheres and tissue fluorophores were tested to optimize the gating parameters. 51-ns gate width and 39-ns gate delays were determined to be the optimal parameters for sensitive detection. In vivo measurements with the optical diagnosis system were applied to esophagus, stomach, and small intestine using an endoscope in canine animal studies. The rapid tuning capability of the optical diagnosis system contributed greatly to the optimization of wavelength for the observation of porphyrin in the small intestine. When the small intestine was thoroughly washed with water, the emission band which corresponds to porphyrin disappeared. Based on this observation, it was concluded that the detected signal was yielded by porphyrin-containing bile secretion. Also, multispectral analyses using multiple excitations from 415 to 480 nm at 5 nm intervals confirmed the porphyrin detection in the small intestine. The optical diagnosis system was also applied to the detection of human xenograft of oral carcinoma in mice using 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) which is a photodynamic therapy (PDT) drug. Significant differences in protoporphyrin IX fluorescence intensity between normal and tumor tissue could be obtained 2 hours after the injection of 5-ALA into mice due to the preferential accumulation of 5-ALA in tumors.

Originally based on luminance contrast only, there is now interest in false color multispectral imaging in selected spectral bands to improve tissue differentiation. Some success has been achieved, but the scientific basis for the results was unknown. This research is concerned with measurements of the diffuse transmittance of breast tissues as a function of wavelength in the 600\u00e2\u0080\u00931060 nm range (and calculations of contrast with a one dimensional diffusion theory model). Carcinoma and glandular tissues were found to have similar spectral transmittances with an increase in transmittance between 750 and 900 nm, and an absorption window around 960 nm. Adipose tissue showed a distinct transmittance minimum at 930 nm. In vivo measurement of an intact normal breast showed a minimum at about 825 nm, as yet unexplained. The transmittance data and reflectance data were used to derive the scattering and absorption coefficients. The diffusion length was also determined from radiance versus depth measurements. These coefficients were used for calculations of contrast in a one dimensional slab model, with and without a layer of cancerous tissue positioned between two slabs of normal tissue. \u00a9 1983, American Institute of Physics for the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Their ability to form viscous gels is used to immobilize or encapsulate yeast, enzymes, living cells and drugs. Calcium-alginate fibers are extensively used in wound dressings since exhibit antihaemostatic and healing properties. The problem with alginate-made dressings in surgery is their slow biodegradability: if entrapped within tissues, they can induce a local cellular recruitment with an inflammatory response contemporaneous to the resorption phase. In part, this problem is a consequence of poor solubility of the calcium alginates in water. Although calcium alginate fibers can exchange calcium ions with sodium ions from the wound exudate to create a calcium/sodium alginate fibers, the residual alginates are thought to be not totally degradable in vivo. Rapid and non-destructive characterization of series of the crude alginates and calcium alginate fibers has been performed using Raman spectroscopy with near infrared excitation.

In the present study, local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from three tracks during microelectrode recording-based (MER) targeting of STN, in five patients. The raw LFP data were preprocessed in original recording setup and then data quality was compared to data with common average derivation. The depth-frequency maps were generated according to preprocessing results for each patient and spectral characteristics of LFPs were explored at each depth across different tracks and different subjects. Spatio-spectral analysis of LFP was investigated to see whether LFP activity can be used for optimal track selection and STN border identification. Analysis show that monopolar derivation suffer from various artifacts and/or power line noise which makes the interpretation of target localization very difficult in most of the subjects. Unlikely, bipolar derivation helps to recover the neurological signals and investigation of signal characteristics. The frequency-vs-depth maps using a modified Welch periodogram with robust statistics, demonstrated that a median-based spectrum estimation approach eliminates outliers pretty well by preserving band-specific LFP activity. The results indicate that there is a clear oscillatory beta activity around 20 Hz in all subjects. 1/f normalization reveals the high frequency oscillations (HFOs) between 200-to-350 Hz in two subjects. It's noted that the optimal track selection is not consistent with the track having highest beta band oscillations in two out of five subjects. In conclusion, microelectrode-derived LFP recordings may provide an alternative approach to single unit activity (SUA)-based MER, for localizing the target STN borders during DBS surgery.

The neurosurgeon usually finds several problems to detect tumour tissues by the naked eye. In order to address this problem, this work makes use of high spectral resolution samples in the range from 400 nm to 6000 nm, provided by an Agilent Resolutions Pro V.5 spectrometer that has been diagnosed by histopathology. This instrument can sample a single pixel with a very high spectral resolution. The high spectral resolution allows a reliable separation between the different tissues in brain tumour.

The 225 used samples come from 25 adults (males and females) and have been taken at different surgical procedures at the University Hospital of Southampton. The main goal is to discriminate between tumour tissue and normal tissue.

From March 2000 till March 2010, 839 neurosurgical procedures directed on resection of such neoplasms were performed in the intelligent operating theater of Tokyo Women's Medical University with the use of intraoperative MRI, real-time updated neuronavigation system, and Hi-vision operative microscope. To facilitate maximal possible tumor resection with minimal risk of neurological morbidity a special device, called Intraoperative Examination Monitor for Awake Surgery (IEMAS) was developed by us. It provides an opportunity to visualize a wide spectrum of inraoperative information related to condition of the patient, nuances of the surgical procedure, and details of the cortical mapping. The wide set of both anatomical and functional parameters, such as view of the patient's mimic and face movements during answering on the specific questions, type of examination test, position of the surgical instruments, parameters of the bispectral index monitor, and general view of the surgical field through the operating microscope and/or endoscope, is presented compactly in one screen with several displays, which allows fast integrated real-time analysis of the multiple data, nearly without interruption of the surgical manipulations. All members of the surgical team can share this information using several in-room liquid crystal displays. However, the initially designed IEMAS system was occasionally affected by interruption or detachment of the connecting cables, which could interfere with effective advancement of the surgical procedure. To avoid this problem a modified device was created. Its specific feature is wireless information transmitting function attained by incorporation of transmitters with a frequency range of 2.4 GHz. The clinical testing of this system was initiated on February 1, 2010, but quickly revealed crossed line effect between transmitters and receivers. To overcome this obstacle and to isolate transmitters, one channel was changed from wireless connection into wired, which resulted in significant improvement of the clearness of both transmitted images and sounds, and provides an opportunity for effective clinical use of the device.

In each session, electrocardiogram and gastric barostat measurements were conducted before and after a caloric liquid meal. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) brain scans were performed on a separate day. Analysis of autonomic function was accomplished through power spectral analysis of heart rate variability which revealed that the sympthovagal balance was significantly decreased after GES therapy, indicating a significant increase in vagal activity. Results from gastric barostat measurements demonstrated that during GES there was a significant increase in the discomfort threshold for both pressure and volume. Quantitative analysis of PET imaged cerebral activity showed that chronic GES increased thalamic activity.

Results: 15 GBM and 4 WHO grade III glioma patients in the FGS group and 18 GBM and 4 WHO grade III glioma patients in the WLS group were enrolled. The detection rate of NIR-II fluorescence was 100% for GBM. The complete resection rate was significantly increased by the FGS for GBM (FGS, 100% [95% CI 73.41-100] vs. WLS, 50% [95% CI 29.03-70.97], P = 0.0036).

Preoperatively acquired 3D images are used for planning the procedure, and are also employed in intraoperative navigations to help localize and resect brain lesions. However, as the operation progresses, multiple factors contribute to changes that limit the accuracy of the navigation based on pre-operative images alone. Our method to correct for brain shift involves the use of ultrasound intraoperatively to update patient specific pre-operative MRI scans using a physics based dynamic model. To validate the imaging and modeling process, a phantom was designed that simulates the brain and its shifting patterns resulting from several of the clinical factors present during a brain operation. MRI and ultrasound datasets were acquired for several permutations of phantom parameters. Deformation algorithms were then applied to the phantom data to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach as a method to effectively update the pre-operatively acquired MRI data during an operation.", "db": "ieee"}, {"title": "Automatic intra-operative localization of STN using the beta band frequencies of microelectrode recordings", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered a surgical treatment alternative for Parkinson disease (PD) patients with intractable tremor or for those patients who are affected by long-term complications of levodopa therapy such as motor fluctuations and severe dyskinesias.

Unlike normal cases, untreated Parkinsonian states in basal ganglia structures produce oscillations at various frequencies, the most prominent of which is a synchronization in the beta frequency band recorded in the subthalamic nucleus (STN).

In this study, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) at various depths along the trajectory to Vim in three ET patients. LFP recordings at various depths were processed by a PCA based de-noising method to remove ECG artifacts. The spectral characteristics of LFPs were investigated via frequency-vs-depth maps using a modified Welch periodogram using robust statistics, and further analyzed within different sub-bands to determine whether LFP activity encodes characteristic patterns for the identification of disease-specific subcortical areas. Our results demonstrated that a median-based spectrum estimation approach eliminates outliers better than the traditional averaging technique by preserving band-specific LFP activity. Results indicate that there was clear oscillatory beta activity around 20 Hz in two subjects. One patient displayed relatively high gamma (40 Hz) activity in the sub-thalamic region.

The objective was to measure changes in brain activity as a function of a change in the slave arm positioning. In the experiment, the brain activity of four participants was measured using fNIRS while they used a hand controller to move the virtual arm of a surgical simulator. The experiment was carried out with the virtual arm in two positions: one easy to control and the other difficult.

All patients showed significant fMRI activation evoked by motor and language tasks. After the craniotomy, we recorded ECoG activity by placing subdural grids directly on the exposed brain surface. Each patient performed motor and language tasks and demonstrated realtime HGA dynamics in hand motor areas and parts of the inferior frontal gyrus. Sensitivity and specificity of HGA mapping were 100% compared to ECS mapping in the frontal lobe, which suggested HGA mapping precisely indicated eloquent cortices. The investigation times of HGA mapping was significantly shorter than that of ECS mapping. Specificities of the motor and language-fMRI, however, did not reach 85%.

In this study, we numerically showed how 3D-printed acoustic holograms allow to correct the skull aberrations and to produce a large and localized focusing along a pediatric brain tumor. Several targeting configurations were numerically studied aiming to increase the covered tumor volume while reducing the off-target coverage. Fluid-like tissue simulations were performed using the k-space method.

Over the past decades, much effort has been directed toward the graph modeling of SC, in which the brain SC is generally considered as relatively invariant. However, the graph representation of SC is unable to directly describe the connections between anatomically unconnected brain regions and fail to model the negative functional correlations. Here, we extend the static graph model to a spatiotemporal varying hypergraph Laplacian diffusion (STV-HGLD) model to describe the propagation of the spontaneous neural activity in human brain by incorporating the Laplacian of the hypergraph representation of the structural connectome ( ${h}$ SC) into the regular wave equation. Theoretical solution shows that the dynamic functional couplings between brain regions fluctuate in the form of an exponential wave regulated by the spatiotemporal varying Laplacian of  ${h}$ SC. Empirical study suggests that the cortical wave might give rise to resonance with SC during the self-organizing interplay between excitation and inhibition among brain regions, which orchestrates the cortical waves propagating with harmonics emanating from the  ${h}$ SC while being bound by the natural frequencies of SC. Besides, the average statistical dependencies between brain regions, normally defined as the functional connectivity (FC), arises just at the moment before the cortical wave reaches the steady state after the wave spreads across all the brain regions.

DBS outcome depends on accurate stimulation of the STN sensorimotor area which is a trial-and-error procedure taking place during and after surgery. Pathologically enhanced beta-band (13-35 Hz) oscillatory activity across the cortico-basal ganglia pathways is a prominent neurophysiological phenomenon associated with PD. We hypothesized that weighing together beta-band frequency peaks from simultaneous microelectrode recordings in \u201coff-state\u201d PD patients could map the individual neuroanatomical variability and serve as a biomarker for the location of the STN sensorimotor neurons. We validated our hypothesis with 9 and 11 patients that, respectively, responded well and poorly to bilateral DBS, after at least two years of follow up. We categorized \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cpoor\u201d DBS responders based on their clinical assessment alongside a > 40% and <;30% change, respectively, in \u201coff\u201d unified PD rating scale motor scores. Good (poor) DBS responders had, in average, 1 mm (3.5 mm) vertical distance between the maximum beta-peak weighted across the parallel microelectrodes and the center of the stimulation area. The distances were statistically different in the two groups (p = 0.0025).

Higher-resolution electrodes are of interest for both current clinical applications, providing access to more precise neural activity localization and novel applications, such as neural prosthetics, where current information density and spatial resolution is insufficient to suitably decode signals for a chronic brain-machine interface. Developing such electrodes is not trivial because their small contact area increases the electrode impedance, which seriously affects the signal-to-noise ratio, and adhering such an electrode to the brain surface becomes critical. The most straightforward approach requires increasing the array conformability with flexible substrates while improving the electrode performance using materials with superior electrochemical properties. In this paper, we propose an ultra-flexible and conformable polyimide-based micro-ECoG array of submillimeter recording sites electrochemically coated with high surface area conductive polymer-carbon nanotube composites to improve their brain-electrical coupling capabilities. We characterized our devices both electrochemically and by recording from rat somatosensory cortex in vivo. The performance of the coated and uncoated electrodes was directly compared by simultaneously recording the same neuronal activity during multiwhisker deflection stimulation.

High-frequency oscillations (HFOs, > 80 Hz) are promising biomarkers of the EZ that are typically localized using intracranial electroencephalography (icEEG). The goal of this study was to localize the cortical generators of HFOs non-invasively using high-density (HD) EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) and validate the localization against the gold-standard given by the icEEGdefined HFO-zone. Methods: We analyzed simultaneous HDEEG and MEG data from six children with MRE who underwent icEEG and surgery. We detected interictal HFOs (80-160 Hz) on HD-EEG and MEG separately, using an inhouse automatic detector followed by visual human review, and distinguished between HFOs with and without spikes. We localized the cortical generators of each HFO on HD-EEG or MEG using the wavelet Maximum Entropy on the Mean (wMEM). For the HFOs localized in the brain area covered by icEEG, we estimated the localization error (Eloc) with respect to the gold-standard, and classified them as either concordant (Eloc\u226415mm) or not. Results: We found that: (i) HD-EEG presented a higher rate of HFOs than MEG (1 vs 0.5 HFOs/min, p=0.031); (ii) HFOs without spikes were more likely to be localized outside the brain regions of interest (i.e. covered by icEEG) than HFOs with spikes; and (iii) both HD-EEG and MEG showed high precision to the gold-standard (92% and 96%). Conclusion: We reported quantitative evidence that HDEEG and MEG can localize the HFO cortical generators with high precision to the icEEG gold-standard in children with MRE, suggesting that they may possibly limit the need for icEEG prior to surgery. We also showed that HFOs with spikes on HD-EEG/MEG are more likely to be epileptogenic than those independent from spikes, which may represent physiological events from normal brain.", "db": "ieee"}, {"title": "Patient-Specific Simulations of Deep Brain Stimulation Electric Field with Aid of In-house Software ELMA", "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established technique for reduction of symptoms in movement disorders.

Especially, its counterpart in frequency domain, spectral GC, as well as other Granger-like causality measures have recently been applied to study causal interactions between brain areas in different frequency ranges during cognitive and perceptual tasks. In this paper, we show that: 1) GC in time domain cannot correctly determine how strongly one time series influences the other when there is directional causality between two time series, and 2) spectral GC and other Granger-like causality measures have inherent shortcomings and/or limitations because of the use of the transfer function (or its inverse matrix) and partial information of the linear regression model. On the other hand, we propose two novel causality measures (in time and frequency domains) for the linear regression model, called new causality and new spectral causality, respectively, which are more reasonable and understandable than GC or Granger-like measures. Especially, from one simple example, we point out that, in time domain, both new causality and GC adopt the concept of proportion, but they are defined on two different equations where one equation (for GC) is only part of the other (for new causality), thus the new causality is a natural extension of GC and has a sound conceptual/theoretical basis, and GC is not the desired causal influence at all. By several examples, we confirm that new causality measures have distinct advantages over GC or Granger-like measures. Finally, we conduct event-related potential causality analysis for a subject with intracranial depth electrodes undergoing evaluation for epilepsy surgery, and show that, in the frequency domain, all measures reveal significant directional event-related causality, but the result from new spectral causality is consistent with event-related time-frequency power spectrum activity.

In this paper, deep learning CNN with a range of different architectures is designed for identifying related activities from raw electroencephalography (EEG). Specifically, an improved short-time Fourier transform is used to stand for the time-frequency information after extracting the spectral images of the original EEG as input to CNN. Then CNN models are designed and trained to predict the DOA levels from EEG spectrum without handcrafted features, which presents an intuitive mapping process with high efficiency and reliability. As a result, the best trained CNN model achieved an accuracy of 93.50%, interpreted as CNN's deep learning to approximate the DOA by senior anesthesiologists, which highlights the potential of deep CNN combined with advanced visualization techniques for EEG-based brain mapping.", "db": "ieee"}, {"title": "3D Convolutional Neural Network Segmentation of White Matter Tract Masks from MR Diffusion Anisotropy Maps", "abstract": "This paper presents an application of 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques to compute the white matter region spanned by a fiber tract (the tract mask) from whole-brain MRI diffusion anisotropy maps.

MEG has been approved as an efficient and powerful functional detection method which has been used in clinical practices relate with epilepsy, depression, and other diseases that cannot be well-diagnosed by traditional structural methods, e.g., CT and MRI. By using MEG, very weak magnetic signals typically in the range of 10 femtotesla (fT)-1 picotesla (pT) that originate from electric currents flowing in neurons, can be recorded. Compared with scalp EEG, MEG provides much better spatial resolution. Meanwhile, MEG is a noninvasive technology for preoperative workup for epilepsy surgery, which means it may replace traditional invasive methods. As the development of high-sampling rate MEG systems as well as the discovery high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in the brain, MEG is now typically digitally analyzed in very high-frequency range. Although MEG has been clinically used for two decades, it is not so widely-used as EEG. The lack of a powerful software platform is an important reason which hinders the development of MEG. A MEG-specific software, MEG processor, was released here. With the friendly graphical user interface (GUI) of MEG Processor, researcher can easily identify/mark HFOs and project the signal to MRI receiving a precise 3D reconstruction. We hope such a platform will help and encourage more clinicians to uncover the magnificent features of MEG.", "db": "ieee"}, {"title": "Synchronized position detection using two CCD cameras with one frame grabber for the 3D navigator", "abstract": "Recently, CAS (computer assisted surgery) has been used widely in the field of brain and spine surgery. In the CAS system, the real 3-D position of the surgical probe is overlapped with the patient's pre-acquired 3-D image.

In this research, the authors propose a new method using two camera system with one image grabber. Using this new method, simultaneous capture of a stereo image is possible by one frame grabber. So the authors can minimize errors due to time lag between images and further reduce costs. Left and right LEDs can be separated by a simple color processing algorithm on a PC. The authors are planning to separate three LEDs by applying further color information to each LED. This will offer faster calculation of the 3-D positions of the LEDs.

DBS is an accepted treatment for individuals living with Parkinson's Disease (PD). This surgery involves implantation of a permanent electrode inside the STN to deliver electrical current. Since the STN is a very small region inside the brain, accurate placement of an electrode is a challenging task for the surgical team. Prior to placement of the permanent electrode, microelectrode recordings of brain activity are used intraoperatively to localize the STN. The placement of the electrode and the success of the therapy depend on this location. In this paper, an objective approach is implemented to help the surgical team in localizing the STN. This is achieved by processing the MER signals and extracting features during the surgery to be used in a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm for defining the neurophysiological borders of the STN. For this purpose, a new classification approach is proposed with the goal of detecting both the dorsal and the ventral borders of the STN during the surgical procedure. Results collected from 100 PD patients in this study, show that by calculating and extracting wavelet transformation features from MER signals and using a data-driven computational deep neural network model, it is possible to detect the borders of the STN with an accuracy of 92%. The proposed method can be implemented in real-time during the surgery to model the neurophysiological nonlinearity along the path of the electrode trajectory during insertion.", "db": "ieee"}, {"title": "Accurate registration of various medical imaging modalities: an application to PET and MRI for anatomical localization and kinetic modelling", "abstract": "In order to help in analyzing PET data and to take advantage of their metabolic content, a system was designed and implemented to align and process data from various medical imaging modalities, particularly (but not only) for brain studies.

The probe is designed to be compact and electrically safe in order to be directly coupled to the excision tool leading to simultaneous detection and removal of tumor tissues. It is built with clear and plastic scintillating fibers held in a closed packed annular arrangement ensheathing the excision tool. The annihilation gamma ray background is eliminated by a real-time subtraction method. Validation of the technical choice and optimization of the probe geometry were performed by preliminary measurements and Monte Carlo simulations based on the MCNP-4C code and an anthropomorphic brain phantom. The theoretical probe sensitivity was found to be 82 cps/muCi/ml with a gamma ray rejection efficiency of 99.6%. The expected minimum radiotracer detectable concentration for tumors labeled with 18 F-FET was 0.10 muCi/ml.

CARS microscopy is a highly desirable tool to provide real-time information e.g. in brain-cancer surgery [1] due to its label-free chemical imaging capabilities of living tissue. Still a widespread use in real-world applications has not been achieved due to the lack of suitable laser sources. Today widely used CARS laser sources based on Ti:Sapphire and parametric frequency conversion in bulk crystals are expensive and large while their operation requires technical staff devoted to alignment and maintenance. This restricts the application of CARS microscopy to specialized research laboratories only.In this contribution an all-fiber, hence alignment-free, CARS laser source and its application to CARS microscopy is presented. Key components in our setup are a passively mode-locked fiber oscillator delivering nearly transform-limited 50ps pulses at an optimized repetition rate of 2MHz, a fiber integrated amplification system and a fiber optical parametric frequency conversion stage using degenerate four-wave-mixing (FWM) in an endlessly single-mode fiber [2]. In addition we present a seeded FWM CARS source with an extremely high spectral resolution. The cw seed enhances the resolution more than one order of magnitude and allows for distinguishing between CH2 and CH3 resonances. Due to the long pulse durations of the generated signal and pump pulses the temporal walk-off is negligible which makes them ideal for fiber delivery, e.g. to the microscope, without complex delay lines. This enhances the simplicity greatly and makes this source particularly easy to use. 2. Experiment and results The mode-locked 50ps all-fiber oscillator was optimized to run at 2 MHz to avoid photo damage and provide enough peak power for the CARS process (fig.1a). An Yb-doped single-clad fiber amplifier boosts the average power up to 0.5W. The active fiber is spliced to the conversion fiber with a transmission of 74%. A conversion to 798nm, corresponding to a frequency separation of 2845cm-1 was realized. All components are fusion spliced and polarization maintaining to obtain alignment-free and robust operation.Ultrahigh spectral resolution of 1cm-1 was realized by a seeded FWM scheme (Fig. 1b). A laser scanning microscope was used to scan at Raman shifts of 2850cm-1 and 2930cm-1 mapping lipid and protein in a human aorta sample with artheriosclerotic plaque deposition (Fig. 1c). In conclusion, a novel approach for an all-fiber mono-laser source for CARS microscopy is presented. The frequency conversion is optimized to access a frequency shift of around 2850cm-1. Cw-seeding enhances the resolution greatly. Inherently synchronized pump and Stokes pulses are available at one fiber end, readily overlapped in space and time. The source is applied to CARS spectroscopy and microscopy experiments in the CH-stretching band. Due to its simplicity and maintenance-free operation, the laser scheme holds great potential for bio-medical applications outside laser laboratories.", "db": "ieee"}, {"title": "Remote sessions and frequency analysis for improved insight into cerebral function during pediatric and neonatal intensive care", "abstract": "A project involving recording and analysing EEG together with cardiovascular signals and temperature has been initiated.

Remote sessions for joint interpretation have been carried out between pediatricians and clinical neurophysiologists, and EEG has been analyzed using frequency analyzing tools. One result is the discovery of reversible spectral changes coinciding with blood pressure falls, which may indicate loss of autoregulation function. This finding is one outcome from initial use of a system, developed during the project to facilitate communication about, and analysis of the recorded signals.

We demonstrate that a null-beamformer can be used to localise neural activity despite artefacts caused by the presence of DBS electrodes and stimulus pulses. We subsequently verified the accuracy of our source localisation by correlating the predicted DBS electrode positions with their actual positions, previously identified using anatomical imaging.

These MR brain images are often corrupted with Intensity Inhomogeneity artifact cause unwanted intensity variation due to non- uniformity in RF coils and Rician noise, the dominant noise in MRI due to thermal vibrations of electrons and ions and movement of objects during acquisition which may affect the performance of image processing techniques used for brain image analysis. Due to this type of artifact and noises, sometimes one type of normal tissue in MRI may be misclassified as other type of normal tissue and it leads to error during diagnosis. In this work, a method is proposed which automatically segments normal tissues such as White Matter, Gray Matter and Cerebrospinal Fluid from MR images with Rician noise and Intensity Inhomogeneity artifact. The proposed method consists of preprocessing using wrapping based curvelet transform to remove noise and Modified Spatial Fuzzy C Means segments normal tissues by considering spatial information because neighboring pixels are highly correlated and also construct initial membership matrix using initial cluster center by incorporating spatial neighborhood information to improve strength of clustering. This combination reduces Intensity Inhomogeneity artifact by providing higher segmentation accuracy.

The frequency-vs-depth map of LFP activity was extracted and further analyzed within different sub-bands, to investigate whether LFP activity can be used for STN border identification. STN borders identified by LFPs were compared to border predictions by the neurosurgeon, based on microelectrode-derived, single-unit recordings (MER-SUA). The results demonstrate difference between MER-SUA and macroelectrode LFP recording with respect to the dorsal STN border of -1.00 \u00b10.84 mm and -0.42 \u00b11.07 mm in the beta and gamma frequency bands, respectively. For these sub-bands, RMS of these distances was found to be 1.26 mm and 1.06 mm, respectively. Analysis of other sub-bands did not allow for distinguishing the caudal border of STN.

We have recently designed a novel method for the assessment of HIE after CA. The method is based on estimating the severity of the brain injury by analyzing changes in the electroencephalogram (EEG) slow wave activity while the patient is exposed to an anesthetic drug propofol in a controlled manner. In this paper, Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) was used to analyze EEG slow wave activity during anesthesia in ten post-CA patients. The recordings were made in the intensive care unit 36-48 hours after the CA in an experiment, during which the propofol infusion rate was incrementally decreased to determine the drug-induced changes in the EEG at different anesthetic levels. HHT was shown to successfully capture the changes in the slow wave activity to the behavior of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). While, in patients with good neurological outcome defined after a six-month control period, propofol induced a significant increase in the amplitude of IMFs representing the slow wave activity, the patients with poor neurological outcome were unable to produce such a response.

Owing to the individual difference in the sensory adaption of human smell function, the olfactory responses usually exhibit large inter-individual difference and change over time after repeated stimulations. The traditional analysis tools, such as statistical parametric mapping (SPM) in functional magnetic resonance imaging technique (fMRI) analysis, utilize the paradigm-based linear correlation and statistical techniques to discriminate the activation areas from background activities. However, these traditional approaches extract olfactory-induced responses using the stereotypic template or paradigm generated model. The olfactory-induced hemodynamic responses affected by internal/external events, such as changes of smell fatigue and attention, are not considered and therefore could result in misleading results. In this paper, owing to the stochastic characteristic of olfactory-induced responses, we adopted multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) to extract olfactory-induced hemodynamic responses in MRI blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signals. The MEMD is an efficient data-driven approach to extract nonlinear and non-stationary signals, which is an improved method to expand traditional empirical mode decomposition (EMD) from one channel to multi-channel processing. We applied MEMD to decompose time series of BOLD signals from each slice into multivariate intrinsic mode functions (IMF). The MEMD enables common features of different scales in an image slice to be arranged in distinct IMFs. Each IMF is an analytic, self-constructed, well-defined, and data-driven function with time-varying frequencies.

Computational-model validation", "abstract": "Epilepsy surgery still lacks an operational method for finding the epileptogenic zone (EZ) or the minimal amount of tissue that has to be resected in order to leave the patient seizure-free. Here we propose a method for predicting the result of a resection from data collected before the eventual resection, therefore allowing an optimal surgical planning. Our major hypothesis is that focal generalized epilepsies are caused by sub-systems with excessive afferent connectivity to and from the rest of the neuronal tissue. To address the issue of delineating the EZ before the actual resection, we propose a paradigm performing \"virtual surgery\" on the matrix of connectivity between local EEG measurements. The virtual resection removes not only the nodes covered by the suspected EZ and their connections but also subtracts the influence of these nodes on the rest of connectivity. The residual connectivity is then compared to the original one and a significant decrease indicate that the resection contains the EZ or at least large part of it. We tested this approach on a computational model of spatially distributed bi-stable units that provides a generic model of focal epileptic neuronal system. In the modelled cases of epileptic system with spreading seizures, we found that the removal of the EZ can be predicted by significant decrease of the residual connectivity after performing virtual resection. This decrease commensurate with the increase of the epileptic threshold (the ground truth) . The method also predicts the actual change of connectivity after removing the nodes from the model dynamics. In addition we tested our techniques against the \"na\u00efve\" virtual resection which is based on simply removing the corresponding nodes from the connectivity measure.

The low system complexity enables \u03bcOCT to be integrated onto surgical pick tip and utilized as an intraoperative diagnostic tool, while the high-resolution imaging capability of \u03bcOCT could help neurosurgeons identify the interfaces between glioma lesions and non-cancerous tissues fast and reliably, and thus, help neurosurgeons make appropriate treatment decisions.

These algorithms allow simulation of linear and nonlinear beam focusing through the skull as well as correction of aberrations induced by skull bones and inhomogeneity of the head.

In awake craniotomy, which is one of the advanced neurological surgery, surgeon performs direct electrical stimulation to patient's brain area during linguistic tasks(such as, naming objects or generating verbs) in order to detect brain functional areas.

The current gold standard for focus localization is from ictal (seizure) onset and thus requires the occurrence and recording of multiple typical seizures of a patient. Localization of the focus from seizure-free (interictal) periods remains a challenging problem, especially in the absence of interictal epileptiform activity. Methods: By exploring the concept of effective inflow, we developed a focus localization algorithm (FLA) based on directed connectivity between brain sites. Subsequently, using the measure of generalized partial directed coherence over a broad frequency band in FLA for the analysis of interictal periods from long-term (days) intracranial electroencephalographic signals, we identified the brain region that is the most frequent receiver of maximal effective inflow from other brain regions. Results: In six out of nine patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, the thus identified brain region was a statistically significant outlier (p <; 0.01) and coincided with the clinically assessed epileptogenic focus. In the remaining three patients, the clinically assessed focus still exhibited the highest inflow, but it was not deemed an outlier (p > 0.01). Conclusions: These findings suggest that the epileptogenic focus is a region of intense influence from other regions interictally, possibly as a mechanism to keep it under control in seizure-free periods.

This has been a difficult challenge and today no IR fiber has optical and mechanical properties even close to that of silica fiber. Nevertheless, the need for an IR fiber for medical CO/sub 2/ and Er:YAG lasers requires medical laser companies and clinicians to adopt often less than ideal IR fiber technologies. In this paper, the authors review the state-of-the-art in IR fibers for laser power delivery at 3 and 10.6 /spl mu/m. The best power delivery fibers for the CO/sub 2/ laser are hollow waveguides. Hollow sapphire fibers are currently used in gynecological, orthopedic, and neurosurgical applications. The authors have used the hollow sapphire in their neurosurgical studies on brain tissue to deliver over 25 W of CO/sup 2/ laser power to tissue. There are several fibers of choice for the Er:YAG laser. One type is the heavy-metal fluoride glass fiber and the other is solid sapphire fiber. Sapphire fibers are fabricated using either a laser-heated-pedesta1 growth (LHPG) or edge-defined, film fed growth (EFG) technique. The former has produced the lowest loss fiber to date but the EFG process developed by Saphikon Inc. has promise of producing low-loss fiber in long lengths. The best LHPG sapphire fiber has a loss less than 1 dB/m and may be made in diameters from 100 to 400 /spl mu/m. In power tests in their lab, the authors have delivered over 600 mJ of Er:YAG laser energy through a 50-cm long LHPG sapphire fiber.

The theoretical study enables us to determine the location and the amplitude of these lobes and to simulate the effect of the transmitted signal bandwidth. In particular, a simple analytical relation gives the intensity ratio between the grating lobes and the main lobe. This equation shows that this ratio is inversely proportional to the number of rings and to the bandwidth of the transmitted signal. A system was developed and tested with two transducer arrays of 35- and 150-mm diameter, respectively. The simulations and experiments demonstrate the validity of the theoretical study and the efficacy of the proposed procedure. In conclusion, it is possible to reduce the grating lobes without geometric modification of the array by increasing the bandwidth of the transmitted signal.", "db": "ieee"}, {"title": "Patient-specific spectrum power determination for source localization of ictal MEG", "abstract": "Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be a useful diagnostic tool for presurgical evaluation of pediatric medically intractable partial epilepsy.

We investigated whether frequency-dependent ictal MEG onset source localization further improves results of interictal MEG in defining the SOZ. Source localization analyses were applied using multiple algorithms, both at the beginning of ictal onset and for interictal MEG discharges. Ictal MEG onsets were identified by visual inspection and power spectrum using short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Source localizations were compared with ICEEG, surgical procedure and outcome. Eight patients were included in this study. Five of the 8 patients (63%) had concordant ictal MEG onset source localization and interictal MEG discharge source localizations in the same lobe, but the source of ictal MEG onset was closer to the SOZ defined by ICEEG.

Then, we selected a random EEG signal from each rhythm as a reference and performed cross wavelet transform (XWT) of the rest of the EEG rhythms with their respective chosen reference rhythms to examine their nature of correlation in both time scale and time-frequency frame. Finally, the obtained cross-rhythm spectrum time-frequency image plots were fed to a customized CNN model for the purpose of automated feature extraction and classification of EEG signals. The performance of the proposed CNN model was also compared with two pre-trained benchmark CNN models namely AlexNet and VGGNet16, respectively. We observed that the proposed EEG signal classification framework has delivered 100% accuracy for the delta ( $\\delta$ ) rhythm and that too at a significantly reduced training time compared to the existing state-of-the-art CNN models.

Signs of autonomic activity are not very accurate; hence, an alternative technique is required to monitor the depth of anaesthesia. In common with many biological systems, brain activity is a dynamical system having irregular and unpredictable characteristics. The mathematical analysis of the behaviour of dynamical systems has expanded rapidly with the advent of fast computers. This has given rise to a wide range of medical applications, including mathematical analysis of the human EEG. It is in this last genre that the automatic assessment of the depth of anaesthesia, using ongoing EEG as a measure of brain activity, is discussed. One of the most important problems in EEG analysis is the extraction of appropriate features to describe the ongoing signal, and this can be tackled in various ways. The feature extraction stage of the work described in this paper was performed using methods of dynamic systems analysis and involved the extraction of stochastic and dynamic complexity features of the signal. Feature-spaces formed using these two methods were used as input to a radial basis function pattern classifier.

While Micro-electrode Recording (MER) provides adjunctive information to guidance assisted by pre-operative imaging, it is not unanimously used in the operating room. The lack of standard use of MER may be in part due to its long duration, which can lead to complications during the operation, or due to high degree of expertise required for their interpretation. Over the past decade, various approaches addressing automating MER analysis for target localization have been proposed, which have mainly focused on feature engineering. While the accuracies obtained are acceptable in certain configurations, one issue with handcrafted MER features is that they do not necessarily capture more subtle differences in MER that could be detected auditorily by an expert neurophysiologist.

Therefore, it puts forward a necessity to explore a scheme that could both collect high-quality EEG signals and guarantee high-level operation safety.This study proposed a Minimally Invasive Local-skull Electrophysiological Modification method to improve scalp EEG signals qualities at specific brain regions. Six eight-month-old SD rats were used for in vivo verification experiment. A hole with a diameter of about 500 micrometers was drilled in the skull above the visual cortex of rats.

After modification, the skull impedance of rats decreases by about 84 %, the average maximum bandwidth of rsEEG increase by 57 %, and the broadband SNR of SSVEP is increased by 5.13 dB. The time of piezoelectric drilling operation is strictly controlled under 30 seconds for each rat to prevent possible brain damage from overheating. Compared with traditional invasive procedures such as ECoG, Minimally Invasive Local-skull Electrophysiological Modification operation time is shorter and no electrode implantation is needed while it remarkably boosts the scalp EEG signal quality.

Performance is assessed with test parameters including: measurement noise, electrode placement errors, contact impedance errors, deviations in assumed tissue conductivity, deviations in assumed anatomy, and a frequency-dependent background. A final test is performed using ischemic patient data. Results are assessed using images and quantitative metrics. Results: BFSD-EIT may be feasible for stroke diagnosis if a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of \u226560 dB is achievable. Sensitivity to errors in electrode positioning is seen with a tolerance of only \u00b15 mm, but a tolerance of up to \u00b130 mm is possible if symmetry is maintained between symmetrically opposite partner electrodes. The technique is robust to errors in contact impedance and assumed tissue conductivity up to at least \u00b150%.

This promising treatment modality requires high energy resulting eventually in undesired cavitation and potential side effects. The goals of the present work were: 1) to evaluate the potential increase of the cavitation threshold using pseudorandom gated sonications and 2) to assess the heating capabilities with such sonications. The experiments were performed with the transcranial magnetic resonance (MR)-compatible ExAblate Neuro system (InSightec, Haifa, Israel) operating at a frequency of 670 kHz, either in continuous wave (CW) or with pseudorandom gated sonications of 50% duty cycle. Cavitation activity with the two types of sonications was compared using chemical dosimetry of hydroxyl radical production at the focus of the transducer, after propagation in water or through a human skull. Heating trials were performed in a hydrogel tissue-mimicking material embedded in a human skull to mimic a clinical situation. The temperature was measured by MR-thermometry when focusing at the geometrical focus and steering off focus up to 15 mm. Compared with CW sonications, the use of gated sonication did not affect the efficiency (60%) nor the steering abilities of the transducer. After propagation through a human skull, gated sonication required a higher pressure level (10 MPa) to initiate cavitation as compared with CW (5.8 MPa). Moreover, at equivalent acoustic power above the cavitation threshold, the level of cavitation activity initiated with gated sonications was much lower with gated sonication than with continuous sonications, almost half after propagation through water and one-third after propagation through a skull. This lowered cavitation activity may be attributed to a breaking of the dynamic of the bubbles moving from monochromatic to more broadband sonications and to the removal of residual cavitation nuclei between pulses with gated sonications. The heating capability was not affected by the gated sonications, and similar temperature increases were reached at focus with both types of sonications when sonicating at equivalent acoustic power, both in water or after propagation through a human skull (+15 \u00b0C at 325 W for 10 s).

The noise estimation scheme, adaptive threshold levels, rearranging, and multilevel denoising of frames increase the accuracy and signal to noise ratio of the extracted cycles. The modified fuzzy c-means clustering scheme, proposed to improve clustering performance in noisy data bases where no prior information about the level of noise and signal energy is available, is used for clustering the auditory steady-state cycles.

Mean contact durations and mean pressure-time integrals were also significantly increased at these plantar locations following foot surgery. This redistribution in pressure metrics suggests the formation of new lateral planter weight bearing areas.

A micro-bubble is configured at the tip of the fiber to form an F-P cavity that is sensitive to pressure. A loose optical fiber inscribed with an FBG element is cascaded with the F-P cavity leading to temperature compensation for the designed sensor. The sensing theoretical model has been derived and combined with the finite element method (FEM) simulation the sensor structure has been determined as well. Fabrication processing of the designed sensor has been optimized and explored by experiments. Calibration experiment results indicate that the pressure sensitivity of the designed sensor is 8.93 pm/kPa, which is consistent with the simulated value. The temperature coupled error is less than 3.89% leading to a capability for temperature self-compensation. Several heart-vascular simulation experiments have been carried out to investigate the dynamic performance of the designed sensor, which shows the measured pressure errors within this confidence interval of [-2.56%, 2.54%] correspond to high confidence of 0.95.

In medical practice, the localization of the epileptogenic area or region in the brain is the primary task for the effectiveness of the epilepsy surgery. The epileptogenic region is identified based on the presence of focal electroencephalogram (EEG) signals during recording. Therefore, the classification of focal (FL) and non-focal (NFL) classes of EEG channels is the prerequisite to identify the epileptogenic regions in the brain. In this paper, a hybrid approach based on the combination of the band or rhythm specific Fourier-Bessel series expansion domain empirical wavelet transform (FBSE-EWT) filter bank and sparse autoencoder (SAE) based support vector machine (SAE-SVM) network is proposed for the categorization of FL and NFL types of EEG channels. The rhythms such as \u03b4, \u03b8, \u03b1, \u03b2, and y are obtained from the EEG signal of each channel using FBSE-EWT filter bank. The SAE-SVM network classifies the FL and NFL categories of EEG channels directly from the rhythms. The results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid approach has 100% accuracy for the classification of FL and NFL types using the \u03b4-rhythms of EEG signals for both channels.

Seventy-seven female patients, scheduled for ambulatory gynecologic surgical procedures under general anesthesia, were included. EEG segments of 45s, preceding tetanic stimulation, were split into epochs of 5s with no overlapping.

Five different machine learning (ML) models were tested: 1D CNN model for raw EEG signal, random forest classifier, XGBoost classifier and support vector classifier for extracted features and finally 2D CNN model for CWT scalogram. The results showed that the performance of the proposed ML models to predict movement to standardized tetanic stimulation through the EEG signal was almost equal to the performance of commercially available indices (AUC=0.73).

Many algorithms have been proposed for the automatic detection of epileptic seizures using traditional machine learning and deep learning. Although deep learning methods have achieved great success in many fields, their performance in EEG analysis and classification is still limited mainly due to the relatively small sizes of available datasets. In this paper, we propose an automatic method for the detection of epileptic seizures based on deep metric learning which is a novel strategy tackling the few-shot problem by mitigating the demand for massive data. First, two one-dimensional convolutional embedding modules are proposed as a deep feature extractor, for single-channel and multichannel EEG signals respectively. Then, a deep metric learning model is detailed along with a stage-wise training strategy. Experiments are conducted on the publicly-available Bonn University dataset which is a benchmark dataset, and the CHB-MIT dataset which is larger and more realistic. Impressive averaged accuracy of 98.60% and specificity of 100% are achieved on the most difficult classification of interictal (subset D) vs ictal (subset E) of the Bonn dataset.

Diagnostic procedures for epilepsy and monitoring are highly specialized and labour-intensive. The accuracy of the diagnosis is also complicated by overlapping medical symptoms, varying levels of experience and inter-observer variability among clinical professions. This paper proposes a novel hybrid bilinear deep learning network with an application in the clinical procedures of epilepsy classification diagnosis, where the use of surface electroencephalogram (sEEG) and audiovisual monitoring is standard practice. Hybrid bilinear models based on two types of feature extractors, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), are trained using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) of one-second sEEG. In the proposed hybrid models, CNNs extract spatio-temporal patterns, while RNNs focus on the characteristics of temporal dynamics in relatively longer intervals given the same input data. Second-order features, based on interactions between these spatio-temporal features are further explored by bilinear pooling and used for epilepsy classification.

These recordings are a window to understanding how the human brain processes information and subsequently behaves in healthy and pathologic states. Here, we describe and implement delay differential analysis (DDA) for the characterization of ECoG data obtained from human patients with intractable epilepsy. DDA is a time-domain analysis framework based on embedding theory in nonlinear dynamics that reveals the nonlinear invariant properties of an unknown dynamical system. The DDA embedding serves as a low-dimensional nonlinear dynamical basis onto which the data are mapped. This greatly reduces the risk of overfitting and improves the method's ability to fit classes of data. Since the basis is built on the dynamical structure of the data, preprocessing of the data (e.g., filtering) is not necessary. We performed a large-scale search for a DDA model that best fit ECoG recordings using a genetic algorithm to qualitatively discriminate between different cortical states and epileptic events for a set of 13 patients. A single DDA model with only three polynomial terms was identified. Singular value decomposition across the feature space of the model revealed both global and local dynamics that could differentiate electrographic and electroclinical seizures and provided insights into highly localized seizure onsets and diffuse seizure terminations. Other common ECoG features such as interictal periods, artifacts, and exogenous stimuli were also analyzed with DDA.
