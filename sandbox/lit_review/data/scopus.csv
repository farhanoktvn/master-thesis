Scaffolding cells in hydrogels is known to protect cells from such immediate death by shielding them from mechanical damage and by averting an immune attack after transplantation. Implanted hydrogels must eventually degrade and facilitate a safe integration of the graft with the surrounding host tissue. Hence, serial monitoring of hydrogel degradation in vivo is pivotal to optimize hydrogel compositions and overall therapeutic efficacy of the graft. We present here methods and protocols to use chemical exchange saturation transfer magnetic resonance imaging (CEST MRI) as a non-invasive, label-free imaging paradigm to monitor the degradation of composite hydrogels made up of thiolated gelatin (Gel-SH), thiolated hyaluronic acid (HA-SH), and poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA), of which the stiffness and CEST contrast can be fine-tuned by simply varying the composite concentrations and mixing ratios. By individually labeling Gel-S and HA-S with two distinct near-infrared (NIR) dyes, multispectral monitoring of the relative degradation of the components can be used for long-term validation of the CEST MRI findings. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Humana Press Inc.","Book chapter","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Reducing these invasive procedures that are associated with considerable morbidity, requires better preoperative detection. Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is a rapidly evolving imaging technique that may improve preoperative detection of (early-stage) lymph node metastases, enabling the identification of molecular changes that often precede structural changes in tumorigenesis. Here, we characterize the optoacoustic properties of cetuximab-800CW, a tumor-specific fluorescent tracer showing several photophysical properties that benefit optoacoustic signal generation. In this first clinical proof-of-concept study, we explore its use as optoacoustic to differentiate between malignant and benign lymph nodes. We characterize the appearance of malignant lymph nodes and show differences in the distribution of intrinsic chromophores compared to benign lymph nodes. In addition, we suggest several approaches to improve the efficiency of follow-up studies. © 2022 The Authors","Elsevier GmbH","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, it is difficult to accurately determine the actual Breslow depth before surgery using the existing ocular micrometer and biopsy technique. Objectives: To evaluate the use of 3D wide-field multispectral photoacoustic imaging to non-invasively measure depth and outline the boundary of melanomas for optimal surgical margin selection. Methods: Six melanoma patients were examined in vivo using the 3D multispectral photoacoustic imaging system. For five cases of melanomas (one in situ, three nodular, and one acral lentiginous type melanoma), the spectrally unmixed photoacoustic depths were calculated and compared against histopathological depths. Results: Spectrally unmixed photoacoustic depths and histopathological depths match well within a mean absolute error of 0.36 mm. In particular, the measured minimum and maximum depths in the in situ and nodular type of melanoma were 0.6 and 9.1 mm, respectively. In the 3D photoacoustic image of one metastatic melanoma, feeding vessels were visualized in the melanoma, suggesting the neovascularization around the tumour. Conclusions: The 3D multispectral photoacoustic imaging not only provides well-measured depth and sizes of various types of melanomas, it also visualizes the metastatic type of melanoma. Obtaining accurate depth and boundary information of melanoma before surgery would play a useful role in the complete excision of melanoma during surgery. © 2020 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology","John Wiley and Sons Inc","Article","","Scopus"

Especially immune modulating therapies with moderate response rates urge for biomarkers and/or assays to determine individual prediction of treatment response and investigate resistance mechanisms. Here, we describe a standardized ex vivo tissue culture model to investigate individual tumor responses. NSCLC tissue cultures preserve morphological characteristics of the baseline tumor specimen for up to 12 days ex vivo and also maintain T-cell function for up to 10 days ex vivo. A semi-automated analysis of proliferating and apoptotic tumor cells was used to evaluate tissue responses to the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (n = 12), from which two cases could be successfully correlated to the clinical outcome. T-cell responses upon nivolumab treatment were investigated by flow cytometry and multispectral imaging. Alterations in the frequency of the Treg population and reorganization of tumor tissues could be correlated to nivolumab responsiveness ex vivo. Thus, our findings not only demonstrate the functionality of T cells in NSCLC slice cultures up to 10 days ex vivo, but also suggests this model for stratifying patients for treatment selection and to investigate in depth the tumor-associated T-cell regulation. © 2021, The Author(s).","Springer Nature","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

COVID-19 vaccines cause benign hypermetabolic lymphadenopathies. Clinical stratification between vaccine-associated benign lymphadenopathies and malignant lymphadenopathies through ultrasound, MRI or FDG PET-CT is not feasible. This leads to unnecessary lymph node biopsies, excisions and even radical lymph node dissections. Therefore, to avoid unnecessary surgeries, we assessed whether noninvasive multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) enables a better differentiation between benign and malignant lymphadenopathies. Patients and Methods: All patients were vaccinated for COVID-19. We used MSOT to image deoxy- and oxyhaemoglobin levels in lymph nodes of tumour patients to assess metastatic status. MSOT imaging results were compared with standard ultrasound and pathological lymph node analysis. We also evaluated the influences of gender, age and time between vaccination and MSOT measurement of lymph nodes on the measured deoxy- and oxyhaemoglobin levels in patients with reactive lymph node changes. Results: Multispectral optoacoustic tomography was able to identify cancer-free lymph nodes in vivo without a single false negative (33 total lymph nodes), with 100% sensitivity and 50% specificity. A statistically significant higher deoxyhaemoglobin content was detected in patients with tumour manifestations in the lymph node (p = 0.02). There was no statistically significant difference concerning oxyhaemoglobin (p = 0.65). Age, sex and time between vaccination and MSOT measurement had statistically non-significant impact on deoxy- and oxyhaemoglobin levels in patients with reactive lymph nodes. Conclusion: Here, we show that MSOT measurement is an advantageous clinical approach to differentiate between vaccine-associated benign lymphadenopathy and malignant lymph node metastases based on the deoxygenation level in lymph nodes. © 2023 The Authors.

Its use has been limited to open surgery due to large camera sizes, missing color video, or long acquisition times. A hand-held, laparoscopic hyperspectral camera has been developed now to overcome those disadvantages and evaluated clinically for the first time. Methods: In a clinical evaluation study, gastrointestinal resectates of ten cancer patients were investigated using the laparoscopic hyperspectral camera. Reference data from corresponding anatomical regions were acquired with a clinically approved HSI system. An image registration process was executed that allowed for pixel-wise comparisons of spectral data and parameter images (StO2: oxygen saturation of tissue, NIR PI: near-infrared perfusion index, OHI: organ hemoglobin index, TWI: tissue water index) provided by both camera systems. The mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) served for the quantitative evaluations. Spearman’s rank correlation between factors related to the study design like the time of spectral white balancing and MAE, respectively RMSE, was calculated. Results: The obtained mean MAEs between the TIVITA® Tissue and the laparoscopic hyperspectral system resulted in StO2: 11% ± 7%, NIR PI: 14±3, OHI: 14± 5, and TWI: 10 ± 2. The mean RMSE between both systems was 0.1±0.03 from 500 to 750 nm and 0.15 ±0.06 from 750 to 1000 nm. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients showed no significant correlation between MAE or RMSE and influencing factors related to the study design. Conclusion: Qualitatively, parameter images of the laparoscopic system corresponded to those of the system for open surgery. Quantitative deviations were attributed to technical differences rather than the study design. Limitations of the presented study are addressed in current large-scale in vivo trials. © 2022, The Author(s).","Springer","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Across species, strategies for stochastic multicolour labelling have greatly facilitated in vivo cell tracking and mapping neuronal connectivity. Yet integrating multi-fluorophore information into the context of developing zebrafish tissues is challenging given their cytoplasmic localization and spectral incompatibility with common fluorescent markers. Inspired by Drosophila Raeppli, we developed FRaeppli (Fish-Raeppli) by expressing bright membrane- or nuclear-targeted fluorescent proteins for efficient cell shape analysis and tracking. High spatiotemporal activation flexibility is provided by the Gal4/UAS system together with Cre/lox and/or PhiC31 integrase. The distinct spectra of the FRaeppli fluorescent proteins allow simultaneous imaging with GFP and infrared subcellular reporters or tissue landmarks. We demonstrate the suitability of FRaeppli for live imaging of complex internal organs, such as the liver, and have tailored hyperspectral protocols for time-efficient acquisition. Combining FRaeppli with polarity markers revealed previously unknown canalicular topologies between differentiating hepatocytes, reminiscent of the mammalian liver, suggesting common developmental mechanisms. The multispectral FRaeppli toolbox thus enables the comprehensive analysis of intricate cellular morphologies, topologies and lineages at single-cell resolution in zebrafish. © 2022.

Combined use of complementary fluorescent emissions can allow visualization of different anatomical structures (e.g. tumor, lymphatics and nerves) in the same patient. With the aim to assess the requirements for multi-color fluorescence guidance under in vivo conditions, we thoroughly characterized two FDA-approved laparoscopic Firefly camera systems available on the da Vinci Si or da Vinci Xi surgical robot. In this process, we studied the cameras’ performance with respect to the photophysical properties of the FDA-approved dyes Fluorescein and ICG. Our findings indicate that multi-wavelength fluorescence imaging of Fluorescein and ICG is possible using clinical-grade fluorescence laparoscopes, but critical factors for success include the photophysical dye properties, imaging system performance and the amount of accumulated dye. When comparing the camera performance, the Xi system provided more effective excitation (adaptions in the light source) and higher detection sensitivity (chip-on-a-tip and/or enhanced image processing) for both Fluorescein and ICG. Both systems can readily be used for multi-wavelength fluorescence imaging of Fluorescein and ICG under clinically relevant conditions.

Material and methods: For the experiments, freshly bisected kidneys of alpha 8 integrin knock-out (KO) and wildtype mice (WT) were used. A total of n=7 female (n=4 KO, n=3 WT) and n=6 male animals (n=2 KO, n=4 WT) aged 6 weeks were examined with RSOM optoacoustic imaging systems (RSOM Explorer P50 at SWL 532nm and/or ms-P50 imaging system at 532 nm, 555 nm, 579 nm, and 606 nm). Images were reconstructed using a dedicated software, analyzed for size and vascular area and compared to standard histologic sections. Results: RSOM enabled mapping of murine kidney size and vascular area, revealing differences between kidney sizes of male (m) and female (f) mice (merged frequencies (MF) f vs. m: 52.42±6.24 mm2 vs. 69.18±15.96 mm2, p=0.0156) and absolute vascular area (MF f vs. m: 35.67±4.22 mm2 vs. 49.07±13.48 mm2, p=0.0036). Without respect to sex, the absolute kidney area was found to be smaller in knock-out (KO) than in wildtype (WT) mice (WT vs. KO: MF: p=0.0255) and showed a similar trend for the relative vessel area (WT vs. KO: MF p=0.0031). Also the absolute vessel areas of KO compared to WT were found significantly different (MF p=0.0089). A significant decrease in absolute vessel area was found in KO compared to WT male mice (MF WT vs. KO: 54.37±9.35 mm2 vs. 34.93±13.82 mm2, p=0.0232). In addition, multispectral RSOM allowed visualization of oxygenated and deoxygenated parenchymal regions by spectral unmixing. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the capability of RSOM for label-free visualization of differences in vascular morphology in ex vivo murine renal tissue at high resolution. Due to its scalability optoacoustic imaging provides an emerging modality with potential for further preclinical and clinical imaging applications. © 2022, The Author(s).","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

During spinal surgery, such as scoliosis correction, this structure can be damaged, resulting in major neurological damage to the patient. To date, there is no direct way to monitor the oxygenation of the spinal cord intraoperatively to reflect its vitality. This is essential information that would allow surgeons to adapt their procedure in case of ischemic suffering of the spinal cord. We report the development of a specific device to monitor the functional status of biological tissues with high resolution. The device, operating with multiple wavelengths, uses Near-InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS) in combination with other additional sensors, including ElectroNeuroGraphy (ENG). In this paper, we focused primarily on aspects of the PhotoPlethysmoGram (PPG), emanating from four different light sources to show in real time and record biological signals from the spinal cord in transmission and reflection modes.

The significant captured data in HSI can be useful for classifying different types of brain tissues, since they gather reflectance values from different band widths below and beyond the visual spectrum. This allows ML algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) to classify brain tissues such as tumors. Predicted results can be used to create visualizations and support neurosurgeons before injuring any tissue. This way neurosurgeons can be more precise, reducing any possible damages on healthy tissues. In this work, a proposal for the classification of in-vivo brain hyperspectral images using SVM and RF classifiers is presented. A total of four hyperspectral images from four different patients with glioblastoma grade IV (GBM) brain tumor have been selected to train models and, therefore, classify them. Five different classes have been defined during experiments: healthy tissue, tumor, venous blood vessel, arterial blood vessel and dura mater. Results obtained suggest that SVM usually performs better than RF, generally achieving up to 97% of mean accuracy (ACC). However, RF performance had better results than SVM when classifying images used during training, obtaining almost 100% of mean ACC for all 5 classes described. This study shows the robustness of SVM and the potential of RF for real-time brain cancer detection. © 2020 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Conference paper","","Scopus"

In this study, CDK4/6-dependent and -resistant models were employed to identify functional determinants of response to pharmacologic CDK4/6 inhibitors. In all models tested, the activation of RB and inhibition of CDK2 activity emerged as determinants of sensitivity. While depleting CDK4 and 6 was sufficient to limit proliferation in specific resistance settings, RB loss rendered cells completely independent of these kinases. The main downstream target in this context was the activation status of CDK2, which was suppressed with CDK4/6 inhibition in an RB-dependent fashion. Protein levels of p27 were associated with plasticity/rigidity of the cell cycle and correlated with sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibition. Exogenous overexpression and pharmacologic induction of p27 via inhibition of SKP2 and targeting the MEK/ERK pathway enhanced the cytostatic effect of CDK4/6 inhibitors. Mice bearing ERþ xenografts displayed a durable antitumor response to palbociclib; however, over the course of treatment, few cells retained RB phosphorylation, which was associated with limited p27 protein levels as determined by multispectral imaging. Similarly, combination treatment of palbociclib with a MEK inhibitor in pancreatic cancer PDX models upregulated p27 and further enhanced the in vivo tumor response to palbociclib. Collectively, these results suggest that the cell cycle plasticity, which enables tumor models to evade palbociclib-mediated activation of RB, could be targeted using a clinically applicable CDK2 inhibitor. Significance: This work provides a mechanistic insight toward understanding the functional roles of multiple cell cycle regulators that drive plasticity and sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibition. ©2020 American Association for Cancer Research.","American Association for Cancer Research Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In this work, the potential of a portable, dual-mode multispectral LED-based photoacoustic and ultrasound system (AcousticX) in breast imaging is investigated for the first time. The AcousticX system comprises a linear array ultrasound probe (7 MHz) and two dualwavelength LED arrays (750/850 nm) placed on both sides of the probe. Two experiments were performed to investigate the potential of the system in imaging the breast. In the first instance, interleaved photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging was performed on a semi-anthropomorphic multi-layered 3D breast phantom with possibility to tune oxygen saturation in blood vessel structures. In the second experiment, vasculature of a healthy human breast was imaged in vivo. Skin and multiple vascular features along with its relative oxygen saturation are visualized using photoacoustic imaging and the ultrasound images offered valuable structural information including fat, fibroglandular tissue and pectoral muscles. In human in vivo experiments, we achieved an imaging depth of around 1.7 cm at a display frame rate of 10 Hz, the highest in vivo imaging depth reported in LED-based photoacoustic imaging using a 7 MHz probe. With the capability of providing real-time structural and functional information, AcousticX holds clinical translation potential in non-invasive breast imaging. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Herein, we overcame this barrier by designing orally ingestible probiotic vectors for ‘hitchhiking’ ultrasmall hafnia (HfO2) (∼1-2 nm) nanoparticles. The minute-made synthesis of these nanoparticles is accomplished through a simple reduction reaction. These nanoparticles were incubated with probiotic bacteria with potential health benefits and were non-specifically taken up due to their small size. Subsequently, the bacteria were lyophilized and packed into a capsule to be administered orally as the radiopaque contrast agents for delineating the GI features. These nano-bio-hybrid entities could successfully be utilized as contrast agents in vivo in the conventional and multispectral computed tomography (CT). We demonstrated in ‘color’ the accumulated nanoparticles using advanced detectors of the photon counting CT.

Stem cell-derived organoids follow a time course similar to species-specific organ gestation in vivo. However, heterogeneous tissue yields, and subjective tissue selection reduce the repeatability of organoid-based scientific experiments and clinical studies. To improve the quality control of organoids, we introduced a live imaging technique based on two-photon microscopy to non-invasively monitor and characterize retinal organoids’ (RtOgs’) long-term development. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) was used to monitor the metabolic trajectory, and hyperspectral imaging was applied to characterize structural and molecular changes. We further validated the live imaging experimental results with endpoint biological tests, including quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), single-cell RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemistry. With FLIM results, we analyzed the free/bound nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (f/b NADH) ratio of the imaged regions and found that there was a metabolic shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation. This shift occurred between the second and third months of differentiation. The total metabolic activity shifted slightly back toward glycolysis between the third and fourth months and stayed relatively stable between the fourth and sixth months. Consistency in organoid development among cell lines and production lots was examined. Molecular analysis showed that retinal progenitor genes were expressed in all groups between days 51 and 159. Photoreceptor gene expression emerged around the second month of differentiation, which corresponded to the shift in the f/b NADH ratio. RtOgs between 3 and 6 months of differentiation exhibited photoreceptor gene expression levels that were between the native human fetal and adult retina gene expression levels. The occurrence of cone opsin expression (OPN1 SW and OPN1 LW) indicated the maturation of photoreceptors in the fourth month of differentiation, which was consistent with the stabilized level of f/b NADH ratio starting from 4 months. Endpoint single-cell RNA and immunohistology data showed that the cellular compositions and lamination of RtOgs at different developmental stages followed those in vivo.

Objective: Using HSI valuable intraoperative information can be obtained in order to make colorectal interventions more efficient and safer through tissue analyses (e.g. differentiation of pathological and normal tissue, depiction of the nerve plexus in the true pelvis as well as the ureter). In order to make a better interpretation of this hyperspectral information, current methods of AI are used. In this article, the latest intraoperative methods in the context of colorectal resection are presented and critically discussed. Material and method: For this purpose, a summary of current work on the combination of HSI with AI methods is presented. These studies deal with the intraoperative tissue classification of neoplastic vs. non-neoplastic lesions and the identification of risk structures in colorectal surgery. Results: In more recent papers, a successful differentiation of colorectal carcinomas from dysplastic and normal mucosa as well as the recognition of risk structures with an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of >90% could be achieved. These involve in vivo and ex vivo studies using various AI algorithms. Conclusion: Initial studies showed the versatile possibilities of HSI in combination with AI in colorectal surgery. In future studies, based on larger amounts of data, the practicability, stability and accuracy of the AI methods will be further investigated. In addition, HSI technology must be further developed and also implemented in endoscopic diagnostics in order to use its great potential not only in colorectal resection but also in colonoscopy for many other patients. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.","Springer Medizin","Review","","Scopus"

The multispectral Interlaced Sparse Sampling PAT, or ISS-PAT, is a previously proposed PAT imaging method that offered high quality images with much sparser transducer angular coverage. Although it provides superior imaging performance, the original ISS-PAT method suffered from a heavy computation burden, which hinders its practical application. Methods: Here, we propose a new regularization scheme based on the directional total variation (dTV) for ISS-PAT. This method efficiently imposes the structural information by considering both the edge position and direction information of the anatomical prior image in ISS-PAT. It does not require image segmentation, and can be conveniently solved by a modified alternating direction of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. Results: We perform simulation, tissue mimicking phantom and in vivo small animal experiments to evaluate the proposed scheme. The reconstructed PAT images showed image quality and spectral un-mixing accuracy close to those obtained by non-local means based ISS-PAT, but with much shorter image reconstruction time. For a 1/6 sparse sampling rate, the average efficiency improvement is nearly 16-folds. Conclusions: The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the dTV regularization scheme for ISS-PAT. Its efficient image reconstruction performance facilitates the potential of the hardware realization and practical applications of the ISS-PAT. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Article","","Scopus"

It has the distinct advantage of being noncontact, nonionizing, and noninvasive without the need for a contrast agent. Among the many applications of HSI in the medical field are the detection of various types of tumors and the evaluation of their blood flow, as well as the healing processes of grafts and wounds. Since tumor perfusion is one of the critical factors in oncology, we assessed the value of HSI in quantifying perfusion changes during interventions in clinical oncology through a systematic review of the literature. Materials and methods: The PubMed and Web of Science electronic databases were searched using the terms ""hyperspectral imaging perfusion cancer""and ""hyperspectral imaging resection cancer"". The inclusion criterion was the use of HSI in clinical oncology, meaning that all animal, phantom, ex vivo, experimental, research and development, and purely methodological studies were excluded. Results: Twenty articles met the inclusion criteria. The anatomic locations of the neoplasms in the selected articles were as follows: kidneys (1 article), breasts (2 articles), eye (1 article), brain (4 articles), entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract (1 article), upper GI tract (5 articles), and lower GI tract (6 articles). Conclusions: HSI is a potentially attractive imaging modality for clinical application in oncology, with assessment of mastectomy skin flap perfusion after reconstructive breast surgery and anastomotic perfusion during reconstruction of gastrointenstinal conduit as the most promising at present.  © 2022 Rok Hren, Gregor Sersa, Urban Simoncic, Matija Milanic, published by Sciendo.","Sciendo","Review","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, the real-time application of this technique in interventional medicine can be challenging due to the long acquisition times needed for large amounts of hyperspectral data with hundreds of bands. While this challenge can partially be addressed by choosing a discriminative subset of bands, the band selection methods proposed to date are mainly restricted by the availability of often hard to obtain reference measurements. We address this bottleneck with a new approach to band selection that leverages highly accurate Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. We hypothesize that a so chosen small subset of bands can reproduce or even improve upon the results of a quasi continuous spectral measurement. We further investigate whether novel domain adaptation techniques can address the inevitable domain shift stemming from the use of simulations. Initial results based on in silico and in vivo experiments suggest that 10-20 bands are sufficient to closely reproduce results from spectral measurements with 101 bands in the 500-700 nm range. The investigated domain adaptation technique, which only requires unlabeled in vivo measurements, yielded better results than the pure in silico band selection method. Overall, our method could guide development of fast multispectral imaging systems suited for interventional use without relying on complex hardware setups or manually labeled data. © 2022 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.","The Optical Society","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

One explanation may be differences in blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity compared to high-grade glioma. The authors hypothesized that for a BBB semipermeable to 5-ALA there might be a relationship between plasma 5-ALA concentration and its movement into the brain. A higher dose would elicit more 5-ALA conversion into protoporphyrin IX (PPIX). The authors present a case series of patients harboring LGG who received higher doses of 5-ALA. METHODS Patients undergoing surgery for indeterminate glioma later diagnosed as LGG were included in this study. 5-ALA was administered at a standard dose of 20 mg/kg body weight (bw) 4 hours prior to induction of anesthesia. A subgroup of patients received a higher dose of 40 mg/kg bw. Fluorescence was evaluated visually and PPIX concentration (cPPIX) was determined ex vivo by hyperspectral measurements in freshly extracted tissue. All adverse events were recorded. RESULTS A total of 23 patients harboring diffuse low-grade astrocytomas (n = 19) and oligodendrogliomas (n = 4) were analyzed. Thirteen patients received 20 mg/kg bw, and 10 patients received 40 mg/kg bw of 5-ALA. In the 20 mg/kg group, 30.8% (4 of 13) of tumors harbored areas of visible fluorescence, compared to 60% of cases (n = 6 of 10) with 40 mg/kg bw. The threshold to visibility was 1 μg/ml in both groups. Measured over all biopsies, the mean cPPIX was significantly higher in the double-dose group (1.8 vs 0.45 μg/ml; p < 0.001). In non-visibly fluorescent tissue the mean cPPIX was 0.146 μg/ml in the 20 mg/kg and 0.347 μg/ml in the 40 mg/kg group, indicating an increase of 138% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS These observations demonstrate different regions with different levels of PPIX accumulation in LGG. With higher 5-ALA doses cPPIX increases, leading to more regions surpassing the visibility threshold of 1 μg/ml. These observations can be explained by the fact that the BBB in LGG is semipermeable to 5-ALA. Higher 5-ALA doses result in more PPIX conversion, an observation with implications for future dosing in LGG. © AANS 2022.","American Association of Neurological Surgeons","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

Therefore, the detection of gasdermin D represents in vivo evidence of pyroptosis. We recently showed that there is intra-amniotic inflammasome activation in spontaneous labor at term; however, evidence of pyroptosis is lacking. The objectives of this study were to investigate (1) whether gasdermin D is detectable in the amniotic fluid of women who delivered at term; (2) whether amniotic fluid gasdermin D concentrations are associated with the process of spontaneous labor at term; and (3) whether gasdermin D is expressed in the chorioamniotic membranes from these patients. Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study included amniotic fluid samples from 41 women who underwent spontaneous labor at term (n = 17) or delivered at term without labor (n = 24). As a readout of pyroptosis, gasdermin D was determined in amniotic fluid samples using a specific and sensitive ELISA kit. The 90th percentile of amniotic fluid gasdermin D concentrations was calculated among women without spontaneous labor at term (reference group). The association between high amniotic fluid gasdermin D concentrations (≥90th percentile in the reference group) and spontaneous labor at term was tested using the Fisher’s exact test. A p value <.05 was considered significant. Multiplex immunofluorescence staining and phenoptics (multispectral imaging) were performed to determine gasdermin D expression in the chorioamniotic membranes and to colocalize this protein with the inflammasome-related molecules caspase-1 and interleukin-1β. Results: (1) Gasdermin D is present in the amniotic fluid of women who delivered at term; (2) the 90th percentile of amniotic fluid gasdermin D concentrations in women who delivered at term without spontaneous labor was 3.4 ng/mL; (3) the proportion of women with amniotic fluid gasdermin D concentrations above the threshold was higher in those who underwent term labor than in those who delivered at term without labor; (4) amniotic fluid concentrations of gasdermin D > 3.4 ng/mL were significantly associated with the presence of spontaneous labor in women who delivered at term (odds ratio 6.0, p-value.048); and (5) the protein expression of gasdermin D is increased in the chorioamniotic membranes of women who underwent spontaneous labor at term and is colocalized with caspase-1 and IL-1β. Conclusions: Gasdermin D is increased in the amniotic fluid and chorioamniotic membranes of women who underwent spontaneous labor at term compared to those without labor. These data provide evidence implicating pyroptosis in the mechanisms that lead to the sterile inflammatory process of term parturition. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Cyclic GMP AMP synthase (cGAS) is a cytosolic DNA sensor that recognizes dsDNA and creates cGAMP to activate STING-mediated type I IFN production. The activation of STING induces lupus disease in Fcgr2b deficient mice through the differentiation of dendritic cells. In contrast, Cgas-deficient mice could be generated more autoantibody production and proteinuria in pristane-induced lupus (PIL). These data suggested that the other dsDNA sensors could be involved in lupus development mechanisms. Methods: This study aimed to identify the cGAS-mediated mechanisms contributing to lupus pathogenesis in PIL. The Cgas-deficient and WT mice were induced lupus disease with pristane and subsequently analyzed autoantibody, histopathology, and immunophenotypes. The lung tissues were analyzed with the expression profiles by RT-PCR and western blot. The bone marrow-derived macrophages were stimulated with inflammasome activators and observed pyroptosis. Results: The Cgas-/- mice developed more severe pulmonary hemorrhage and autoantibody production than WT mice. The activated dendritic cells, IFN-g-, and IL-17a-producing T helper cells, and infiltrated macrophages in the lung were detected in Cgas-/- mice higher than in WT mice. We observed an increase in expression of Aim2, Casp11, and Ifi16 in the lung and serum IL-1a but IL-1b in pristane-injected Cgas-/- mice. The rise of Caspase-11 in the lung of pristane-injected Cgas-/- mice suggested noncanonical inflammasome activation. The activation of AIM2 and NLRP3 inflammasomes in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) enhanced the number of dead cells in Cgas-/- mice compared with WT mice. Activation of the inflammasome significantly induced pyroptosis in Cgas-/- BMDMs. The dsDNA level, but not mitochondrial DNA, increased dramatically in pristane-injected Cgas-/- mice suggesting the dsDNA could be a ligand activating inflammasomes. The cGAS agonist-induced BMDM activation in the Cgas-/- mice indicated that the activation of DNA sensors other than cGAS enhanced activated macrophages. Conclusion: These findings suggested that cGAS hampers the unusual noncanonical inflammasome activation through other DNA sensors.

An ideal method would provide three-dimensional quantitative information, high spatial resolution, deep tissue penetration, and contrast between tissue and material structures. Photoacoustic (PA) or optoacoustic imaging is a hybrid technique that allows three-dimensional imaging with high spatial resolution. In addition, photoacoustic imaging allows for imaging of vascularization based on the intrinsic contrast of hemoglobin. In this study, we investigated photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) as a tool for longitudinal monitoring of an implanted hydrogel in a small animal model. Hydrogels were loaded with gold nanorods to enhance contrast and imaged weekly for 8 weeks. PACT allowed non-invasive three-dimensional, quantitative imaging of the hydrogels over the entire 8 weeks. Quantitative volume analysis was used to evaluate the in vivo degradation kinetics of the implants which deviated slightly from in vitro predictions. Multispectral imaging allowed for the simultaneous analysis of hydrogel degradation and local vascularization.

Targeting strategies that integrate effective RAM regulation with imaging-based monitoring could lead to improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of RA. Here, we report the combined use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAsT/I) and Prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) to silence the expression of proinflammatory cytokines TNFα/IL-6 and scavenge the ROS associated with RAM. To enhance the in vitro and in vivo biological stability, biocompatibility, and targeting capability of the siRNAsT/I and PBNPs, macrophage membrane vesicles were used to prepare biomimetic nanoparticles, M@P-siRNAsT/I. The resulting constructs were found to suppress tumor necrosis factor-α/ interleukin-6 expression and overcome the hypoxic nature of RAM, thus alleviating RA-induced joint damage in a mouse model. The M@P-siRNAsT/I of this study could be monitored via near-infrared photoacoustic (PA) imaging. Moreover, multispectral PA imaging without the need for labeling permitted the real-time evaluation of M@P-siRNAsT/I as a putative RA treatment. Clinical microcomputed tomography and histological analysis confirmed the effectiveness of the treatment. We thus suggest that macrophage-biomimetic M@P-siRNAsT/I and their analogs assisted by PA imaging could provide a new strategy for RA diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring.

Tissue samples taken during surgery are either subject to a preliminary intraoperative histological analysis, or sent for a full pathological evaluation which can take days or weeks. Whereas a lengthy complete pathological analysis includes an array of techniques to be executed, a preliminary tissue analysis on frozen tissue is performed as quickly as possible (30-45 minutes on average) to provide fast feedback to the surgeon during the surgery. The surgeon uses the information to confirm that the resected tissue is indeed tumor and may, at least in theory, initiate repeated biopsies to help achieve gross total resection. However, due to the total turn-around time of the tissue inspection for repeated analyses, this approach may not be feasible during a single surgery. In this context, intraoperative image-guided techniques can improve the clinical workflow for tumor resection and improve outcome by aiding in the identification and removal of the malignant lesion. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an optical imaging technique with the potential to extract combined spectral-spatial information. By exploiting HSI for human brain-tissue classification in 13 in-vivo hyperspectral images from 9 patients, a brain-tissue classifier is developed. The framework consists of a hybrid 3D-2D CNN-based approach and a band-selection step to enhance the capability of extracting both spectral and spatial information from the hyperspectral images. An overall accuracy of 77% was found when tumor, normal and hyper-vascularized tissue are classified, which clearly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches (SVM, 2D-CNN). These results may open an attractive future perspective for intraoperative brain-tumor classification using HSI.  © 2021 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Current methods are either invasive or have a limited wavelength spectrum, which restricts utility. This proof of concept study describes the development of a multispectral imaging (MSI) method called multispectral tissue mapping (MTM) that addresses these issues. Approach: The imaging system consists of a tunable excitation light source and a near-infrared camera. Following the development stage, proof of concept experiments are carried out where absorption spectra from colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver steatosis specimen are acquired and compared to controls. Absorption spectra are compared to histopathology examination as the current gold standard for tissue assessment. Generalized linear mixed modeling is employed to compare absorption characteristics of individual pixels and to select wavelengths for false color image processing with the aim of visually enhancing cancer tissue. Results: Analysis of individual pixels revealed distinct absorption spectra therefore suggesting that MTM is possible. A prominent absorption peak at 1210 nm was found in lipid-rich animal tissues and steatotic liver specimen. Liver cancer tissue had a heterogeneous appearance on MSI. Subsequent statistical analysis suggests that measuring changes in absorption behavior may be a feasible method to estimate the pixel-based probability of cancer being present. In CRLM, this was observed throughout 1100 to 1700 nm, whereas in HCC it was concentrated around 1140 and 1430 nm. False color image processing visibly enhances contrast between cancer and normal liver tissues. Conclusions: The system's ability to enable no-touch MSI at 1100 to 1700 nm was demonstrated. Preliminary data suggest that MTM warrants further exploration as a potential imaging tool for the detection of liver cancer during surgery.  © The Authors.

Here, 2D germanium telluride (GeTe) nanosheets coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) (GeTe-PVP NSs) developed as theranostic agents are reported that can be used for multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) and fluorescence imaging and therapy of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). GeTe-PVP NSs, fabricated by simple sonication in ethanol and PVP, show broad optical absorption in visible and near-infrared (NIR) ranges (400–1200 nm) and have intrinsic fluorescence properties. Thus, they provide deeper ex vivo and in vivo MSOT tissue images than gold nanorods or indocyanine green with strong optical absorption in the first NIR window (700–900 nm). In addition, when orally administered to IBD mice, GeTe-PVP NSs exhibit therapeutic efficacy similar to or higher than sulfasalazine, with strong accumulation at inflammatory colon sites. This demonstrates that oral administration of GeTe-PVP NSs may be used to treat inflammatory diseases in the gastrointestinal tract. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","John Wiley and Sons Inc","Article","","Scopus"

We use SWIR-MPI to monitor clinically important physiological processes including edema, inflammation, and tumor lipid heterogeneity in preclinical models. We also show that SWIR-MPI can spatially map blood-lipids in humans, representing an example of non-invasive and contact-free measurements of in vivo blood lipids.

The system consists of a two-dimensional (2D) Pd-based nanozyme conjugated with glucose oxidase (GOx). The combination of nanozyme and GOx can induce the PA signal variation of endogenous molecules. Combined with the PA response of the nanozyme, we can simultaneously map the 3D PA signals of dynamic endogenous and exogenous molecules associated with the catalytic process, thus providing a real-time non-invasive visualization.

We acquired a hyper-spectral data cube of each patient with wavelengths ranging from 450 to 650 nm at an internal of 2 nm, followed by quantitative analysis of the spectral contribution of three known ingredients in skin tissues: Oxy-hemoglobin(HbO2), deoxy-hemoglobin(Hb) and melanin using an Independent Component Correlation Algorithm (ICA) method. Our analysis results suggested that the proportion of melanin and the total hemoglobin in VLS subjects were different from normal subjects. The segmentation of VLS regions based on the index of melanin and total hemoglobin are close to the VLS regions marked by a clinician.

Near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) can obtain optical information from deep inside tissues. However, far less progress has been made in the development of techniques for distinguishing deep lesions like GIST. This study aimed to investigate whether NIR-HSI is suitable for distinguishing deep SMT lesions. In this study, 12 gastric GIST lesions were surgically resected and imaged with an NIR hyperspectral camera from the aspect of the mucosal surface. Thus, the images were obtained ex-vivo. The site of the GIST was defined by a pathologist using the NIR image to prepare training data for normal and GIST regions. A machine learning algorithm, support vector machine, was then used to predict normal and GIST regions. Results were displayed using color-coded regions. Although 7 specimens had a mucosal layer (thickness 0.4–2.5 mm) covering the GIST lesion, NIR-HSI analysis by machine learning showed normal and GIST regions as color-coded areas. The specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of the results were 73.0%, 91.3%, and 86.1%, respectively.

Previously employed signal processing techniques have proven insufficient to remove the effects of electrical noise because they typically rely on simplified models and fail to capture complex characteristics of signal and noise. Moreover, they often involve time-consuming processing steps that are unsuited for real-time imaging applications. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a discriminative deep learning approach to separate electrical noise from optoacoustic signals prior to image reconstruction. The proposed deep learning algorithm is based on two key features. First, it learns spatiotemporal correlations in both noise and signal by using the entire optoacoustic sinogram as input. Second, it employs training on a large dataset of experimentally acquired pure noise and synthetic optoacoustic signals. We validated the ability of the trained model to accurately remove electrical noise on synthetic data and on optoacoustic images of a phantom and the human breast. We demonstrate significant enhancements of morphological and spectral optoacoustic images reaching 19% higher blood vessel contrast and localized spectral contrast at depths of more than 2 cm for images acquired in vivo. We discuss how the proposed denoising framework is applicable to clinical multispectral optoacoustic tomography and suitable for real-time operation. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Ten porcine lungs were randomly divided into control and donation after circulatory death (DCD) groups (n = 5, each). Lungs were perfused in cellular EVLP for 2 h, and multispectral images were continuously collected from the dorsal sides of the lower lobes. We examined whether lower lobe SaO2 correlated with PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratios in lower pulmonary veins (PV). The wet/dry ratio in lower lobes was measured and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to investigate the method’s feasibility. There was a significant correlation between lower lobe SaO2 and the P/F ratio in lower PV (r = 0.855, P < 0.001). The DCD group was associated with lower SaO2 and higher wet/dry ratio than the control group (P < 0.001). The error of estimated SaO2 was limited according to Monte Carlo simulations.

Data collected by the HSI system carry information of the tissue texture and may potentially track structural modifications caused by thermal treatment providing an alternative approach to the direct monitoring of the thermal outcome induced during the treatment. In this work, a commercial hyperspectral (HS) camera, working in the visible and near-infrared spectral range, has been tested for the estimation of thermal damage in the ex vivo liver. Firstly, the optimal experimental setup and settings to evaluate the optical response of tissues with the HSI were identified. Then, the reflectance of not-damaged tissue (room temperature) and tissue subjected to thermal damage was acquired and compared. Specifically, the damage was induced by homogeneously heating the tissue until reaching 50.0 °C and 70.0 °C. Inter-individual and intra-individual variability analysis was also computed using multiple samples and showed that by using the first derivative of reflectance the sources of variability are minimized. Furthermore, the first derivative shows variation in the shape mainly localized in the range [600-900] nm. These results confirm the potential of using the hyperspectral camera to assess different levels of damage during thermal therapies encouraging additional studies to validate its use as a monitoring tool.  © 2022 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Conference paper","","Scopus"

While optical (photonic) microscopy is commonly employed to visualize the tumour microenvironment, it assesses only a few hundred cubic microns of tissue. Therefore, it is not suitable for investigating biological processes at the level of the entire tumour, which can be at least four orders of magnitude larger. In this study, we aimed to extend optical visualization and resolve spatial heterogeneity throughout the entire tumour volume. We developed an optoacoustic (photoacoustic) mesoscope adapted to solid tumour imaging and, in a pilot study, offer the first insights into cancer optical contrast heterogeneity in vivo at an unprecedented resolution of <50 μm throughout the entire tumour mass. Using spectral methods, we resolve unknown patterns of oxygenation, vasculature and perfusion in three types of breast cancer and showcase different levels of structural and functional organization. To our knowledge, these results are the most detailed insights of optical signatures reported throughout entire tumours in vivo, and they position optoacoustic mesoscopy as a unique investigational tool linking microscopic and macroscopic observations. © 2020, The Author(s).","Springer Nature","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

KcapTR488 contains a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) conjugated with Texas Red, a caspase-cleavable sequence (DEVD), and a C-terminus conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488). The synthesis and preliminary evaluation in cellulo of KcapTR488 for monitoring cell death by fluorescence imaging has been previously reported, but its utility in vivo has yet to be tested or validated. Herein, in vitro solution experiments verified the intramolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the two fluorophores and enabled a quantitative analysis of enzyme rates and selectivity. The sensor delivery kinetics in live rat models were quantified by ex vivo fluorescence microscopy. Studies in healthy control retinas demonstrated that KcapTR488 concentrated in the nucleus of retinal ganglion cells (RGC), with a strong colocalization of red and green fluorescence signals producing robust FRET signals, indicating an intact reporter. By contrast, using an acute but mild NMDA-induced retinal injury model, dual-color confocal ex vivo microscopy of cleaved KcapTR488 identified sensor activation as early as 2 h after injection. Quantitative changes in fluorescence colocalization were superior to changes in FRET for monitoring injury progression. Longitudinal monitoring revealed that the NLS-Texas Red fragment of the cleaved sensor moved out of the cell body, down the axon, and exited the retina, consistent with anterograde axonal transport. Thus, KcapTR488 may be a powerful tool to study RGC death pathways in live preclinical models of glaucoma. © 2022 by the authors.","MDPI","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Using a diet-induced model of NAFLD and monocarboxylate transporter-1 (Mct1+/−) haploinsufficient mice, which resist high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis, we investigated the hypothesis that NAFLD leads to an encephalopathy by altering cognition, behaviour, and cerebral physiology. We also proposed that global MCT1 downregulation offers cerebral protection. Methods: Behavioural tests were performed in mice following 16 weeks of control diet (normal chow) or high-fat diet with high fructose/glucose in water. Tissue oxygenation, cerebrovascular reactivity, and cerebral blood volume were monitored under anaesthesia by multispectral optoacoustic tomography and optical fluorescence. Cortical mitochondrial oxygen consumption and respiratory capacities were measured using ex vivo high-resolution respirometry. Microglial and astrocytic changes were evaluated by immunofluorescence and 3D reconstructions. Body composition was assessed using EchoMRI, and liver steatosis was confirmed by histology. Results: NAFLD concomitant with obesity is associated with anxiety- and depression-related behaviour. Low-grade brain tissue hypoxia was observed, likely attributed to the low-grade brain inflammation and decreased cerebral blood volume. It is also accompanied by microglial and astrocytic morphological and metabolic alterations (higher oxygen consumption), suggesting the early stages of an obesogenic diet-induced encephalopathy. Mct1 haploinsufficient mice, despite fat accumulation in adipose tissue, were protected from NAFLD and associated cerebral alterations. Conclusions: This study provides evidence of compromised brain health in obesity and NAFLD, emphasising the importance of the liver–brain axis. The protective effect of Mct1 haploinsufficiency points to this protein as a novel therapeutic target for preventing and/or treating NAFLD and the associated brain dysfunction. Impact and implications: This study is focused on unravelling the pathophysiological mechanism by which cerebral dysfunction and cognitive decline occurs during NAFLD and exploring the potential of monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT1) as a novel preventive or therapeutic target. Our findings point to NAFLD as a serious health risk and its adverse impact on the brain as a potential global health system and economic burden. These results highlight the utility of Mct1 transgenic mice as a model for NAFLD and associated brain dysfunction and call for systematic screening by physicians for early signs of psychological symptoms, and an awareness by individuals at risk of these potential neurological effects. This study is expected to bring attention to the need for early diagnosis and treatment of NAFLD, while having a direct impact on policies worldwide regarding the health risk associated with NAFLD, and its prevention and treatment. © 2022 The Author(s)","Elsevier B.V.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Methods: The accuracy of T1 and T2 measurements was evaluated with 2 coils [head and neck unit (HNU) and BODY coils] on phantoms using descriptive statistics and Bland–Altman analysis. The reproducibility and repeatability of T1 and T2 measurements were performed on 15 sessions with the HNU coil. The T1 and T2 synthetic sequences obtained by both methods were evaluated according to quality assurance (QA) requirements for radiotherapy. T1 and T2 in vivo measurements of the brain or prostate tissues of two groups of five subjects were also compared. Results: The phantom results showed good agreement (mean bias, 8.4%) between the two measurement methods for T1 values between 490 and 2,385 ms and T2 values between 25 and 400 ms. MAGiC® gave discordant results for T1 values below 220 ms (bias with the reference values, from 38% to 1,620%). T2 measurements were accurately estimated below 400 ms (mean bias, 8.5%) by both methods. The QA assessments are in agreement with the recommendations of imaging for contouring purposes for radiotherapy planning. On patient data of the brain and prostate, the measurements of T1 and T2 by the two quantitative MRI (qMRI) methods were comparable (max difference, <7%). Conclusion: This study shows that the accuracy, reproducibility, and repeatability of the multispectral pulse sequence (MAGiC®) were compatible with its use for radiotherapy treatment planning in a range of values corresponding to soft tissues. Even validated for brain imaging, MAGiC® could potentially be used for prostate qMRI.

Current in-vivo classification procedures are executed under the supervision of an expert. However, this methodology could be subjective and time-consuming. In this work, we propose a classification method for in-vivo hyperspectral brain images to identify areas affected by glioblastomas based on nonlinear spectral unmixing. This methodology follows a semi-supervised approach for the estimation of the end-members in a multi-linear model. To improve the classification results, we vary the number of end-members per-class to address spectral variability of each studied type of tissue. Once the set of end-members is obtained, the classification map is generated according to the end-member with the highest abundance in each pixel, followed by morphological operations to smooth the resulting maps. The classification results demonstrate that the proposed methodology generates high performance in the regions of interest, with an accuracy above 0.75 and 0.96 in the inter and intra-patient strategies, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed methodology has the potential to be used as an assistant tool in the diagnosis of glioblastoma in hyperspectral imaging.  © 2022 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Conference paper","","Scopus"

To that end, three synchronisation processes with different final bleach and sodium hydroxide concentrations were performed. The impact of treatments was characterised by measuring egg viability and morphology, besides capturing multispectral images of both nematode bodies and eggs. Multispectral images consisted of seven slices captured from different wavelengths within the visible/infrared spectrum by different light-pass filters. The results showed dependence between increased alkaline hypochlorite concentration and loss of egg viability/morphology. This relation was also observed for the imaging data, which showed alterations to tissue transmittance for all the tested wavelengths for both bodies and eggs. Localised alterations related to alkaline hypochlorite diffusion through anatomical nematode orifices were recognised. Applying multivariate methods to imaging data successfully characterised tissue alterations, from which treatment type was predicted for both nematodes and eggs. Moreover, the alterations recorded by imaging data were also used to predict egg viability regardless of treatment type (0.94).

Ultrasound-guided fineneedle aspiration is the current gold standard to diagnose thyroid cancers, but the results are inaccurate, leading to repeated biopsies and unnecessary surgeries. To reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies, we explored the use of multiparametric photoacoustic (PA) analysis in combination with the American Thyroid Association (ATA) Guideline (ATAP). In this study, we performed in vivo multispectral PA imaging on thyroid nodules from 52 patients, comprising 23 papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and 29 benign cases. From the multispectral PA data, we calculated hemoglobin oxygen saturation level in the nodule area, then classified the PTC and benign nodules with multiparametric analysis. Statistical analyses showed that this multiparametric analysis of multispectral PA responses could classify PTC nodules. Combining the photoacoustically indicated probability of PTC and the ATAP led to a new scoring method that achieved a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 93%. This study is the first multiparametric analysis of multispectral PA data of thyroid nodules with statistical significance. As a proof of concept, the results show that the proposed new ATAP scoring can help physicians examine thyroid nodules for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, thus reducing unnecessary biopsies. © 2021 American Association for Cancer Research Inc..

Due to the layered skin structure, skin tissue models are often divided into multiple layers with their associated optical properties. Typically, in the analysis, some model parameters defining these properties are fixed to values reported in the literature to speed up the fitting process and improve its performance. In the absence of consensus, various studies use different approaches in fixing the model parameters. This study aims to assess the effect of fixing various model parameters in the skin spectra fitting process on the accuracy and robustness of a GPU-accelerated two-layer inverse adding-doubling (IAD) algorithm. Specifically, the performance of the IAD method is determined for noiseless simulated skin spectra, simulated spectra with different levels of noise applied, and in-vivo measured reflectance spectra from hyperspectral images of human hands recorded before, during, and after the arterial occlusion. Our results suggest that fixing multiple parameters to a priori known values generally improves the robustness and accuracy of the IAD algorithm for simulated spectra. However, for in-vivo measured spectra, these values are unknown in advance and fixing optical parameters to incorrect values significantly deteriorates the overall performance. Therefore, we propose a method to improve the fitting performance by pre-estimating model parameters. Our findings could be considered in all future research involving the analysis of diffuse reflectance spectra to extract optical properties of skin tissue. © 2022 OSA - The Optical Society.

Challenges are presented by standard-of-care sentinel lymph node dissection which must be quick and accurate enough to guide the surgical strategy despite a workflow that stretches from the operating room to the pathology lab; however, a solution is posed by fluorescence-assisted sentinel lymph node dissection which uses fluorescent probes to communicate the location and/or status of sentinel lymph nodes, reducing the complexity of the surgery and/or eliminating the need for rapid pathology. In support of this emerging modality, we have constructed a snapshot hyperspectral imaging system with sensitivity from the far-red to the near-infrared that enables sentinel lymph node dissection with multiple near-infrared fluorophores. We have also developed a spectral unmixing routine for in vivo quantification of the readily available fluorophores indocyanine green and methylene blue that can be extended to emerging fluorophores that actively target tumor cells. Both the imaging system and the unmixing routine have been tested in a clinical setting where they have successfully discriminated two dyes exhibiting different distributions. © 2021 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

In clinical practices, intraoperative tumor boundaries delineation facilitates to accomplish tumor resection with negative margin, remarkably decreasing the recurrence rates. Currently, ultrasound (US) and ICG fluorescence-guided surgery has been used for intraoperative navigation in irregular hepatectomy, but insufficient specificity results in a limited prevalence. Inspired by the high resolution of photoacoustic (PA) imaging and established clinical efficacy of 18F-Alfatide that is specific for integrin αvβ3-overexpressed tumors, we herein developed a fluorescent analogue IR820-E[c(RGDfK)]2, and a proof-of-concept intraoperative multispectral PA imaging navigation for precise irregular hepatectomy using hand-held PA/US imaging system. An integrin αvβ3-targeted fluorescent contrast agent IR820-E[c(RGDfK)]2 was designed, synthesized, and characterized. In vitro studies were performed to determine optical and PA properties, affinity and specificity and biocompatibility. Multispectral PA imaging, the optimal imaging time point and contrast, multispectral PA imaging-guided irregular hepatectomy, pharmacokinetics, and safety profile were evaluated in subcutaneous and orthotopic HCC tumor models. Ex vivo macroscopic three-dimensions (3D) PA imaging with IR820-E[c(RGDfK)]2 staining was also performed in surgical biospecimens from patients with HCC. IR820-E[c(RGDfK)]2 has a simple synthetic method at gram scale, high affinity, and specificity for integrin αvβ3, excellent pharmacokinetic and safety profile can effectively differentiate tumor from normal liver tissues in animal models and surgical biospecimens from HCC patients. Preoperative tumor localization, intraoperative tumor boundaries delineation, and tumor excision, and postoperative negative margin assessment were successfully achieved during irregular hepatectomy. This initial attempt allows one to preoperatively detect tumor lesions, intraoperatively delineate tumor boundaries and guide tumor resection, and postoperatively evaluate tumor margin status during irregular hepatectomy. IR820-E[c(RGDfK)]2 has the potential to be an investigational new drug for clinical use in multispectral photoacoustic imaging-guided irregular hepatectomy.

Different intraoperative guidance tools are currently employed during the resection tumor but having several limitations. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is arising as a label-free and non-ionizing technique that could assist neurosurgeons during surgical procedures. In this paper, an analysis between in-vivo and ex-vivo human brain tumor samples using HSI has been performed to evaluate the correlation between both types of samples. Spectral ratios of the oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin were employed to distinguish between normal tissue, tumor tissue and blood vessels. A database composed by seven in-vivo and fourteen ex-vivo hyperspectral images obtained from seven different patients diagnosed with glioblastoma Grade IV, metastatic secondary breast cancer, meningioma Grade I and II, and astrocytoma (glioma) Grade II. 44,964 pixels labeled pixels were employed in this work. The proposed method achieved discrimination between different tissue types using the proposed spectral ratio. Comparison between in-vivo and ex-vivo samples indicated that ex-vivo samples generate higher hemoglobin ratios. Moreover, vascular enhanced maps were generated using the spectral ratio, targeting real-time intraoperative surgical assistance.  © 2022 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

The mechanical properties of a pregnant woman's cervix change dramatically during gestation due to a remodeling of its microstructure, necessary for delivery. However, external factors can accelerate this process and lead to prematurity, the primary cause of perinatal mortality worldwide, due to the inefficiency of existing diagnostic methods. This study shows that polarized light is a powerful tool to probe the cervical microstructure during pregnancy. A wide-field multispectral polarimetric imaging system was fabricated to explore in vivo the cervix of full-term pregnant women. The polarimetric properties of the cervix change significantly with pregnancy progression. In particular, a set of several depolarization parameters (intrinsic and extrinsic) showed a strong linear correlation with gestational age in the red part of the visible spectral range. This trend can be attributed, among other things, to a decrease in collagen density and an increase in hydration of cervical connective tissue. Wide field depolarization imaging is a very promising tool for rapid and non-invasive analysis of cervical tissue in vivo to monitor the steady progression of pregnancy, providing the practitioner with useful information to improve the detection of preterm birth. © 2022, The Author(s).","Nature Research","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This study demonstrates an innovative noninvasive technique using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for monitoring RF ablative therapy in ex-vivo liver tissue. The cubic data generated by HSI provides spectral as well as spatial properties of the liver tissue included in each pixel of the field of view.

The drug delivery system was synthesized by a green, one pot method which involved simple mixing of reactants, with no heating or toxic chemicals. Additionally, GNPs also display intrinsic anti-cancer attributes on their own, which is expected to further amplify the anticancer effect of the system. Curcumin release was activated by a handheld low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) device. It is hypothesized that the moderate rise in tissue temperature (up to 43°C) together with mechanical effects of LIPUS beam induces effective release of curcumin from the surface of GNP.

Drusen are focal and can be recognized clinically. In contrast BLinD is thin and diffusely distributed, and invisible clinically, even on highest resolution OCT, but has been detected on en face hyperspectral autofluorescence (AF) imaging ex vivo. We sought to optimize histologic hyperspectral AF imaging and image analysis for recognition of drusen and sub-RPE deposits (including BLinD and basal laminar deposit), for potential clinical application. Methods: Twenty locations specifically with drusen and 12 additional locations specifically from fovea, perifovea and mid-periphery from RPE/BrM flatmounts from 4 AMD donors underwent hyperspectral AF imaging with 4 excitation wavelengths (λex 436, 450, 480 and 505 nm), and the resulting image cubes were simultaneously decomposed with our published non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Rank 4 recovery of 4 emission spectra was chosen for each excitation wavelength. Results: A composite emission spectrum, sensitive and specific for drusen and presumed sub-RPE deposits (the SDr spectrum) was recovered with peak at 510-520 nm in all tissues with drusen, with greatest amplitudes at excitations λex 436, 450 and 480 nm. The RPE spectra of combined sources Lipofuscin (LF)/ Melanolipofuscin (MLF) were of comparable amplitude and consistently recapitulated the spectra S1, S2 and S3 previously reported from all tissues: tissues with drusen, foveal and extra-foveal locations. Conclusions: A clinical hyperspectral AF camera, with properly chosen excitation wavelengths in the blue range and a hyperspectral AF detector, should be capable of detecting and quantifying drusen and sub-RPE deposits, the earliest known lesions of AMD, before any other currently available imaging modality. © 2021 AME Publishing Company.

Two illumination methods were tested in two cholesteatoma surgeries. In addition, two cholesteatom samples were illuminated and analyzed ex vivo. Cholesteatoma showed:fluorescent characteristics in our ex vivo analysis.

However, their clinical translation has been limited by the requirement of prohibitively high therapeutic doses due to their lack of specificity in delivery and, consequently, short systemic half-life. To overcome these challenges, we engineered a platform for modifying exosomes with an active targeting modality composed of membrane Anchor (BODIPY)-Spacer (PEG)-targeting Ligands (cyclic RGD peptide) (ASL). Herein, we show that the intramembrane incorporation of a trackable, targeting system renders ASL exosomes (AExs) a modular platform. AExs significantly overcome challenges associated with exosome modification, including potential damage for functionalization, or destabilizing interactions between dyes and drugs. ASL-modification not only enhanced stability in imparting active targeting but also introduced a built-in bioimaging modality. Our studies show that AExs target B16F10 melanoma tumor sites by the specific interaction of cyclic RGD and integrin. Doxorubicin encapsulated AExs (dAExs) significantly inhibited the growth of melanoma in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we conclude that ASL-modification allows exosomes to be transformed into a novel therapeutic vehicle uniquely integrating in vivo tracking and robust targeting with drug delivery. We anticipate that the therapeutic, targeting, and diagnostic modularity provided by ASL will potentiate translational applications of exosome-based vehicles beyond anticancer therapy.  © ","American Chemical Society","Article","","Scopus"

Early diagnosis significantly increases the chances of survival; therefore, improved assisted exploration and screening techniques are necessary. Previously, we made use of an augmented multi-spectral endoscope by inserting an optical probe into the instrumentation channel. However, the limited field of view and the lack of markings left by optical biopsies on the tissue complicate the navigation and revisit of the suspect areas probed in-vivo. In this contribution two innovative tools are introduced to significantly increase the traceability and monitoring of patients in clinical practice: (i) video mosaicing to build a more comprehensive and panoramic view of large gastric areas; (ii) optical biopsy targeting and registration with the endoscopic images. The proposed optical flow-based mosaicing technique selects images that minimize texture discontinuities and is robust despite the lack of texture and illumination variations. The optical biopsy targeting is based on automatic tracking of a free-marker probe in the endoscopic view using deep learning to dynamically estimate its pose during exploration. The accuracy of pose estimation is sufficient to ensure a precise overlapping of the standard white-light color image and the hyperspectral probe image, assuming that the small target area of the organ is almost flat. This allows the mapping of all spatio-temporally tracked biopsy sites onto the panoramic mosaic. Experimental validations are carried out from videos acquired on patients in hospital. The proposed technique is purely software-based and therefore easily integrable into clinical practice. It is also generic and compatible to any imaging modality that connects to a fiberscope. © 2022","Elsevier Ltd","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

This includes elevated blood circulation, tissue oxygenation, and perfusion. Cold physical plasma promotes wound healing in animal models and humans. Physical plasmas are multicomponent systems that generate several physicochemical effectors, such as ions, electrons, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and UV radiation. However, the consequences of plasma treatment on wound oxygenation and perfusion, vital processes to promote tissue regeneration, are largely unexplored. We used a novel hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system and a murine dermal full-thickness wound model in combination with kINPen argon plasma jet treatment to address this question. Plasma treatment promoted tissue oxygenation in superficial as well as deep (6 mm) layers of wound tissue. In addition to perfusion changes, we found a wound healing stage-dependent shift of tissue hemoglobin and tissue water index during reactive species-driven wound healing. Contactless, fast monitoring of medical parameters in real-time using HSI revealed a plasma-supporting effect in wound healing together with precise information about biological surface-specific features. © 2017 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

It is expected to play an important role in advancing the emerging field of molecular medicine by yielding detailed information on structures and dynamics at subcellular levels. This review, truly interdisciplinary and unique in its scope, highlights the integrated roles of the above-named disciplines for advancing IR bioimaging, aiming to attract a broad cross-section of readership of Physics Reports, and is written with multinational authorship to bring out a global perspective. A unique feature of this review is its comprehensive coverage of a multitude of the various optical bioimaging modalities, their physics principles, their relative merits, and their complementarity. Specifically covered themes are fluorescence imaging, nonlinear optical imaging, photoacoustic imaging, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and hyperspectral imaging. The review first discusses light propagation and bio-optics of processes of light absorption, scattering and transmission in biological media. It describes the various biological spectral windows of maximum optical transparencies which are suitable for optical imaging. Then, we introduce the different optical imaging modalities and their features in bioimaging both in vitro and in vivo. The role of molecular and nano-probes to serve as contrast agents for different modalities of imaging is described. A unique aspect also discussed in this review is the physics of manipulation of excitation dynamics that can make them selectively nanoemitters for fluorescence imaging; nonlinear optical probes for imaging; nano-photothermal heaters and nanothermometry for photoacoustic imaging; and nanoscatterers for OCT. As selected emerging applications, we describe imaging-guided theranostics as well as applications in novel areas of neurophotonics and nanodentistry.

However, monitoring the size of the resulting tissue damage during the thermal removal procedures is a challenging task. The objective of this study was to evaluate the observation of RFA on an ex vivo liver sample with both a commercial and a low-cost system to distinguish between the normal and the ablated regions as well as the thermally affected regions. RFA trials were conducted on five different ex vivo normal bovine samples and monitored initially by a custom hyperspectral (HS) camera to measure the diffuse reflectance (Rd ) utilising a polychromatic light source (tungsten halogen lamp) within the spectral range 348–950 nm. Next, the light source was replaced with monochromatic LEDs (415, 565 and 660 nm) and a commercial charge-coupled device (CCD) camera was used instead of the HS camera. The system algorithm comprises image enhancement (normalisation and moving average filter) and image segmentation with K-means clustering, combining spectral and spatial information to assess the variable responses to polychromatic light and monochromatic LEDs to highlight the differences in the Rd properties of thermally affected/normal tissue regions. The measured spectral signatures of the various regions, besides the calculation of the standard deviations (δ) between the generated six groups, guided us to select three optimal wavelengths (420, 540 and 660 nm) to discriminate between these various regions. Next, we selected six spectral images to apply the image processing to (at 450, 500, 550, 600, 650 and 700 nm). We noticed that the optimum image is the superimposed spectral images at 550, 600, 650 and 700 nm, which are capable of discriminating between the various regions. Later, we measured Rd with the CCD camera and commercially available monochromatic LED light sources at 415, 565 and 660 nm. Compared to the HS camera results, this system was more capable of identifying the ablated and the thermally affected regions of surface RFA than the side-penetration RFA of the investigated ex vivo liver samples. However, we succeeded in developing a low-cost system that provides satisfactory information to highlight the ablated and thermally affected region to improve the outcome of surgical tumour ablation with much shorter time for image capture and processing compared to the HS system. © 2021 The Authors.","IM Publications Open LLP","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Estimation is conducted using the extended modified Lambert–Beer law, which has previously been proven robust to differences in melanin concentration. We introduce a novel wavelength selection algorithm that enables the estimation to be performed with high accuracy using only a small number (5–10) of wavelengths. Validation performed with Monte Carlo simulation data resulted in prediction errors <1%, with no significant differences among various skin types, for as few as five wavelengths under conditions representing both high precision instrumentation and more cost-effective sensors designed with inexpensive LEDs and/or filters. Validation with in vivo data collected from an occlusion study with 13 Asian volunteers showed statistically significant separation between the estimates for the at-rest and arterial occlusion states. Additional stability testing proved the proposed algorithms to be robust to small changes in the selected wavelengths as may occur in a real LED due to manufacturing tolerances and temperature fluctuations. This work concluded that the development of an inexpensive hyperspectral device for wound monitoring in all skin types is feasible using just a small number of wavelengths. © 2022 by the authors.","MDPI","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

In vivo applications of MSI for deep seated fluorophores require consideration of diffusive light propagation in biological tissue. We have previously shown that a well-known redshift of fluorescence spectra in diffusive medium induces a fluorophore cross-talk, which cannot be accounted for even with known optical properties of the medium. In contrast, FLT measurements remain largely unaffected by light propagation in tissue, enabling zero cross-talk and accurate relative quantification. While a fully quantitative estimation of fluorophore concentrations requires depth resolved tomographic imaging, this is often not possible due to the difficulty of estimating tissue optical properties and modelling light propagation in complex tissue geometries. Here, we experimentally investigate the performance of planar (non-tomographic) MSI and FLT multiplexing for the quantitative recovery of multiple near-infrared fluorophores embedded in 4-8 mm thick tissue. We show that FLT multiplexing provides a superior quantification accuracy (error < 10%) compared to MSI (error = 20–107%) in tissue. The error rates for MSI increased with tissue thickness and can be directly attributed to the spectral redshift induced cross-talk between emission spectra. Our data indicate that planar FLT multiplexing can provide high quantification accuracy in thick biological tissue without a need for optical property estimation, thereby offering an important validation tool for rapid quantification of fluorophore concentrations in bulk tissue. © 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement","Optica Publishing Group (formerly OSA)","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Our main goal is the establishment of indicators of the thermal damage of living tissues, which can be used to assess the effect of the procedure. These indicators rely on the spectral variation of temperature-dependent tissue chromophores, i.e., oxyhemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, and water. Laser treatment was performed at specific temperature thresholds (from 60 to 110◦C) on in-vivo animal liver and was assessed with a hyperspectral camera (500–995 nm) during and after the treatment. The indicators were extracted from the hyperspectral images after the following processing steps: the breathing motion compensation and the spectral and spatial filtering, the selection of spectral bands corresponding to specific tissue chromophores, and the analysis of the areas under the curves for each spectral band. Results show that properly combining spectral information related to deoxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, lipids, and water allows for the segmenting of different zones of the laser-induced thermal damage. This preliminary investigation provides indicators for describing the thermal state of the liver, which can be employed in the future as clinical endpoints of the procedure outcome. © 2021 by the authors.

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study in patients with RA or PsA and healthy controls (HCs). Participants underwent clinical, ultrasonographic and MSOT examination of MCP and wrist joints as well as the entheses of the common extensor tendon at the lateral humeral epicondyles and of the patellar, quadriceps and Achilles tendon. MSOT-measured haemoglobin (Hb), oxygen saturation, collagen and lipid levels were quantified and scaled mean differences between affected and unaffected joints and entheses were calculated as defined by clinical examination or ultrasonography using linear mixed effects models. RESULTS: We obtained 1535 MSOT and 982 ultrasonography scans from 87 participants (34 PsA, 17 RA, 36 HCs). Entheseal tenderness was not associated with significant metabolic changes, whereas enthesitis-related sonographic changes were associated with increased total Hb, oxygen saturation and collagen content. In contrast, the presence of arthritis-related clinical and sonographic findings showed increased Hb levels, reduced oxygen saturation and reduced collagen content. Synovial hypertrophy was associated with increased lipid content in the joints. CONCLUSION: MSOT allows determination of distinct metabolic differences between arthritis and enthesitis in a non-invasive setting in humans in vivo. © The Author(s) 2022.

For precise tumor extinguish, thermal ablation outcomes need routine monitoring for tissue necrosis in a challenging research task. The study aims to exploit hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to evaluate the impact of the liver tissue ablation. Materials and Methods: RFA with temperature range (≥80 °C) was accomplished on the ex vivo animal liver and evaluated using a spectral camera (400~1000 nm). The spectral signatures were extracted from the HSI data after the following processing steps: capturing three spectral data cubes for each liver sample with total 7-samples (before ablation, after ablation, and after ablation with sample slicing) using an HSI optical configuration. The custom HSI processing comprises “Top-hat and Bottom-hat transform” combined with “watershed transform” image segmentation to increase the intensity for a region of interest (ROI) of the investigated tissue, linking spectral and spatial data. Additionally, statistical analysis for HSI data was performed to exclusively select the best spectral band that discriminates between the normal, thermally-damaged, and ablated liver regions. Results: The variation of the optical parameters for the investigated liver samples provides variable interaction with the light diffuse reflection (Rd) over the spectrum range (400~1000 nm). Where, the extracting spectral information of the various tissue zones from the induced RFA linked to the hemoglobin, methemoglobin, and water permits variations. The generated spectral image after image enhancement utilizing “Top-hat and Bottom-hat transform” followed by “watershed segmentation”, showed high contrast between normal and thermal regions at a wavelength (600 nm).

To date, the vibrational spectroscopy systems developed for medical applications include single-point measurement probes and intraoperative microscopes. There is a need to develop systems with larger fields of view (FOVs) for rapid intraoperative cancer margin detection during surgery. Aim: We design a handheld macroscopic Raman imaging system for in vivo tissue margin characterization and test its performance in a model system. Approach: The system is made of a sterilizable line scanner employing a coherent fiber bundle for relaying excitation light from a 785-nm laser to the tissue. A second coherent fiber bundle is used for hyperspectral detection of the fingerprint Raman signal over an area of 1 cm2. Machine learning classifiers were trained and validated on porcine adipose and muscle tissue. Results: Porcine adipose versus muscle margin detection was validated ex vivo with an accuracy of 99% over the FOV of 95 mm2 in ∼3 min using a support vector machine. Conclusions: This system is the first large FOV Raman imaging system designed to be integrated in the workflow of surgical cancer resection. It will be further improved with the aim of discriminating brain cancer in a clinically acceptable timeframe during glioma surgery. © The Authors.

Eigenspectra multispectral optoacoustic tomography (eMSOT) and its Bayesian-based implementation have been introduced to offer accurate label-free blood oxygen saturation (sO2) maps in tissues. The method uses the eigenspectra model of light fluence in tissue to account for the spectral changes due to the wavelength dependent attenuation of light with tissue depth. eMSOT relies on the solution of an inverse problem bounded by a number of ad hoc hand-engineered constraints. Despite the quantitative advantage offered by eMSOT, both the non-convex nature of the optimization problem and the possible sub-optimality of the constraints may lead to reduced accuracy. We present herein a neural network architecture that is able to learn how to solve the inverse problem of eMSOT by directly regressing from a set of input spectra to the desired fluence values. The architecture is composed of a combination of recurrent and convolutional layers and uses both spectral and spatial features for inference. We train an ensemble of such networks using solely simulated data and demonstrate how this approach can improve the accuracy of sO2 computation over the original eMSOT, not only in simulations but also in experimental datasets obtained from blood phantoms and small animals (mice) in vivo. The use of a deep-learning approach in optoacoustic sO2 imaging is confirmed herein for the first time on ground truth sO2 values experimentally obtained in vivo and ex vivo.","NLM (Medline)","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

We describe a compact SFDI imager that employs a multispectral compound-eye camera. This design enables simultaneous image acquisition at multiple wavelengths. Such a device has potential for application for quantitative evaluation of superficial tissues by nonspecialists in low-resource settings. Aim: The aim of this work was to develop a compact SFDI imager for widefield imaging of in-vivo tissue optical properties and verify its ability to measure optical properties of tissue-simulating phantoms and in a preclinical model of burn wounds. Approach: This compound-eye imager was constructed using a CMOS sensor subdivided into multiple regions, each having a bandpass filter and objective lens. The ability of the instrument to image optical properties was compared with (1) a commercial SFDI imager and (2) a laboratory-based system. Initial validation of ability to accurately characterize optical properties was performed using a tissue-simulating optical phantom. It was then applied to an established murine model of thermal contact burn severity. In-vivo measurements of the optical properties of rat skin were performed before and after the application of burns. Histology was used to verify burn severity. Results: Measurements of the tissue-simulating phantom optical properties made using the compound-eye imager agree with measurements made using the two comparison SFDI devices. For the murine burn model, the burns showed a decrease in the reduced scattering coefficient at all measurement wavelengths compared with preburn measurements at the same locations. This is consistent with previously reported changes in scattering that occur in full-thickness burns. Conclusion: We demonstrate the potential for SFDI to be translated into compact form factor using a compound-eye camera that is capable of obtaining multiple wavelengths channels simultaneously.  © The Authors.

Knowledge of target volume is a fundamental need for radiation therapy (RT). Without such information to guide radiation, normal tissue can be overirradiated, introducing experimental uncertainties. This led us to develop high-contrast quantitative bioluminescence tomography (QBLT) for guidance. The use of a 3-dimensional bioluminescence signal, related to cell viability, for preclinical radiation research is one step toward biology-guided RT. Methods and Materials: Our QBLT system enables multiprojection and multispectral bioluminescence imaging to maximize input data for the tomographic reconstruction. Accurate quantification of spectrum and dynamic change of in vivo signal were also accounted for the QBLT. A spectral-derivative method was implemented to eliminate the modeling of the light propagation from animal surface to detector. We demonstrated the QBLT capability of guiding conformal RT using a bioluminescent glioblastoma (GBM) model in vivo. A threshold was determined to delineate QBLT reconstructed gross target volume (GTVQBLT), which provides the best overlap between the GTVQBLT and CBCT contrast labeled GBM (GTV), used as the ground truth for GBM volume. To account for the uncertainty of GTVQBLT in target positioning and volume delineation, a margin was determined and added to the GTVQBLT to form a QBLT planning target volume (PTVQBLT) for guidance. Results: The QBLT can reconstruct in vivo GBM with localization accuracy within 1 mm. A 0.5-mm margin was determined and added to GTVQBLT to form PTVQBLT, largely improving tumor coverage from 75.0% (0 mm margin) to 97.9% in average, while minimizing normal tissue toxicity. With the goal of prescribed dose 5 Gy covering 95% of PTVQBLT, QBLT-guided 7-field conformal RT can effectively irradiate 99.4 ± 1.0% of GTV. Conclusions: The QBLT provides a unique opportunity for investigators to use biologic information for target delineation, guiding conformal irradiation, and reducing normal tissue involvement, which is expected to increase reproducibility of scientific discovery. © 2021 The Authors","Elsevier Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Here we show that large-field multifocal illumination fluorescence microscopy and panoramic volumetric multispectral optoacoustic tomography can be combined to longitudinally assess Aβ deposits in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease. We used fluorescent Aβ-targeted probes (the luminescent conjugated oligothiophene HS-169 and the oxazine-derivative AOI987) to transcranially detect Aβ deposits in the cortex of APP/PS1 and arcAβ mice with single-plaque resolution (8 μm) and across the whole brain (including the hippocampus and the thalamus, which are inaccessible by conventional intravital microscopy) at sub-150 μm resolutions. Two-photon microscopy, light-sheet microscopy and immunohistochemistry of brain-tissue sections confirmed the specificity and regional distributions of the deposits. High-resolution multiscale optical and optoacoustic imaging of Aβ deposits across the entire brain in rodents thus facilitates the in vivo study of Aβ accumulation by brain region and by animal age and strain. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Nature Research","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Here, we designed an oral multiparticulate system to achieve targeted release in the colon. In this sense, chitosan nanoparticles (CS NPs) encapsulated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and incorporated into retrograded starch and pectin (RS/P) microparticles were developed and their in vivo distribution along the mouse GIT after oral administration was monitored using multispectral optical imaging. In vitro release studies revealed that the encapsulation of CS NPs into RS/P microparticles promoted greater control of 5-FU release rates, with a significant reduction (53%) in acid media that might replicate that found in the stomach following oral administration. The evaluation of the in vivo biodistribution of the CS NPs in mice showed a faster clearance in the distribution pattern along the mouse GIT, i.e., a shorter transit time of CS NPs compared to CS NPs-loaded RS/P microparticles. Additionally, CS NPs alone showed non-specific absorption into the blood-stream with associated kidney accumulation, while for the CS NPs-loaded RS/P microparticles no significant accumulation was observed in blood or major clearance organs. This suggests the specific degradability of RS/P by the colon microbiota appears to have been decisive in the higher protection of the CS NPs along the GIT until release in the colon, preventing unwanted absorption into the bloodstream and major organs following oral administration. Our findings represent a proof of concept for the use of RS/P microparticles as potential carriers for delivering drug-loaded nanoparticles to the colon and this work will contribute to the development of oral-systems for colorectal cancer therapy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Elsevier B.V.","Article","","Scopus"

In this review, we discuss common modalities and techniques of vibrational spectroscopy, and present key examples to illustrate how they have been applied to enrich the assessment of connective tissues. In particular, we focus on applications of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), near infrared (NIR) and Raman spectroscopy to assess cartilage and bone properties. We present strengths and limitations of each approach and discuss how the combination of spectrometers with microscopes (hyperspectral imaging) and fiber optic probes have greatly advanced their biomedical applications. We show how these modalities may be used to evaluate virtually any type of sample (ex vivo, in situ or in vivo) and how “spectral fingerprints” can be interpreted to quantify outcomes related to tissue composition and quality. We highlight the unparalleled advantage of vibrational spectroscopy as a label-free and often nondestructive approach to assess properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) associated with normal, developing, aging, pathological and treated tissues.

Noninvasive, multispectral, photoacoustic (PA) techniques use pulsed laser light to induce PA signals to facilitate the visualization of chemical components that are strongly related to tissue health. In this study, the feasibility of multi-wavelength PA (MWPA) measurement of the collagen in bone, using the wavelength range of 1300–1800 nm, was investigated. First, the feasibility of this approach for detecting the collagen content of bone was demonstrated by means of numerical simulation. Then, ex vivo experiments were conducted on both animal and human bone specimens with different bone densities using the MWPA method. The relative collagen content was extracted and compared with the results of micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and histology. The results showed that the “relative collagen content” parameter obtained using the MWPA approach correlated well with the bone volume ratio obtained from micro-CT images and histological analysis results.

Recently, Photonic technologies play a vital role in medical applications. This study presents an outline of recent outcomes on the magnitude of breast tissue optical properties. We established an optical system setup utilizing a hyperspectral (HS) camera with poly-chromatic source lights with wavelength (380~1050 nm) for this investigation. Measuring the diffuse reflection (Rd) of the investigated ex vivo breast sample to select the optimum spectral image to differentiate between the normal and tumor in the near infra-red and visible (NIR-VIS) spectrum. Finally, applying the custom algorithm to increase the image contrast and applying contour delineation of the malignant regions. The experimental analysis indicates key spectroscopic variations between normal tissue and malignant region in range (550~650 nm). Although, after data normalization, there was noticeable variation at three ranges (630-680 nm), (720-770 nm), and (830-880 nm). The calculated standard deviation (Şd) between the normal and cancer tissue to validate the selective ranges shows that the highest contrast at wavelength 680 nm. However, the histogram analysis illustrates that the spectral image at 600 nm was higher contrast and wavelength 400 nm was the lowest contrast from the select seven-spectral images (400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000 nm) to avoid the processing time of the captured HS 128-frames. The proposed potential method could provide promising results on the investigated breast sample optical properties in the diagnostic applications to assist the pathologist and the surgeon.

Although there are some research reports involving fluorescent probes for imaging NQO1 in vivo, they generally suffer from the strong light scattering by tissues which would cause the spatial resolution of fluorescent signals degrade rapidly with imaging depth. On the other hand, as an emerging detection and imaging modality, optoacoustic tomography (OAT) is capable of providing more detailed information in deep biological tissues than fluorescent imaging, since in OAT ultrasound signals are the reporting signals. To overcome the inherent defects of fluorescent imaging, in this work, we developed a novel near-infrared (NIR) NQO1-activatable optoacoustic (OA) probe TPA-X-Q based on the push-pull internal charge transfer (ICT) scaffold. TPA-X-Q consists of a NQO1-responsive moiety, quinone propionate group and a NIR chromophore TPA-X-OH. In the absence of the enzyme NQO1, the probe displays nearly no noticeable OA signal upon NIR excitation. Whereas in the presence of NQO1, the quinone propionate group of TPA-X-Q is reduced and cleaved by the enzymatic reaction triggered by NQO1, and thus TPA-X-Q is transformed into TPA-X-OH, consequently evident OA signal is generated, thereby realizing the detection and imaging of NQO1. As for the probe, the limit of detection (LOD) is determined to be 0.193 μg•mL -1. Furthermore, the probe TPA-X-Q displays several advantages, such as quite good selectivity towards NQO1, low cytotoxicity and excellent photostability. Moreover, the probe has been successfully utilized to detect and image the overexpressed NQO1 in the breast cancer-bearing mouse model. Orthogonal-view three-dimensional (3D) images can also be obtained by using multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), and thus precise localization of the breast cancer tumors can be achieved. This probe holds great potential for being employed as an efficacious tool for diagnosing breast cancer via responding to NQO1. © 2021 Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Science Press","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

Nevertheless, a tumor type dependent differential response was observed. Although an improved and more selective tumor accumulation of pHPMA-Dox is generally achieved due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, little is known about the fate of these conjugates upon entering the tumor tissue, which could explain the different responses. In this study, we compared in vitro and in vivo accumulation and Dox-activation of pHPMA-Dox in three cancer cell line models (1411HP, A2780cis, HT29) and derived xenografttumors using a near-infrared fluorescence-labeledpHPMA-Dox conjugate. Firstly, cytotoxicity assays using different pH conditions proved a stepwise, pH-dependent increase in cytotoxic activity and revealed comparable sensitivity among the cell lines. Using multispectral fluorescence microscopy, we were able to track the distribution of drug and polymeric carrier simultaneously on cellular and histological levels. Microscopic analyses of cell monolayers confirmed the assumed mechanism of cell internalization of the whole conjugate followed by intracellular cleavage and nuclear accumulation of Dox in all three cell lines. In contrast, intratumoral distribution and drug release in xenografttumors were completely different and were associated with different tissue substructures and microenvironments analyzed by Azan-and Hypoxisense®-staining. In 1411HP tumors, large vessels and less hypoxic/acidic microenvironments were associated with a pattern resulting from consistent tissue distribution and cellular uptake as whole conjugate followed by intracellular drug release. In A2780cis tumors, an inconsistent pattern of distribution partly resulting from premature drug release was associated with a more hypoxic/acidic microenvironment, compacted tumor tissue with compressed vessels and specific pre-damaged tissue structures. A completely different distribution pattern was observed in HT29 tumors, resulting from high accumulation of polymer in abundant fibrotic structures, with small embedded vessels featuring this tumor type together with pronounced premature drug release due to the strongly hypoxic/acidic microenvironment. In conclusion, the pattern of intratumoral distribution and drug release strongly depends on the tumor substructure and microenvironment and may result in different degrees of therapeutic efficacy. This reflects the pronounced heterogeneity observed in the clinical application of nanomedicines and can be exploited for the future design of such conjugates. © 2020 by the authors.Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","MDPI AG","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Different types of light sources can be used for the imaging. Design of laser-based illuminators is more complicated and, consequently, they are more expensive than LED-based illuminators. On the other hand, spectral line illumination has the advantage of less complicated calculations, since only the discrete maximum wavelengths need to be considered. Spectral band and spectral line approaches for multispectral skin diagnostics have not been compared so far. This can help to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of both approaches. Aim: To compare two specific illumination modalities - spectral band and spectral line illumination - from the point of performance for mapping of in vivo skin chromophores. Approach: Three spectral images of the same skin malformations were captured by a smartphone RGB camera with two different add-on illuminators comprising LED emitters and laser emitters, respectively. Five types of benign skin neoplasms were included in our study. Concentrations of skin melanin, oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin at image pixel groups were calculated using the Beer-Lambert law. Results: Skin chromophore maps and statistical analysis of mean concentrations' changes in the neoplasms compared to the surrounding skin are presented and discussed. The data of the laser emitters led to significantly higher (∼10 times) increase of the oxy-hemoglobin values in vascular neoplasms and much lower deoxy-hemoglobin values, if compared to the data obtained by the LED emitters. Conclusions: Analysis of the obtained chromophore distribution maps and concentration variations in neoplasms led to conclusion that the spectral line illumination approach is more appropriate for this application. Considering only the peak wavelengths of illumination spectral bands leads to essentially different results if compared to those obtained by spectral line illumination and may cause misinterpretations in the clinical assessment of skin neoplasms.  © 2021 The Authors.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating gas plasma-aided cell adhesion and matrix remodeling essential for wound closure remain elusive. Here, we combined in vitro analyses in primary dermal fibroblasts isolated from murine skin with in vivo studies in a murine wound model to demonstrate that gas plasma treatment changed phosphorylation of signaling molecules such as focal adhesion kinase and paxillin α in adhesion-associated complexes. In addition to cell spreading and migration, gas plasma exposure affected cell surface adhesion receptors (e.g., integrinα5β1, syndecan 4), structural proteins (e.g., vinculin, talin, actin), and transcription of genes associated with differentiation markers of fibroblasts-to-myofibroblasts and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cellular protrusions, fibronectin fibrillogenesis, matrix metabolism, and matrix metalloproteinase activity. Finally, we documented that gas plasma exposure increased tissue oxygenation and skin perfusion during ROS-driven wound healing.

Especially, brain can be seriously affected by the oxygen deficiency. However, challenges exist in optically monitoring cerebral hemodynamics with high resolution. As an easily-detected vessel bed, peripheral skin is a potential target for predicting cerebrovascular hemodynamic changes. However, the similarities and differences between cerebral and cutaneous hemodynamics during hypoxia are still unclear. One of the main reasons is that optical imaging techniques are fundamentally depth/resolution-limited due to high scattering properties of turbid tissue. Fortunately, in vivo tissue optical clearing techniques can efficiently overcome these problems, and avoid the side-effects of surgical windows. In this work, we simultaneously monitor the changes in cortical and cutaneous microvascular blood oxygen and blood flow under the assistance of in vivo skull and skin optical clearing techniques, and quantitatively compared the differences between cerebral and cutaneous arteriovenous functional responses to the hypoxic stimulus. The results indicated that the variation tendency of blood oxygen response might be more similar, and cutaneous vascular blood oxygen response has the potential to serve as an accessible indicator for revealing cerebrovascular dysfunction. Moreover, it provides a feasible approach to realize visualization of in vivo monitoring cerebral and cutaneous microvascular reactivity with minimal invasiveness.  © 1995-2012 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Consequently, many innovative endoscopic diagnostic techniques have succeeded in detection, characterization, and confirmation: the three critical steps for routine endoscopic diagnosis. In this review, we mainly summarize researches on emerging endoscopic optical diagnostic techniques, with emphasis on recent advances. We also introduce the fundamental principles and the development of those techniques and compare their characteristics. Especially, we shed light on the merit of novel endoscopic imaging technologies in medical research. For example, hyperspectral imaging and Raman spectroscopy provide direct molecular information, while optical coherence tomography and multi-photo endomicroscopy offer a more extensive detection range and excellent spatial–temporal resolution. Furthermore, we summarize the unexplored application fields of these endoscopic optical techniques in major hospital departments for biomedical researchers. Finally, we provide a brief overview of the future perspectives, as well as bottlenecks of those endoscopic optical diagnostic technologies.

Images of 26 tissue samples from 10 patients were included, containing 26,446 data points that were matched to histopathology. Tumorous tissue could be classified with an area under the curve of 0.83, a sensitivity of 0.81, a specificity of 0.70, and Matthew’s correlation coefficient of 0.41. This study paves the way to in vivo and intraoperative use of HSI during CRS. Hyperspectral imaging can scan a whole tissue surface in a fast and non-contact way. Our pilot study demonstrates that HSI and SVM learning can be used to discriminate EOC from surrounding tissue. © 2022 by the authors.

However, coexisting pathologies, such as fibrosis and steatosis, affect R2* measurements and may thus confound HIC estimations. Purpose: To evaluate whether a multispectral auto regressive moving average (ARMA) model can be used in conjunction with quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) to measure magnetic susceptibility as a confounder-free predictor of HIC. Study Type: Phantom study and in vivo cohort. Subjects: Nine iron phantoms covering clinically relevant R2* range (20–1200/second) and 48 patients (22 male, 26 female, median age 18 years). Field Strength/Sequence: Three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) multi-echo gradient echo (GRE) at 1.5 T. Assessment: ARMA-QSM modeling was performed on the complex 3D GRE signal to estimate R2*, fat fraction (FF), and susceptibility measurements. R2*-based dry clinical HIC values were calculated from the 2D GRE acquisition using a published R2*-HIC calibration curve as reference standard. Statistical Tests: Linear regression analysis was performed to compare ARMA R2* and susceptibility-based estimates to iron concentrations and dry clinical HIC values in phantoms and patients, respectively. Results: In phantoms, the ARMA R2* and susceptibility values strongly correlated with iron concentrations (R2 ≥ 0.9). In patients, the ARMA R2* values highly correlated (R2 = 0.97) with clinical HIC values with slope = 0.026, and the susceptibility values showed good correlation (R2 = 0.82) with clinical dry HIC values with slope = 3.3 and produced a dry-to-wet HIC ratio of 4.8. Data Conclusion: This study shows the feasibility that ARMA-QSM can simultaneously estimate susceptibility-based wet HIC, R2*-based dry HIC and FFs from a single multi-echo GRE acquisition. Our results demonstrate that both, R2* and susceptibility-based wet HIC values estimated with ARMA-QSM showed good association with clinical dry HIC values with slopes similar to published R2*-biopsy HIC calibration and dry-to-wet tissue weight ratio, respectively. Hence, our study shows that ARMA-QSM can provide potentially confounder-free assessment of hepatic iron overload. Level of Evidence: 3.

As in the previous year, muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) was the main topic of the congress based upon the rapid evolution in this field over the last several years. This year´s meeting was dominated by presentations focusing on genomic subtyping in MIBC and identification of novel therapeutic targets. These topics were complemented by submissions on immunotherapy, a variety of clinical topics, and biomarker research. Based upon the presentations, it may be concluded that the IBCN increasingly serves as an interdisciplinary forum not only for the presentation of work-in-progress covering all facets of bladder cancer research, but also for catalyzing the discussion of discrepant research findings in an effort to find consensus. The 16th Meeting of the IBCN took place from October 11 to 13th, 2018 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, hosted by Ellen Zwarthoff and Joost Boormans. Approximately 120 participants gathered for another fully packed program displaying recent achievements in basic and clinical research covering the entire spectrum of bladder cancer. This year's meeting was dominated by presentations focusing on genomic subtyping and identification of novel therapeutic targets. These topics were complemented by submissions on immunotherapy, clinical topics, and biomarker research. Keynote lectures were delivered by G. Robertson (Canada) on MIBC genomics and the organizational challenges of the PanCancerAtlas project. Comprehensive information was provided on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project including the structure of the consortium and the development and validation of molecular classification of MIBC. Results from the project suggest that regulons (groups of genes controlled by a common regulator) appear to be correlated with prognosis and may replace gene expression analysis in the future. M. Thelen (Switzerland) discussed the role of chemokines in cancer metastasization reporting on his research on the atypical chemokine receptor 3. The inaugural IBCN lecture was presented by M. Ingersoll (France) discussing gender disparities in development of adaptive immunity following Bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy. In addition to the traditional “Industry meets IBCN” sessions, a format for discussion between industry representatives, researchers, and physicians in break-out groups, new formats were introduced—in the Oxford style of debate, P.J. Goebell (Germany) and W. Stadler (USA) delivered animated discussion on the appropriateness of urologists administering systemic immune checkpoint inhibitors. There was consensus that practice may differ between different health systems and countries, and educational/training background. In a second interesting discussion, D. McConkey (USA) and H. Al-Ahmadie (USA) debated if traditional histology will be replaced by molecular classification of bladder tumors. It was concluded that molecular classification offers valuable additional information but cannot yet replace traditional histology. Furthermore, the growing evidence of tumor heterogeneity in bladder cancer was discussed in a separate topic session. L. Dyrskjot discussed genomic and transcriptomic heterogeneity and their impact on clinical decision making. G. Sjödahl presented data on heterogeneity of molecular subtypes within the primary tumor and between the primary tumor and metastases, that is surprisingly limited. Y. Allory discussed spatial and temporal heterogeneity of bladder cancers particularly focusing on the basal-like phenotype. Due to the continued increase in the number of participants and abstract submissions, a poster session was implemented at this year´s meeting for the first time. Posters were briefly presented in the forum. Two travel awards were presented to H. Yamashita (USA) for his submission on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma-mediated repression of transcription factor activating protein 2 alfa expression identifying a transcriptional circuit in basal-squamous bladder cancer in a cell line model. S.B. Williams (USA) received his award for his registry-based analysis of outcome and costs in patients with localized MIBC undergoing either bladder sparing trimodal therapy or radical cystectomy. The latter was found to generate improved survival outcomes at lower costs as compared with trimodal therapy. The best presentation awards were presented to A. Kamoun (France) who discussed a consensus molecular classification for MIBC. The international demand for a consensus classification, already raised at previous meetings, has resonated with important players in this field. A potential consensus comprising 6 classes was proposed based upon a thorough analysis of the existing classifications. As an extension of the IBCN meeting a consensus conference on genomic classification of MIBC was held that included all major groups in this field. M. Garige (USA) received his award for a detailed examination of inhibitors of metabolic processes in bladder cancer cells before and after therapy. A take home message of the meeting was that the IBCN increasingly serves as an interdisciplinary forum not for the presentation of work-in-progress covering all facets of bladder cancer research, but also for catalyzing the discussion of discrepant research findings in an effort to find consensus. Exemplified may this also be by the fact that the efforts to unify the subclassification of MIBC had its nidus on the preceding meetings of the IBCN on this topic and brought together the various disciplines which ultimately were able to finalize their consensus work in a last concluding meeting directly following the IBCN. Thus, the IBCN meetings and the close cooperation of IBCN with its official journal, Urological Oncology, continue to provide a unique platform for exchange, discussing and intensifying multidimensional collaborations, thus finally satisfying the increasing need for answers regarding the management of bladder cancer patients. The 17th meeting of the IBCN will take place in Aarhus, Denmark, October 3 to 5, 2019. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Elsevier Inc.","Review","","Scopus"

High-resolution imaging of tau deposits at the whole-brain scale in animal disease models is highly desired. Methods: We approached this challenge by non-invasively imaging the brains of P301L mice of 4-repeat tau with concurrent volumetric multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (vMSOT) at ~ 115 μm spatial resolution using the tau-targeted pyridinyl-butadienyl-benzothiazole derivative PBB5 (i.v.). In vitro probe characterization, concurrent vMSOT and epi-fluorescence imaging of in vivo PBB5 targeting (i.v.) was performed in P301L and wild-type mice, followed by ex vivo validation using AT-8 antibody for phosphorylated tau. Results: PBB5 showed specific binding to recombinant K18 tau fibrils by fluorescence assay, to post-mortem Alzheimer’s disease brain tissue homogenate by competitive binding against [11C]PBB3 and to tau deposits (AT-8 positive) in post-mortem corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy brains. Dose-dependent optoacoustic and fluorescence signal intensities were observed in the mouse brains following i.v. administration of different concentrations of PBB5. In vivo vMSOT brain imaging of P301L mice showed higher retention of PBB5 in the tau-laden cortex and hippocampus compared to wild-type mice, as confirmed by ex vivo vMSOT, epi-fluorescence, multiphoton microscopy, and immunofluorescence staining. Conclusions: We demonstrated non-invasive whole-brain imaging of tau in P301L mice with vMSOT system using PBB5 at a previously unachieved ~ 115 μm spatial resolution. This platform provides a new tool to study tau spreading and clearance in a tauopathy mouse model, foreseeable in monitoring tau targeting putative therapeutics. © 2022, The Author(s).","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Then, the kinetics of the edema development is studied for two models.

For the venous occlusion, a 51% increase in water content is observed with Raman spectroscopy. The differences in water content estimation by three methods are explained based on the light propagation model.

The goals of this study were to evaluate the effect of pre-weaned rat gastric fluids on 50 nm CuO NPs and TiO2 E171 in vitro, and to evaluate uptake in vivo. The NP uptake was studied in vivo in male and female Sprague-Dawley rat pups following oral administration of four consecutive daily doses of 10 mg/kg CuO NPs, TiO2 E171, or vehicle control (water) between postnatal day (PND) 7–10. Rat pups were sacrificed on either PND10 or PND21. Simulated digestion led to dissolution of CuO NPs at the later ages tested (PND14 and PND21, but not PND7). In vivo intestinal uptake of CuO NPs and TiO2 E171 was observed by hyperspectral imaging of intestinal cross sections. Brightfield microscopy showed that the number of immune cells increased in the intestinal tissue following NP administration. Orally administered NPs led to low intestinal uptake of NPs and an increase in immune cells in the small and large intestine, suggesting that oral exposure to NPs during early life may lead to irritation or a low-grade inflammation.

For patients with such tumors, T cell-based immunotherapy alone infrequently results in durable tumor control. Methods Here, we developed experimental models to study mechanisms of T-cell escape and demonstrated that resistance to T-cell killing can be overcome by the addition of natural killer (NK) cells engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). Results In engineered models of tumor heterogeneity, PD-L1 CAR-engineered NK cells (PD-L1 t-haNKs) prevented the clonal selection of T cell-resistant tumor cells observed with T-cell treatment alone in multiple models. Treatment of heterogenous cancer cell populations with T cells resulted in interferon gamma (IFN-γ3) release and subsequent upregulation of PD-L1 on tumor cells that escaped T-cell killing through defects in antigen processing and presentation, priming escape cell populations for PD-L1 dependent killing by PD-L1 t-haNKs in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions These results describe the underlying mechanisms governing synergistic antitumor activity between T cell-based immunotherapy that results in IFN-γproduction, upregulation of PD-L1 on T-cell escape cells, and the use of PD-L1 CAR-engineered NK cells to target and eliminate resistant tumor cell populations.  © ","BMJ Publishing Group","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In this paper, wavelength-coded volume holographic gratings (WC-VHGs) based optical sectioning fluorescence microscopy is proposed to simultaneously offer multi-color fluorescence images with fine out-of-focus background rejection. Due to wavelength degeneracy, multiplexed WC-VHGs are capable of acquiring multi-wavelength fluorescence images in a single shot, and displaying the laterally separated multi-wavelength images onto CCD. In our system optical sectioning capability is achieved through speckle illumination and HiLo imaging method.

Therefore, bright and multispectral NIR-II probes are required and play a key role. Here, we report the synthesis of a set of bright rare-earth based NIR-II downshifting nanoparticles (DSNPs) with hexagonal phase (β phase). As compared with the widely reported DSNPs (β-NaYF4@NaYF4:20Yb/(0.5-2)A@NaYF4; A = Ho, Pr, Tm or Er) previously, we reveal that the concentrations of both sensitizers and activators can be further highly doped, not limited by the concentration quenching effect. Our results demonstrate that the optimized formula in the heavily doped DSNPs (β-NaYF4@NaYbF4:A@NaYF4, A = 20Ho, 3Pr, 4Tm or 10Er) leads to 1.2- to 4.2-folds NIR-II luminescence enhancement. Especially for the heavily Er-doped DSNPs with long-wavelength photons extending to the NIR-IIb window (1500-1700 nm), we can further boost their luminescence through introducing a beneficial cross-relaxation and host matrix with higher phonon energy (cubic phase NaYF4@NaYbF4:10Er/5Ce@NaYF4), leading to a total of ∼11.4-fold enhancement. The resulting biocompatible, bright NIR-II emitting DSNPs enable us to in vivo monitor the cerebral vessels through the intact scalp and skull, as well as two-color dynamic tumor imaging with high spatial resolution. This work suggests the potential of the heavily doped DSNPs for multiplexed imaging in cerebrovascular abnormalities toward the diagnosis and therapy of the cerebral diseases. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

While gross total resection improves the prognosis, a supratotal resection may result in neurological deficits. On the other hand, accurate intraoperative identification of the tumor boundaries may be very difficult, resulting in subtotal resections. Histological examination of biopsies can be used repeatedly to help achieve gross total resection but this is not practically feasible due to the turn-around time of the tissue analysis. Therefore, intraoperative techniques to recognize tissue types are investigated to expedite the clinical workflow for tumor resection and improve outcome by aiding in the identification and removal of the malignant lesion. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an optical imaging technique with the power of extracting additional information from the imaged tissue. Because HSI images cannot be visually assessed by human observers, we instead exploit artificial intelligence techniques and leverage a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to investigate the potential of HSI in twelve in vivo specimens. The proposed framework consists of a 3D–2D hybrid CNN-based approach to create a joint extraction of spectral and spatial information from hyperspectral images. A comparison study was conducted exploiting a 2D CNN, a 1D DNN and two conventional classification methods (SVM, and the SVM classifier combined with the 3D–2D hybrid CNN) to validate the proposed network. An overall accuracy of 80% was found when tumor, healthy tissue and blood vessels were classified, clearly outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches. These results can serve as a basis for brain tumor classification using HSI, and may open future avenues for image-guided neurosurgical applications. © 2020 by the authors.

Novel intraoperative imaging modalities have demonstrated great promise for potentially increasing the accuracy and efficiency in surgical margin delineation. In this current study, we collated and analyzed various intraoperative imaging modalities utilized in head and neck cancer to evaluate their use in discriminating malignant from healthy tissues. The authors conducted a systematic database search through PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and EBSCOhost (CINAHL). Study screening and data extraction were performed and verified by the authors, and more studies were added through handsearching. Here, intraoperative imaging modalities are described, including optical coherence tomography, narrow band imaging, autofluorescence, and fluorescent-tagged probe techniques. Available sensitivities and specificities in delineating cancerous from healthy tissues ranged from 83.0% to 100.0% and 79.2% to 100.0%, respectively, across the different imaging modalities. Many of these initial studies are in small sample sizes, with methodological differences that preclude more extensive quantitative comparison. Thus, there is impetus for future larger studies examining and comparing the efficacy of these intraoperative imaging technologies. © 2022 by the authors.","MDPI","Review","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Traditional measures of perfusion assessment rely on clinical judgement and are mainly subjective, based on tissue appearance, leading to variability between clinicians. This paper describes a multispectral imaging (MSI) laparoscope that can derive quantitative measures of tissue oxygen saturation (SO2). The system uses a xenon surgical light source and fast filter wheel camera to capture eight narrow waveband images across the visible range in approximately 0.3 s. Spectral validation measurements were performed by imaging standardised colour tiles and comparing reflectance with ground truth spectrometer data. Tissue spectra were decomposed into individual contributions from haemoglobin, adipose tissue and scattering, using a previously-developed regression approach. Initial clinical results from seven patients undergoing colorectal surgery are presented and used to characterise measurement stability and reproducibility in vivo. Strategies to improve signal-To-noise ratio and correct for motion are described. Images of healthy bowel tissue (in vivo) indicate that baseline SO2 is approximately 75 } 6%. The SO2 profile along a bowel segment following ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) shows a decrease from the proximal to distal end. In the clinical cases shown, imaging results concurred with clinical judgements of the location of well-perfused tissue. Adipose tissue, visibly yellow in the RGB images, is shown to surround the mesentery and cover some of the serosa. SO2 in this tissue is consistently high, with mean value of 90%. These results show that MSI is a potential intraoperative guidance tool for assessment of perfusion. Mapping of SO2 in the colon could be used by surgeons to guide choice of transection points and ensure that well-perfused tissue is used to form an anastomosis. The observation of high mesenteric SO2 agrees with work in the literature and warrants further exploration. Larger studies incorporating with a wider cohort of clinicians will help to provide retrospective evidence of how this imaging technique may be able to reduce inter-operator variability. © 2021 OSA - The Optical Society.

The most important are: excessive extraction of normal (healthy) tissue, and inadvertently leaving small sections of tumor tissue un-resected. This study attempts to help neurosurgeons to accurately determine brain tumor boundaries in the resection process using hyperspectral images. We design real-time classification algorithms to determine the type of tissue located at each pixel using technology that could be made accessible to most hospitals. The pixel classifier function is personalized for each of the 13 in-vivo and in-vitro glioblastoma samples by training in situ working with a region of pixels selected for each label. At a certain point during the resection, the surgeon selects a small area of tumor and healthy tissue from the RGB image and our mathematical model provides the classification map for the full image. We also suggest a personalized separator function for each label in order to find cell families with the hyperspectral signature. Mean intra-patient sensitivity was 89% and 85% for in-vivo and in-vitro samples respectively; however, mean specificity was 96% and 92% respectively. Our model allows the spatial detection of different tumor (or healthy) clones that could be related to phenotype heterogeneity within the brain. We find different vasculature and tumor families within patients which might be related to tumor invasion of the vasculature, and different degrees of tumor malignancy, respectively. © 2020 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Conference paper","","Scopus"

However, the underlying mechanisms of RLIPoC mediating cross-organ protection remain to be fully elucidated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ischemic stroke was induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion for 60 minutes. RLIPoC was performed with 3 cycles of 10-minute ischemia followed by 10-minute reperfusion of the bilateral femoral arteries im-mediately af ter middle cerebral artery reperfusion. The percentage of regulatory T cells ( Tregs) in the spleen, blood, and brain was detected using flow cytometry, and the number of Tregs in the ischemic hemisphere was counted using transgenic mice with an enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged Foxp3. Furthermore, the metabolic status was monitored dynamically using a multispectral optical imaging system. The Tregs were conditionally depleted in the depletion of Treg transgenic mice af ter the injection of the diphtheria toxin. The inflammatory response and neuronal apoptosis were investigated using immunofluorescent staining. Infarct volume and neurological deficits were evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging and the modified neurological severity score, respectively. The results showed that RLIPoC substan-tially reduced infarct volume, improved neurological function, and significantly increased Tregs in the spleen, blood, and ischemic hemisphere af ter middle cerebral artery occlusion. RLIPoC was followed by subsequent alteration in metabo-lites, such as flavin adenine dinucleotide and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrate, both in RLIPoC-conducted local tissues and circulating blood. Furthermore, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrate can mimic RLIPoC in increasing Tregs. Conversely, the depletion of Tregs using depletion of Treg mice compromised the neuroprotective ef fects con-ferred by RLIPoC. CONCLUSIONS: RLIPoC protects against ischemic brain injury, at least in part by activating and maintaining the Tregs through the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrate pathway. © 2021 The Authors.","American Heart Association Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Herein, we propose a convolutional neural network for fluorescence lifetime imaging with compressed sensing at high compression (NetFLICS-CR), which enables in vivo applications at enhanced resolution, acquisition and processing speeds, without the need for experimental training datasets. NetFLICS-CR produces intensity and lifetime reconstructions at 128 × 128 pixel resolution over 16 spectral channels while using only up to 1% of the required measurements, therefore reducing acquisition times from ∼2.5 hours at 50% compression to ∼3 minutes at 99% compression. Its potential is demonstrated in silico, in vitro and for mice in vivo through the monitoring of receptor-ligand interactions in liver and bladder and further imaging of intracellular delivery of the clinical drug Trastuzumab to HER2-positive breast tumor xenografts. The data acquisition time and resolution improvement through NetFLICS-CR, facilitate the translation of single pixel macroscopic flurorescence lifetime imaging (SP-MFLI) for in vivo monitoring of lifetime properties and drug uptake. © 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement","OSA - The Optical Society","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In vivo maFLIM clinical endoscopic images of benign, precancerous, and cancerous lesions from 67 patients were acquired using a novel maFLIM endoscope. Widefield maFLIM feature maps were generated, and statistical analyses were applied to identify maFLIM features providing contrast between dysplastic/cancerous vs. benign oral lesions. A total of 14 spectral and time-resolved maFLIM features were found to provide contrast between dysplastic/cancerous vs. benign oral lesions, representing novel biochemical and metabolic autofluorescence biomarkers of oral epithelial dysplasia and cancer.

The current procedure for melanoma diagnosis is based on dermoscopy, i.e., a qualitative visual inspection of lesions with intrinsic limited diagnostic reliability and reproducibility. Other non-invasive diagnostic techniques may represent valuable solutions to retrieve additional objective information of a lesion. This review aims to compare the diagnostic performance of non-invasive techniques, alternative to dermoscopy, for melanoma detection in clinical settings. A systematic review of the available literature was performed using PubMed, Scopus and Google scholar databases (2010-September 2020). All human, in-vivo, non-invasive studies using techniques, alternative to dermoscopy, for melanoma diagnosis were included with no restriction on the recruited population. The reference standard was histology but dermoscopy was accepted only in case of benign lesions. Attributes of the analyzed studies were compared, and the quality was evaluated using CASP Checklist. For studies in which the investigated technique was implemented as a diagnostic tool (DTA studies), the QUADAS-2 tool was applied. For DTA studies that implemented a melanoma vs. other skin lesions classification task, a meta-analysis was performed reporting the SROC curves. Sixty-two references were included in the review, of which thirty-eight were analyzed using QUADAS-2. Study designs were: clinical trials (13), retrospective studies (10), prospective studies (8), pilot studies (10), multitiered study (1); the remain studies were proof of concept or had undefined study type. Studies were divided in categories based on the physical principle employed by each diagnostic technique. Twenty-nine out of thirty-eight DTA studies were included in the meta-analysis. Heterogeneity of studies' types, testing strategy, and diagnostic task limited the systematic comparison of the techniques. Based on the SROC curves, spectroscopy achieved the best performance in terms of sensitivity (93%, 95% CI 92.8–93.2%) and specificity (85.2%, 95%CI 84.9–85.5%), even though there was high concern regarding robustness of metrics.

Multispectral photoacoustic (PA) imaging fused with linear spectral unmixing is employed to generate 2-D and 3-D maps of tissue chromophores. However, wavelength and depth dependent attenuation of optical fluence leads to nonuniform variations in the spectral behavior of biomolecules affecting the accuracy of conventional linear unmixing methods. To address this, a modified independent component analysis (ICA) model is proposed to construct adaptive and statistically independent components for each chromophore from the given spectral PA data. The model was trained with custom designed multispectral PA imaging simulations consisting of both endogenous (oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin) and exogenous (indocyanine green - ICG) chromophores inside 30 mm deep tissue. End-to-end unsupervised nature of the proposed approach made the process independent of human labeling and outperformed the standard linear spectral unmixing method when tested on a set of simulated phantoms, experimental phantoms, and in vivo mouse imaging data.  © 2017 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Article","","Scopus"

Rapid hyperspectral imaging of large portions of the microcirculatory preparation is critical for understanding the function and regulation of vascular microcirculatory networks. This report presents the application of an off-the-shelf benchtop HSI linear scanning system to acquire larger field-of-view images of microcirculatory preparations. The HSI line detector was displaced perpendicular to the scanning direction to map larger areas, with a rate of displacement determined by the scanning rate and the exposure time. Analysis of the collected image was used to assess dynamic changes in the microcirculation. The system records dynamic changes in microvascular hemoglobin oxygen (HbO2) saturation and vascular morphology during hypoxia and reoxygenation and has similar acquisition speeds to commonly referenced spectral-scanning HSI systems. In addition, the HbO2 saturations collected via HSI closely correlate with those collected by phosphorescence quenching microscopy. The reported system enables dynamic functional imaging of the microcirculation for broad experimental and clinical applications. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study presents a novel bench setup and algorithm to measure intravascular hemoglobin oxygen saturation in microcirculation. Wide-field hyperspectral imaging allows for rapid quantification of intravascular changes in hemoglobin saturation. The method described in this manuscript can expand the understanding of oxygen delivery to tissues in vivo.

During surgery, insufficient tumor margin may lead to local recurrence of cancer. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a promising optical imaging technique for in vivo cancer detection and tumor margin assessment. In this study, a fully convolutional network (FCN) was implemented for tumor detection and margin assessment in hyperspectral images of SCC. The FCN was trained and tested with hyperspectral images of 25 ex vivo SCC surgical specimens from 20 different patients. The network was evaluated per patient and achieved pixel-level tissue classification with an average AUC of 0.88, 0.83 accuracy, 0.84 sensitivity and 0.70 specificity. The 95% Hausdorff distance of assessed tumor margin in 17 patients was less than 2 mm, and the classification time of each tissue specimen took less than 10 seconds.

We investigated whether local rifampin-loaded hydrogel can combat infection and improve healing in a murine model of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) osteomyelitis. A transverse fracture was made at the tibia midshaft of C57BL/6J mice aged 10–12 weeks and stabilized with an intramedullary pin. A total of 1 × 106 colony-forming units (CFU) of MRSA was inoculated. A collagen-based hydrogel containing low-dose (60 μg) and high-dose (300 μg) rifampin was applied before closure. Postoperative treatment response was assessed through bacterial CFU counts from tissue and hardware, tibial radiographs and microcomputed tomography (μCT), immunohistochemistry, and histological analyses. All untreated MRSA-infected fractures progressed to nonunion by 28 days with profuse MRSA colonization. Infected fractures demonstrated decreased soft callus formation on safranin O stain compared to controls. Areas of dense interleukin-1β stain were associated with poor callus formation. High-dose rifampin hydrogels reduced the average MRSA load in tissue (p < 0.0001) and implants (p = 0.041). Low-dose rifampin hydrogels reduced tissue bacterial load by 50% (p = 0.021). Among sterile models, 88% achieved union compared to 0% of those infected. Mean radiographic union scale in tibia scores improved from 6 to 8.7 with high-dose rifampin hydrogel (p = 0.024) and to 10 with combination local/systemic rifampin therapy (p < 0.0001). μCT demonstrated reactive bone formation in MRSA infection. Histology demonstrated restored fracture healing with bacterial elimination. Rifampin-loaded hydrogels suppressed osteomyelitis, prevented implant colonization, and improved healing. Systemic rifampin was more effective at eliminating infection and improving fracture healing. Further investigation into rifampin-loaded hydrogels is required to correlate these findings with clinical efficacy. © 2020 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Among those techniques, photoacoustic imaging (PAI), considered a functional technique, has shown to be promising for the visualization of micromotors in deep tissue with high spatiotemporal resolution as it possesses the molecular specificity of optical methods and the penetration depth of ultrasound. However, the precise maneuvering and function's control of medical micromotors, in particular in living organisms, require both anatomical and functional imaging feedback. Therefore, herein, the use of high-frequency ultrasound and PAI is reported to obtain anatomical and molecular information, respectively, of magnetically-driven micromotors in vitro and under ex vivo tissues. Furthermore, the steerability of the micromotors is demonstrated by the action of an external magnetic field into the uterus and bladder of living mice in real-time, being able to discriminate the micromotors’ signal from one of the endogenous chromophores by multispectral analysis. Finally, the successful loading and release of a model cargo by the micromotors toward non-invasive in vivo medical interventions is demonstrated. © 2021 The Authors.

Current endoscopic methods are not able to efficiently detect and characterize gastric inflammation, leading to a sub-optimal patients’ care. New non-invasive methods are needed. Reflectance mucosal light analysis is of particular interest in this context. The aim of our study was to analyze reflectance light and specific autofluorescence signals, both in humans and in a mouse model of gastritis. Methods: We recruited patients undergoing gastroendoscopic procedure during which reflectance was analysed with a multispectral camera. In parallel, the gastritis mouse model of Helicobacter pylori infection was used to investigate reflectance from ex vivo gastric samples using a spectrometer. In both cases, autofluorescence signals were measured using a confocal microscope. Findings: In gastritis patients, reflectance modifications were significant in near-infrared spectrum, with a decrease between 610 and 725 nm and an increase between 750 and 840 nm. Autofluorescence was also modified, showing variations around 550 nm of emission. In H. pylori infected mice developing gastric inflammatory lesions, we observed significant reflectance modifications 18 months after infection, with increased intensity between 617 and 672 nm. Autofluorescence was significantly modified after 1, 3 and 6 months around 550 and 630 nm. Both in human and in mouse, these reflectance data can be considered as biomarkers and accurately predicted inflammatory state. Interpretation: In this pilot study, using a practical measuring device, we identified in humans, modification of reflectance spectra in the visible spectrum and for the first time in near-infrared, associated with inflammatory gastric states. Furthermore, both in the mouse model and humans, we also observed modifications of autofluorescence associated with gastric inflammation. These innovative data pave the way to deeper validation studies on larger cohorts, for further development of an optical biopsy system to detect gastritis and finally to better surveil this important gastric cancer risk factor.

It works by identifying the absorption spectrum variations from a sequence of photoacoustic images acquired at multiple illumination wavelengths. Due to multispectral acquisition, this inevitably creates a large dataset. To cut down the data volume, sparse sampling methods that reduce the number of detectors have been developed. However, image reconstruction of sparse sampling PAT is challenging because of insufficient angular coverage. During spectral un-mixing, these inaccurate reconstructions will further amplify imaging artefacts and contaminate the results. To solve this problem, we present the interlaced sparse sampling (ISS) PAT, a method that involved: 1) a novel scanning-based image acquisition scheme in which the sparse detector array rotates while switching illumination wavelength, such that a dense angular coverage could be achieved by using only a few detectors; and 2) a corresponding image reconstruction algorithm that makes use of an anatomical prior image created from the ISS strategy to guide PAT image computation. Reconstructed from the signals acquired at different wavelengths (angles), this self-generated prior image fuses multispectral and angular information, and thus has rich anatomical features and minimum artefacts. A specialized iterative imaging model that effectively incorporates this anatomical prior image into the reconstruction process is also developed. Simulation, phantom, and in vivo animal experiments showed that even under 1/6 or 1/8 sparse sampling rate, our method achieved comparable image reconstruction and spectral un-mixing results to those obtained by conventional dense sampling method.","NLM (Medline)","Article","","Scopus"

By comparing 600 spectra from thirty-six fresh frozen (n=18) and FFPE breast tissue samples (n=18), including Healthy tissue, Ductal Carcinoma In Situ, and Invasive Ductal Carcinoma tissue, the results demonstrated that the dewaxing process significantly altered the biochemical composition of the tissues, particularly lipids, proteins, and carotenoids. Even though, the analytical result proved that commonly used multivariate analysis methods, including principal component analysis - linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA) and partial least squares- discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), could still distinguish the investigated tissue types effectively with satisfying overall accuracy in which PCA-LDA is 88.3 %, PLS-DA is 93.0 %. Therefore, this study confirmed that FFPE sections have diagnostic potential with multivariate analytical model provided that the biochemical changes, meanwhile tissue processing should be aware. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Elsevier B.V.","Article","","Scopus"

The rapid rise of this disease in the last decades is deemed increasingly alarming as it has left deleterious effects not only on affected patients but also on the society and nation. This paper aims to develop a reliable diagnostic tool to address the tremendous need for coordinated and efficient DFU management via prediction of transcutaneous oxygen saturation (StO2) and relative blood perfusion ( τ ) in the affected limb. This system integrates the use of a multispectral imaging and laser speckle contrast imaging technique for two-dimensional (2D) mapping of tissue oxygen and blood perfusion level in ulcerated foot. Longitudinal study revealed a slightly higher mean StO2 and τ level in healed ulcer than in impaired healing, despite the data indicating no statistical significance between these two groups (p-value>0.05). It was observed that a mean StO2 of at least 70 % and τ value of 1.5 (× 103 ) are necessary during the proliferative phase to ensure progressive healing. Based on these findings, this study concluded that high tissue oxygenation and perfusion levels are pivotal to ensure progressive wound healing. This work provides a rationale for evaluating the healing outcomes of skin grafting procedures in diabetic ulcers based on observation of quantitative changes in blood perfusion and tissue oxygen level during its revascularization phase.  © 2013 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Article","","Scopus"

Here we meet these challenging objectives for multispectral fluorescence microscopy, combining hyperspectral phasors and linear unmixing to create Hybrid Unmixing (HyU). HyU is efficient and robust, capable of quantitative signal separation even at low illumination levels. In dynamic imaging of developing zebrafish embryos and in mouse tissue, HyU was able to cleanly and efficiently unmix multiple fluorescent labels, even in demanding volumetric timelapse imaging settings. HyU permits high dynamic range imaging, allowing simultaneous imaging of bright exogenous labels and dim endogenous labels.

It may improve the detection of bladder tumors. However, rMSI has not been used for transurethral biopsy or resection so far. The aim of this ex vivo study was to test the feasibility of bladder tumor biopsies using the rMSI system and compare it to a conventional endoscopic system. Methods: A 3D printed rigid bladder phantom was equipped with small and flat (5 mm × 1 mm) mock-bladder-tumors made of silicone and fluorescent Qdots655 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany). Urologists (n=15) were asked to perform a rigid cystoscopy and biopsy of all identified lesions (n=6) using a prototype rMSI system and the Image1 S system (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen). Success rate and completion time were measured. The image quality of both systems and the usability of the rMSI system according to the system usability scale (SUS) were evaluated with a task-specific questionnaire. Results: Tumor detection and biopsy rate were 100% (90/90) for the rMSI system and 98.9% (89/90) for the Image1 S system (P=0.3). The biopsy completion time did not differ significantly between the systems (P=0.48). Differentiation between healthy and suspect mucosa with the rMSI system was rated as comparable to the Image1 S system by 53% of surgeons and as better by 33% of the surgeons. The median SUS score for the rMSI system was 87.5%. Conclusions: Accurate transurethral biopsies are feasible with the rMSI system. Furthermore, the rMSI system has an excellent SUS.

Conventionally, because the photons detected at each pixel are distributed across as many as 200 energy channels, energy-selective images are characterised by low count-rates and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This means high X-ray exposures, long scan times and high doses are required to image unique spectral markers. Here, we achieve high quality energy-dispersive tomograms from low dose, noisy datasets using a dedicated iterative reconstruction algorithm. This exploits the spatial smoothness and inter-channel structural correlation in the spectral domain using two carefully chosen regularisation terms. For a multi-phase phantom, a reduction in scan time of 36 times is demonstrated. Spectral analysis methods including K-edge subtraction and absorption step-size fitting are evaluated for an ex vivo, single (iodine)-stained biological sample, where low chemical concentration and inhomogeneous distribution can affect soft tissue segmentation and visualisation. The reconstruction algorithms are available through the open-source Core Imaging Library. Taken together, these tools offer new capabilities for visualisation and elemental mapping, with promising applications for multiply-stained biological specimens. © 2021, The Author(s).","Nature Research","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

As an important step towards making PAI clinically available, we present a study in which PAI was used to estimate the spatial distribution of sO2 in vivo during and after occlusion of the finger of eight healthy volunteers. The results were compared with a commercial oxygen saturation monitor based on diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.

Platelets play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and proliferative vascular changes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether human platelets are able to induce transplant arteriosclerosis in a humanized C57/Bl6-Rag2-/-γc-/-mouse xenograft model. Methods. Nonactivated and in vitro-activated human platelets were analyzed and phenotyped for surface markers by flow cytometry. Side branches of human mammary arteries were implanted into the infrarenal aorta of recipients, followed by daily application of human platelets and histological analyzed on day 30 after transplantation. Results. Human platelets collected by apheresis had low levels of platelet activation markers. However, after in vitro activation, expression was markedly increased. Sixty minutes after injection in recipient mice, nonactivated human platelets become significantly activated. Increased adhesion of platelets to the vascular endothelium was detected by in vivo fluorescence microscopy. After intravenous injection of nonactivated or activated platelets, human xenografts showed pronounced intimal proliferation. Immunohistological analysis showed that the group treated with activated human platelets exhibited significantly increased intragraft protein expression of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta and smooth muscle cell migration into the neointima. Conclusions. These data demonstrate that an isolated daily application of both in vivo- and in vitro-activated human platelets results in the development of transplant arteriosclerosis in a humanized mouse transplantation model. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

This is the first study translating intraoperative HSI to an in vivo laparoscopic setting using a CE-certified HSI-system for minimally invasive surgery (HSI-MIS). We aim to compare it to an established HSI-system for open surgery (HSI-Open). Methods: Intraoperative HSI was done using the HSI-MIS and HSI-Open at the Region of Interest (ROI). 19 patients undergoing gastrointestinal resections were analyzed in this study. The HSI-MIS-acquired images were aligned with those from the HSI-Open, and spectra and parameter images were compared pixel-wise. We calculated the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for Tissue Oxygen Saturation (StO2), Near-Infrared Perfusion Index (NIR-PI), Tissue Water Index (TWI), and Organ Hemoglobin Index (OHI), as well as the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) over the whole spectrum. Our analysis of parameters was optimized using partial least squares (PLS) regression. Two experienced surgeons carried out an additional color-change analysis, comparing the ROI images and deciding whether they provided the same (acceptable) or different visual information (rejected). Results: HSI and subsequent image registration was possible in 19 patients. MAE results for the original calculation were StO2 orig. 17.2% (± 7.7%), NIR-PIorig. 16.0 (± 9.5), TWIorig. 18.1 (± 7.9), OHIorig. 14.4 (± 4.5). For the PLS calculation, they were StO2 PLS 12.6% (± 5.2%), NIR-PIPLS 10.3 (± 6.0), TWIPLS 10.6 (± 5.1), and OHIPLS 11.6 (± 3.0). The RMSE between both systems was 0.14 (± 0.06). In the color-change analysis; both surgeons accepted more images generated using the PLS method. Conclusion: Intraoperative HSI-MIS is a new technology and holds great potential for future applications in surgery. Parameter deviations are attributable to technical differences and can be reduced by applying improved calculation methods. This study is an important step toward the clinical implementation of HSI for minimally invasive surgery. © 2023, The Author(s).","Springer","Article","","Scopus"

Although CO-oximetry can be used to monitor the response to treatment for methemoglobinemia, it is costly and requires an invasive procedure for collecting blood samples from patients. A pulse CO-oximeter with a contact probe can be used to continuously and non-invasively measure the percentage of methemoglobin, as well as the percutaneous oxygen saturation. In terms of the prevention of infectious diseases, however, it is desirable to monitor methemoglobin and oxygen saturation levels in a non-contact manner. Diffuse reflectance spectral imaging is promising as a non-contact, non-invasive, and cost-effective clinical diagnostic tool for methemoglobinemia. Aim: To demonstrate the feasibility of visible spectral diffuse reflectance for in vivo monitoring of hemoglobin derivatives and evaluating methemoglobin production and reduction as well as hypoxemia during methemoglobinemia in rats. Approach: A new imaging approach based on the multiple regression analysis aided by Monte Carlo simulations for light transport was developed to quantify methemoglobin, oxygenated hemoglobin, and deoxygenated hemoglobin using a hyperspectral imaging system. An in vivo experiment with rats exposed to sodium nitrite (NaNO2) at different doses was performed to confirm the feasibility of the method for evaluating the dynamics of methemoglobin, oxygenated hemoglobin, and deoxygenated hemoglobin during methemoglobinemia. Systemic physiological parameters, including the percutaneous arterial oxygen saturation, heart rate (HR), and pulse distention, were measured by a commercially available pulse oximeter, and the results were compared to those obtained by the proposed method. Results: Both the methemoglobin concentration and methemoglobin saturation rapidly increased with a half-maximum time of <20 min. They reached their maximal values nearly 60 min after the administration of NaNO2. Tissue oxygen saturation dramatically dropped to a minimum of 33.7 % ± 0.4 %, 23.1 % ± 5.6 %, 8.8 % ± 1.7 %, and 9.7 % ± 5.1 % on average for NaNO2 doses of 25, 37.5, 50, and 75 mg/kg, respectively. Changes in methemoglobin concentration and tissue oxygen saturation are indicative of the temporary production of methemoglobin and severe hypoxemia during methemoglobinemia. Profound increases in the HR and pulse distention implied an elevated cardiac output caused by tachycardia and the resultant increase in peripheral blood volume to compensate for the hypoxia and hypoxemia during methemoglobinemia. This was in agreement with the time course of the peripheral hemoglobin volume concentration obtained by the proposed method. Conclusions: The proposed method is capable of the in vivo non-contact simultaneous evaluation of methemoglobin levels and hypoxemia during methemoglobinemia, and that it has potential as a tool for the diagnosis and management of methemoglobinemia.  © The Authors.

However, correctly predicting the volume of the subsequent tissue destruction during the Thermal Ablation technique is a difficult undertaking. Objective: To examine the impacts of ablation zone volume following Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of an ex-vivo bovine liver to correlate the impacts of thermal ablation with target organ perfusion; by exploiting the unique properties of Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI). Materials and methods: Radiofrequency ablation was perfused on ex-vivo bovine livers at peripheral and central‑vessel‑adjacent locations, and monitored by HSI with a spectral range from 400 to 1000 nm. The system contains k-means clustering (K = 8) algorithms combining spectral and spatial information. Labeled spectral signatures datasets were used as training data. Statistical analysis (10 samples) was computed to calculate the highest variance between six spectral images for determining the optimum wavelength for discrimination between the affected regions after thermal ablation (normal, thermal, and ablated liver tissue regions). Results: The change of the optical properties ofex-vivo liver tissues provides different responses to light transmission, scattering, absorption and particularly the reflection over the spectrum range. The produced spectral image from reflection with the highest variance (358.07) empowered us to determine the optimum wavelength spectral image (720 ± 18.92 nm) to distinguish between the normal, ablated, and thermal categories. Conclusion: Hyperspectral imaging is a powerful tool in monitoring tissue characterization, which is a useful technique for edge evaluation of liver thermal ablation .. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Elsevier B.V.","Article","","Scopus"

We have undertaken the first in vivo evaluation of KGP265, a water-soluble pro-drug of a benzosuberene-based tubulin-binding agent, and found promising vascular-disrupting activity in three distinct tumor types. Dose escalation in orthotopic MDA-MB-231-luc breast tumor xenografts in mice indicated that higher doses produced more effective vascular shutdown, as re-vealed by dynamic bioluminescence imaging (BLI). In syngeneic orthotopic 4T1-luc breast and RENCA-luc kidney tumors, dynamic BLI and oxygen enhanced multispectral optoacoustic tomog-raphy (OE-MSOT) were used to compare vascular shutdown following the administration of KGP265 (7.5 mg/kg). The BLI signal and vascular oxygenation response (ΔsO2) to a gas breathing challenge were both significantly reduced within 2 h, indicating vascular disruption, which contin-ued over 24 h. A correlative histology confirmed increased necrosis and hemorrhage. Twice-weekly doses of KGP265 caused significant growth delay in both MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 breast tumors, with no obvious systemic toxicity. A combination with carboplatin produced significantly greater tumor growth delay than carboplatin alone, though significant carboplatin-associated toxicity was observed (whole-body weight loss). KGP265 was found to be effective at low concentrations, generat-ing long-term vascular shutdown and tumor growth delay, thus providing strong rationale for fur-ther development, particularly in combination therapies. © 2021 by the authors.

As a result, decisions with potentially life-changing consequences for patients are still based on the surgeon's subjective visual assessment. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides a promising solution for objective intraoperative tissue characterisation, with the advantages of being non-contact, non-ionising and non-invasive. However, while its potential to aid surgical decision-making has been investigated for a range of applications, to date no real-time intraoperative HSI (iHSI) system has been presented that follows critical design considerations to ensure a satisfactory integration into the surgical workflow. By establishing functional and technical requirements of an intraoperative system for surgery, we present an iHSI system design that allows for real-time wide-field HSI and responsive surgical guidance in a highly constrained operating theatre. Two systems exploiting state-of-the-art industrial HSI cameras, respectively using linescan and snapshot imaging technology, were designed and investigated by performing assessments against established design criteria and ex vivo tissue experiments. Finally, we report the use of our real-time iHSI system in a clinical feasibility case study as part of a spinal fusion surgery. Our results demonstrate seamless integration into existing surgical workflows.  © 2021 The Author(s).

Our work analyzes the optical properties of visible structures in the surgical field for automatic tissue categorization. Approach: Building an HSI-based computer-aided tissue analysis system requires accurate ground truth and validation of optical soft tissue properties as these show large variability. We introduce and validate two different hyperspectral intraoperative imaging setups and their use for the analysis of optical tissue properties. First, we present an improved multispectral filter-wheel setup integrated into a fully digital microscope. Second, we present a novel setup of two hyperspectral snapshot cameras for intraoperative usage. Both setups are operating in the spectral range of 400 up to 975 nm. They are calibrated and validated using the same database and calibration set. Results: For validation, a color chart with 18 well-defined color spectra in the visual range is analyzed. Thus the results acquired with both settings become transferable and comparable to each other as well as between different interventions. On patient data of two different otorhinolaryngology procedures, we analyze the optical behaviors of different soft tissues and show a visualization of such different spectral information. Conclusion: The introduced calibration pipeline for different HSI setups allows comparison between all acquired spectral information. Clinical in vivo data underline the potential of HSI as an intraoperative diagnostic tool and the clinical usability of both introduced setups. Thereby, we demonstrate their feasibility for the in vivo analysis and categorization of different human soft tissues.  © The Authors.

Ung−/− mice develop B-cell lymphoma (BCL). However, since UNG has anti- and pro-oncogenic activities, its tumor suppressor relevance is unclear. Moreover, how the constant DNA damage and repair caused by the AID and UNG interplay affects B-cell fitness and thereby the dynamics of cell populations in vivo is unknown. Here, we show that UNG specifically protects the fitness of germinal center B cells, which express AID, and not of any other B-cell subset, coincident with AID-induced telomere damage activating p53-dependent checkpoints. Consistent with AID expression being detrimental in UNG-deficient B cells, Ung−/− mice develop BCL originating from activated B cells but lose AID expression in the established tumor. Accordingly, we find that UNG is rarely lost in human BCL. The fitness preservation activity of UNG contingent to AID expression was confirmed in a B-cell leukemia model. Hence, UNG, typically considered a tumor suppressor, acquires tumor-enabling activity in cancer cell populations that express AID by protecting cell fitness. ©C The Author(s) 2020","Oxford University Press","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In this study, we engineered an imaging platform capable of targeting different tumor biomarkers using a multi-colored library of nanoprobes. These probes contain rare-earth elements that emit light in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelength region (900–1700 nm), which exhibits reduced absorption and scattering compared to visible and NIR, and are rendered biocompatible by encapsulation in human serum albumin. The spectrally distinct emissions of the holmium (Ho), erbium (Er), and thulium (Tm) cations that constitute the cores of these nanoprobes make them attractive candidates for optical molecular imaging of multiple disease biomarkers. Methods: SWIR-emitting rare-earth-doped albumin nanocomposites (ReANCs) were synthesized using controlled coacervation, with visible light-emitting fluorophores additionally incorporated during the crosslinking phase for validation purposes. Specifically, HoANCs, ErANCs, and TmANCs were co-labeled with rhodamine-B, FITC, and Alexa Fluor 647 dyes respectively. These Rh-HoANCs, FITC-ErANCs, and 647-TmANCs were further conjugated with the targeting ligands daidzein, AMD3100, and folic acid respectively. Binding specificities of each nanoprobe to distinct cellular subsets were established by in vitro uptake studies. Quantitative whole-body SWIR imaging of subcutaneous tumor bearing mice was used to validate the in vivo targeting ability of these nanoprobes. Results: Each of the three ligand-functionalized nanoprobes showed significantly higher uptake in the targeted cell line compared to untargeted probes. Increased accumulation of tumor-specific nanoprobes was also measured relative to untargeted probes in subcutaneous tumor models of breast (4175 and MCF-7) and ovarian cancer (SKOV3). Preferential accumulation of tumor-specific nanoprobes was also observed in tumors overexpressing targeted biomarkers in mice bearing molecularly-distinct bilateral subcutaneous tumors, as evidenced by significantly higher signal intensities on SWIR imaging. Conclusions: The results from this study show that tumors can be detected in vivo using a set of targeted multispectral SWIR-emitting nanoprobes. Significantly, these nanoprobes enabled imaging of biomarkers in mice bearing bilateral tumors with distinct molecular phenotypes. The findings from this study provide a foundation for optical molecular imaging of heterogeneous tumors and for studying the response of these complex lesions to targeted therapy. © 2020, The Author(s).","BioMed Central Ltd","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Combining multispectral imaging (MSI) with deep learning is a promising approach to increasing tissue discrimination and classification. Evaluating the contributions of spectral channels to tissue discrimination is important for improving MSI systems. Aim: Develop a metric to quantify the contributions of individual spectral channels to tissue classification in MSI. Approach: MSI was integrated into a digital operating microscope with three sensors and seven illuminants. Two convolutional neural network (CNN) models were trained to classify 11 head and neck tissue types using white light (RGB) or MSI images. The signal to noise ratio (SNR) of spectral channels was compared with the impact of channels on tissue classification performance as determined using CNN visualization methods. Results: Overall tissue classification accuracy was higher with use of MSI images compared with RGB images, both for classification of all 11 tissue types and binary classification of nerve and parotid (p < 0.001). Removing spectral channels with SNR > 20 reduced tissue classification accuracy.

CPT1A regulates the entry of fatty acids into the mitochondria for beta-oxidation and its inhibition has been shown to decrease PCa growth. In this study, we examined the pharmacological blockade of lipid oxidation with ranolazine in TRAMPC1 PCa models. Oral administration of ranolazine (100 mg/Kg for 21 days) resulted in decreased tumor CD8+ T-cells Tim3 content, increased macrophages, and decreased blood myeloid immunosuppressive monocytes. Using multispectral staining, drug treatments increased infiltration of CD8+ T-cells and dendritic cells compared to vehicle. Functional studies with spleen cells of drug-treated tumors co-cultured with TRAMPC1 cells showed increased ex vivo T-cell cytotoxic activity, suggesting an anti-tumoral response. Lastly, a decrease in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells expressing PD1 was observed when exhausted spleen cells were incubated with TRAMPC1 Cpt1a-KD compared to the control cells. These data indicated that genetically blocking the ability of the tumor cells to oxidize lipid can change the activation status of the neighboring T-cells.

Even though a range of works have been presented, only a few showed slightly promising results for human tissue, and these were mostly focused on pathological and non-pathological tissue classification. Methods: In this work, several spectral similarity measures on hyperspectral (HS) images of in vivo human tissue were evaluated for tissue discrimination purposes. Moreover, we introduced two new hybrid spectral measures, called SID-JM-TAN(SAM) and SID-JM-TAN(SCA). We analyzed spectral signatures obtained from 13 different human tissue types and two different materials (gauze, instruments), collected from HS images of 100 patients during surgeries. Results: The quantitative results showed the reliable performance of the different similarity measures and the proposed hybrid measures for tissue discrimination purposes. The latter produced higher discrimination values, up to 6.7 times more than the classical spectral similarity measures. Moreover, an application of the similarity measures was presented to support the annotations of the HS images. We showed that the automatic checking of tissue-annotated thyroid and colon tissues was successful in 73% and 60% of the total spectra, respectively. The hybrid measures showed the highest performance. Furthermore, the automatic labeling of wrongly annotated tissues was similar for all measures, with an accuracy of up to 90%. Conclusion: In future work, the proposed spectral similarity measures will be integrated with tools to support physicians in annotations and tissue labeling of HS images. © 2023 by the authors.","MDPI","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Aim: To develop and evaluate a methodology where a snapshot filter mosaic camera is utilized for imaging skin hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SO2), using ANNs. Approach: MSI data were acquired during occlusion provocations. ANNs were trained to estimate SO2 with MSI data as input, targeting data from a validated probe-based reference system. Performance of ANNs with different properties and training data sets was compared. Results: The method enables spatially resolved estimation of skin tissue SO2. Results are comparable to those acquired using a Monte-Carlo-based approach when relevant training data are used. Conclusions: Training an ANN on in vivo MSI data covering a wide range of target values acquired during an occlusion protocol enable real-time estimation of SO2 maps.

This is especially the case in the surgical treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), an optical technology based on light tissue interactions, can potentially characterize tissue during surgery thereby guiding the surgeon intraoperatively. DRS has shown to be able to discriminate pure healthy breast tissue from pure invasive carcinoma (IC) but limited research has been done on (1) the actual optical characteristics of DCIS and (2) the ability of DRS to characterize measurements that are a mixture of tissue types. Methods: In this study, DRS spectra were acquired from 107 breast specimens from 107 patients with proven IC and/or DCIS (1488 measurement locations). With a generalized estimating equation model, the differences between the DRS spectra of locations with DCIS and IC and only healthy tissue were compared to see if there were significant differences between these spectra. Subsequently, different classification models were developed to be able to predict if the DRS spectrum of a measurement location represented a measurement location with “healthy” or “malignant” tissue. In the development and testing of the models, different definitions for “healthy” and “malignant” were used. This allowed varying the level of homogeneity in the train and test data. Results: It was found that the optical characteristics of IC and DCIS were similar. Regarding the classification of tissue with a mixture of tissue types, it was found that using mixed measurement locations in the development of the classification models did not tremendously improve the accuracy of the classification of other measurement locations with a mixture of tissue types. The evaluated classification models were able to classify measurement locations with > 5% malignant cells with a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.41 or 0.40. Some models showed better sensitivity whereas others had better specificity. Conclusion: The results suggest that DRS has the potential to detect malignant tissue, including DCIS, in healthy breast tissue and could thus be helpful for surgical guidance. © 2021, The Author(s).","BioMed Central Ltd","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, noticing or predicting the size of the thermal strategies is a challenging endeavor. We aim to analyze the effects of ablation district volume following radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of ex-vivo liver exploiting a custom Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) system. Materials and methods: RFA was conducted on the ex-vivo bovine liver at focal and peripheral blood vessel sites and observed by Custom HSI system, which has been designed to assess the exactness and proficiency using visible and near-infrared wavelengths region for tissue thermal effect.

In practice, this limited spectral resolution together with the need for multiple excitation wavelengths to excite different fluorophores limits multiphoton microscopy to imaging a few, spectrally distinct fluorescent labels at a time, restricting the complexity of biological processes that can be studied. Here, we demonstrate a hyperspectral multiphoton microscope that utilizes three different wavelength excitation sources together with multiplexed fluorescence emission detection using angle-tuned bandpass filters. This microscope maintains scattering insensitivity, while providing high enough spectral resolution on the emitted fluorescence and capitalizing on the wavelength-dependent nonlinear excitation of fluorescent dyes to enable clean separation of multiple, spectrally overlapping labels, in vivo.We demonstrated the utility of this instrument for spectral separation of closely overlapped fluorophores in samples containing 10 different colors of fluorescent beads, live cells expressing up to seven different fluorescent protein fusion constructs, and in multiple in vivo preparations in mouse cortex and inflamed skin, with up to eight different cell types or tissue structures distinguished.  © 2020 Optical Society of America.","OSA - The Optical Society","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The purpose of the present study is to develop Low cost, commercial, and affordable system that discriminates malignant from normal breast tissues by exploiting the unique properties of Hyperspectral (HS) Imaging. Materials and methods: The difference in the optical properties of the investigated breast tissues gives various reactions to light transmission, absorption, and especially the reflection over the spectral range. A custom optical imaging system (COIS) was designed to assess variable responses to monochromatic LEDs (415, 565, 660 nm) to highlight the differences in the reflectance properties of malignant/normal tissue. Statistical analysis was computed for determining the ideal wavelength to differentiate between normal and malignant regions. The experiment was repeated using the same LEDs, and low-cost CCD camera to examine the capability of such a system to discriminate between normal and malignant tissue. Results: Spectral images obtained by Hyperspectral camera, have been analyzed to reveal the difference of reflectance malignant and normal breast tissue. Superficial spectral reflection image with blue LED (415 nm) showed high variance (10.11). However, a more-depth reflection image with red LED (660 nm) showed low variance (4.44). So the optimum contrast image was produced by combining the three spectral information images from blue, green, and red LED. The COIS using a commercial CCD camera was in agreement with the HS camera. Conclusions: The novel COIS of the commercial Low-cost CCD Camera is reliable and can be used with endoscopy technique as an assistant tool for surgical doctor to make decision and assess the resection edges in real time during surgery. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Elsevier Ltd","Article","","Scopus"

The cyclic recombinase (Cre)-loxP system is commonly used for gene manipulation at desired times and places. However, specificity is dependent on the availability of tissue- or cell-specific regulatory elements used in combination with Cre. Here, we present CreLite, an optogenetically controlled Cre system using red light in developing zebrafish embryos. Results: Cre activity is disabled by splitting Cre and fusing with the Arabidopsis thaliana red light-inducible binding partners, PhyB and PIF6. Upon red light illumination, the PhyB-CreC and PIF6-CreN fusion proteins come together in the presence of the cofactor phycocyanobilin (PCB) to restore Cre activity. Red light exposure of zebrafish embryos harboring a Cre-dependent multicolor fluorescent protein reporter injected with CreLite mRNAs and PCB resulted in Cre activity as measured by the generation of multispectral cell labeling in several different tissues. Conclusions: Our data show that CreLite can be used for gene manipulations in whole embryos or small groups of cells at different developmental stages, and suggests CreLite may also be useful for temporal and spatial control of gene expression in cell culture, ex vivo organ culture, and other animal models. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","John Wiley and Sons Inc","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

PDT uses photosensitizer (PS), the light of a specific wavelength, and molecular oxygen to produce highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), which causes cell death via different mechanisms such as vessel constriction, immunological response, and cell damage by apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis pathways. Fundamental studies of PDT suggest that ROS yield can be affected by various factors such as transportation efficiency and tumor-targeting ability of PSs, illumination strategy of excitation sources, oxygen supply or dependence of the ROS-generation process, and combination with other therapeutic methods, hence directly determining the therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, the relationship between treatment dose and PDT efficacy is still under investigation. The evaluation for PDT indirectly but considerably affects the PDT efficacy by accurately monitoring dosimetric parameters of PDT, which is followed by efficiently regulating and upgrading the therapeutic scheme. In this study, the recent advances in PSs, light sources, tissue oxygenation, synergistic treatment, and dosimetry for improving the clinical PDT efficacy are summarized. Progress Several novel PSs such as C60, black phosphorus, graphene quantum dots, and PSs with aggregation-induced emission, have been developed to improve the quantum yield of 102 • The delivery efficiency of PSs has been improved by different PS delivery strategies and the tumor-microenvironment-responsive release scheme. PS absorption has been enhanced by organelle targeting and photochemical internalization, and PS hypoxia resistance has been resolved through loading with oxygen carriers or oxygen-generating reactants. Further, PS development with the synergistic therapeutic function will be used to enhance PDT efficacy. As for PDT excitation sources, solar light, broad-spectrum lamps, lasers, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), X-ray sources, ultrasonic sources, and in vivo self-excited light sources capable of bioluminescence, chemiluminescence and Cherenkov light, have been widely studied. LEDs and lasers are the most popular light sources in clinical practice. Particularly, wearable, implantable, and disposable PDT light sources have progressed significantly because of the development of inorganic LED arrays, flexible LEDs, and wireless-driven LEDs. Further, in vivo self-excited light source has been studied to eliminate the absorption and scattering of light by biological tissues. Additionally, new illumination schemes of light fractionation and metronomic PDTs have been proposed to ensure oxygen supply during PDT treatment. Oxygen carriers with high oxygen storage capacity or the chemical reaction substance can be delivered to the target lesion for in situ oxygen generation, which is the most popular method of enhancing oxygen supply for PDT. Additionally, hypoxia-activated linkers or prodrugs have been used to compensate for the low efficacy caused by hypoxia. However, reducing oxygen consumption during PDT can be achieved by limiting certain oxygen-consuming intracellular chemical reactions or reducing oxygen dependence using types I or IE PDT. To improve the therapeutic efficacy, PDT has been combined with clinical surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, photothermal therapy, sonodynamic therapy, magnetic hyperthermia, and immunotherapy. Three or more modes for synergistic treatment with PDT have been presented. Further, simultaneously employing two PSs targeting different subcellular organelle is also employed to improve PDT efficacy. Advanced optical imaging techniques such as hyperspectral imaging, Doppler optical coherence tomography, photoacoustic imaging measurement, and 102 luminescence imaging have been used successfully to monitor the dosimetric parameters from the original single-point/point-by-point signal acquisition to 2D imaging. The development of the detector has significantly improved the sensitivity, resolution, field of view, and speed of the optical imaging system. For example, the spatiotemporal detection of 102 luminescence can be accomplished by combining time-resolved scanning imaging and steady-state wide-field imaging. Clinical applications of PDT are primarily used for tumor-, vascular-, and microbial-targeting treatments. Vascular-targeting PDT has been successfully demonstrated for treating vascular-related diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and port-wine stain. Additionally, PDT is effective against bacteria, viruses, and fungi in clinical applications. Conclusions and Prospects Despite its clinical effectiveness, PDT is currently underutilized because of the non-fully satisfied and expensive PS, unclear dose-efficiency relationship, and difficulties in translating proof-of-principle research. To further improve PDT efficacy, ongoing research is being pursued to develop the multifunctional nano-PS, wearable LED and self-excited light sources, and the spatiotemporal multimodal optical imaging platform for monitoring and optimizing dosimetric parameters for pre-, during-, and post-PDT. © 2022 Science Press.

In contrast to radiological imaging techniques, molecular imaging techniques have the potential to assess plaque vulnerability by visualizing diseases-specific biomarkers. A risk factor for rupture is intra-plaque neovascularization, which is characterized by overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). Here, we study if administration of bevacizumab-800CW, a near-infrared tracer targeting VEGF-A, is safe and if molecular assessment of atherosclerotic carotid plaques in vivo is possible using multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT). Healthy volunteers and patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis scheduled for carotid artery endarterectomy were imaged with MSOT. Secondly, patients were imaged two days after intravenous administration of 4.5 bevacizumab-800CW. Ex vivo fluorescence molecular imaging of the surgically removed plaque specimen was performed and correlated with histopathology. In this first-in-human MSOT and fluorescence molecular imaging study, we show that administration of 4.5 mg bevacizumab-800CW appeared to be safe in five patients and accumulated in the carotid atherosclerotic plaque. Although we could visualize the carotid bifurcation area in all subjects using MSOT, bevacizumab-800CW-resolved signal could not be detected with MSOT in the patients.

While the therapeutic efficacy of plasma treatment has been observed in several types of diseases, the fundamental consequences of plasma-derived ROS on skin physiology remain unknown. We aimed to bridge this gap since the epidermal skin barrier and perfusion plays a vital role in health and disease by maintaining homeostasis and protecting from environmental damage. The intact skin of SKH1 mice was plasma-treated in vivo. Gene and protein expression was analyzed utilizing transcriptomics, qPCR, and Western blot. Immunofluorescence aided the analysis of percutaneous skin penetration of curcumin. Tissue oxygenation, perfusion, hemoglobin, and water index was investigated using hyperspectral imaging. Reversed-phase liquid-chromatography/mass spectrometry was performed for the identification of changes in the lipid composition and oxidation. Transcriptomic analysis of plasma-treated skin revealed modulation of genes involved in regulating the junctional network (tight, adherence, and gap junctions), which was confirmed using qPCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence imaging. Plasma treatment increased the disaggregation of cells in the stratum corneum (SC) concomitant with increased tissue oxygenation, gap junctional intercellular communication, and penetration of the model drug curcumin into the SC preceded by altered oxidation of skin lipids and their composition in vivo. In summary, plasma-derived ROS modify the junctional network, which promoted tissue oxygenation, oxidation of SC-lipids, and restricted penetration of the model drug curcumin, implicating that plasma may provide a novel and sensitive tool of skin barrier regulation. © 2020 The Author(s)","Elsevier Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Though adipogenesis mechanisms have been underscored in vitro, we lack information on how tissue and systemic factors influence the differentiation of new adipocytes. While this could be studied in zebrafish, adipocyte identification currently relies on neutral lipid labeling, thus precluding access to cells in early stages of differentiation. Here we report the generation and analysis of a zebrafish line with the transgene fabp4a(-2.7):EGFPcaax. In vivo confocal microscopy of the pancreatic and abdominal visceral depots of transgenic larvae, revealed the presence of labeled mature adipocytes as well as immature cells in earlier stages of differentiation. Through co-labeling for blood vessels, we observed a close interaction of differentiating adipocytes with endothelial cells through cell protrusions. Finally, we implemented hyperspectral imaging and spectral phasor analysis in Nile Red-labeled transgenic larvae and revealed the lipid metabolic transition towards neutral lipid accumulation of differentiating adipocytes. Altogether our work presents the characterization of a novel adipocyte-specific label in zebrafish and uncovers previously unknown aspects of in vivo adipogenesis. © 2021.

Inadvertent nerve injuries can have catastrophic consequences for the patient and lead to life-long pain and a reduced quality of life. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a non-invasive technique combining photography with spectroscopy, allowing non-invasive intraoperative biological tissue property quantification. We show, for the first time, that HSI combined with deep learning allows nerves and other tissue types to be automatically recognized in in vivo hyperspectral images. An animal model was used, and eight anesthetized pigs underwent neck midline incisions, exposing several structures (nerve, artery, vein, muscle, fat, skin). State-of-the-art machine learning models were trained to recognize these tissue types in HSI data. The best model was a convolutional neural network (CNN), achieving an overall average sensitivity of 0.91 and a specificity of 1.0, validated with leave-one-patient-out cross-validation. For the nerve, the CNN achieved an average sensitivity of 0.76 and a specificity of 0.99. In conclusion, HSI combined with a CNN model is suitable for in vivo nerve recognition. © 2021 by the authors.

The MBF spectral imaging technique demonstrates that stationary clustered GVs are efficiently localized and distinguished from unclustered GVs in agarose gel phantom and 3D vessel structures are visualized in ex vivo mouse liver specimens. Mouse macrophages serve as carriers of clustered and unclustered GVs and multiplexing beacons to report cells’ spatial locations by emitting distinct spectral signals. 2D MBF spectral images are reconstructed, and pixels in these images are classified depending on MBF values by comparing predetermined filters that predict the existence of cells with clustered and unclustered GVs.

Employing a method to extract additional spectral bands from RGB components (that we named cross-channels), we designed a handheld SFDI device to account for these pigments, using low-cost, consumer-grade components for its implementation and characterization. Aim: With only three broad spectral bands (red, green, blue, or RGB), consumer-grade devices are often too limited. We present a methodology to increase the number of spectral bands in SFDI devices that use RGB components without hardware modification. Approach: We developed a compact low-cost RGB spectral imager using a color CMOS camera and LED-based mini projector. The components' spectral properties were characterized and additional cross-channel bands were calculated. An alternative characterization procedure was also developed that makes use of low-cost equipment, and its results were compared. The device performance was evaluated by measurements on tissue-simulating optical phantoms and in-vivo tissue. The measurements were compared with another quantitative spectroscopy method: Spatial frequency domain spectroscopy (SFDS). Results: Out of six possible cross-channel bands, two were evaluated to be suitable for our application and were fully characterized (520 ± 20 nm; 556 ± 18 nm). The other four cross-channels presented a too low signal-to-noise ratio for this implementation. In estimating the optical properties of optical phantoms, the SFDI data have a strong linear correlation with the SFDS data (R2 = 0.987, RMSE = 0.006 for μa, R2 = 0.994, RMSE = 0.078 for μs′). Conclusions: We extracted two additional spectral bands from a commercial RGB system at no cost. There was good agreement between our device and the research-grade SFDS system. The alternative characterization procedure we have presented allowed us to measure the spectral features of the system with an accuracy comparable to standard laboratory equipment.  © 2020 The Authors.

Recent approaches in developing hyperspectral endoscopy are mainly focusing on enhancing image speed and quality of spectral information under a clinical environment, but there are many issues in obtaining consistent spectral information due to complicated imaging conditions, including imaging angle, non-uniform illumination, working distance, and low reflected signal. We quantitatively investigated the effect of imaging angle on the distortion of spectral information by exploiting a bifurcated fiber, spectrometer, and tissue-mimicking phantom. Spectral distortion becomes severe as increasing the angle of the imaging fiber or shortening camera exposure time for fast image acquisition. Moreover, spectral ranges from 450 to 550 nm are more susceptible to the angle-dependent spectral distortion than longer spectral ranges. Therefore, imaging angles close to normal and longer target spectral ranges with enough detector exposure time could minimize spectral distortion in hyperspectral endoscopy. These findings will help implement clinical HSI endoscopy for the robust and accurate measurement of spectral information from patients in vivo. © 2022, The Author(s).","Nature Research","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Water-soluble Nd-GQDs/Tm-GQDs with average diameters of 5.6–8.2 nm possess crystalline graphene lattice with <1 atomic percent of Nd/Tm and exhibit NIR fluorescence at ≈1060/≈925 nm attributed to the intrinsic transitions of Nd3+/Tm3+. High biocompatibility with >80% cell viability at 1 mg mL−1 for Nd-GQDs and 0.25 mg mL−1 for Tm-GQDs makes them well-suited for bioimaging. In vitro, both GQD types exhibit efficient internalization with their intracellular emission maximized at 6 h. The pH-dependence of this emission can serve as plethora of diagnostic applications. GQDs enable in vivo NIR imaging in live sedated NCr nude mice with IV administration: their NIR emission maximized at 6 h post-injection is primarily detected in intestine, kidneys, liver, and spleen, however, diminishing to none at 48 h. Ex vivo organ/slice imaging shows significant Tm-GQD fluorescence signatures in the aforementioned organs/slices.

Nanoparticle (NP)-based technologies have been utilized for targeted drug delivery during chemotherapies, photodynamic therapy, and immunotherapy. Another active area of research is the toxicity studies of these nanomaterials to understand the cellular uptake and transport of these materials in cells, tissues, and environment. Traditional techniques such as transmission electron microscopy, and mass spectrometry to analyze NP-based cellular transport or toxicity effect are expensive, require extensive sample preparation, and are low-throughput. Dark-field hyperspectral imaging (DF-HSI), an integration of spectroscopy and microscopy/imaging, provides the ability to investigate cellular transport of these NPs and to quantify the distribution of them within bio-materials. DF-HSI also offers versatility in non-invasively monitoring microorganisms, single cell, and proteins. DF-HSI is a low-cost, label-free technique that is minimally invasive and is a viable choice for obtaining high-throughput quantitative molecular analyses. Multimodal imaging modalities such as Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy are also being integrated with HSI systems to enable chemical imaging of the samples. HSI technology is being applied in surgeries to obtain molecular information about the tissues in real-time. This article provides brief overview of fundamental principles of DF-HSI and its application for nanomaterials, protein-detection, single-cell analysis, microbiology, surgical procedures along with technical challenges and future integrative approach with other imaging and measurement modalities.

While most of the preclinical imaging has provided a number of multiplexing channels up to three, Raman imaging with surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoparticles was suggested to offer higher multiplexing capability originating from their narrow spectral width. However, in vivo multiplexed SERS imaging is still in its infancy for multichannel visualization of tumors, which require both sufficient multiplicity and high sensitivity concurrently. Here we create multispectral palettes of gold multicore-near-infrared (NIR) resonant Raman dyes-silica shell SERS (NIR-SERRS) nanoparticle oligomers and demonstrate noninvasive and five-plex SERS imaging of the nanoparticle accumulation in tumors of living mice. We perform the five-plex ratiometric imaging of tumors by varying the administered ratio of the nanoparticles, which simulates the detection of multiple biomarkers with different expression levels in the tumor environment. Furthermore, since this method does not require the excision of tumor tissues at the imaging condition, we perform noninvasive and longitudinal imaging of the five-color nanoparticles in the tumors, which is not feasible with current ex vivo multiplexed tissue analysis platforms. Our work surpasses the multiplicity limit of previous preclinical tumor imaging methods while keeping enough sensitivity for tumor-targeted in vivo imaging and could enable the noninvasive assessment of multiple biological targets within the tumor microenvironment in living subjects.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.","American Chemical Society","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Photoacoustic (PA) imaging is an emerging non-invasive biomedical imaging modality that has potential for intraoperative micrographic control of surgical margins. This is the first study to assess the feasibility of PA imaging for the detection of periocular skin cancer. Eleven patients underwent surgical excision of periocular skin cancer, one of which was a malignant melanoma (MM), eight were basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), and two squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Six tumors were located in the eyelid, and five in periocular skin. The excised samples, as well as healthy eyelid samples, were scanned with PA imaging postoperatively, using 59 wavelengths in the range 680–970 nm, to generate 3D multispectral images. Spectral unmixing was performed using endmember spectra for oxygenated and deoxygenated Hb, melanin, and collagen, to identify the chromophore composition of tumors and healthy eyelid tissue. After PA scanning, the tumor samples were examined histopathologically using standard hematoxylin and eosin staining. The PA spectra of healthy eyelid tissue were dominated by melanin in the skin, oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin in the orbicularis oculi muscle, and collagen in the tarsal plate. Multiwavelength 3D scanning provided spectral information on the three tumor types. The spectrum from the MM was primarily reconstructed by the endmember melanin, while the SCCs showed contributions primarily from melanin, but also HbR and collagen. BCCs showed contributions from all four endmembers with a predominance of HbO2 and HbR. PA imaging may be used to distinguish different kinds of periocular skin tumors, paving the way for future intraoperative micrographic control. © 2021 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement.","The Optical Society","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The added spectral dimension enables the visualization of underlying biochemical information in tissues. Unfortunately, existing acquisition systems which use multispectral filter wheels or variable light source for spectral data collection, face the challenge of co-registration and are hard to be realized in real-time as acquisition time per frame is high. A Multispectral SnapShot Camera (MSSC) is demonstrated to address these obstacles, which is capable of capturing data simultaneously in multiple wavelengths with a single click. This brings down the total acquisition time to a few milliseconds per data cube (spatial+spectral) which encourages translation of this technology for real-time diagnosis. The MSSC is composed of 16 spectral bands with peak wavelengths in the visible range 460 nm - 600 nm. The application of MSSC in the field of oral cancer diagnosis has been demonstrated with in-vivo tissue images captured from 10 patients with oral dysplasia. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) was used to differentiate between healthy and malignant tissue. PCA was used to compress the multispectral datacube to extract wavelengths with maximum variance and SAM discriminates between tissue conditions based on distinct spectral profiles. The mean absorption spectrum plotted for them shows a trend of higher absorption peak value in malignant tissue regions than in healthy regions, thereby demonstrating the capability of MSSC for tumor tissue classification.  © 2022 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Similarly,1.25 μl of ICG diluted at a ratio of one-fourth with physiological saline solution was injected into the right anterior camera of all rats. The thickness of the skin in the mandibular area, connective tissue, and the depth of the mandibular lymph node (MLN) made image retrieval difficult. For QD, 302 nm UV excitation and 605 nm fluorescence peak emission were applied. The detection of QD and ICG used in this study in the MLNs is definitive evidence that aqueous humor (AH) follows a uveolymphatic pathway.

Precise control of the LA effect is required to safely destroy the tumor. Although temperature imaging techniques provide an indirect measurement of the thermal damage, a degree of uncer-tainty remains about the treatment effect. Optical techniques are currently emerging as tools to di-rectly assess tissue thermal damage. Among them, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has shown promising results in image-guided surgery and in the thermal ablation field. The highly informative data provided by HSI, associated with deep learning, enable the implementation of non-invasive prediction models to be used intraoperatively. Here we show a novel paradigm “peak temperature prediction model” (PTPM), convolutional neural network (CNN)-based, trained with HSI and infrared imaging to predict LA-induced damage in the liver. The PTPM demonstrated an optimal agreement with tissue damage classification providing a consistent threshold (50.6 ± 1.5 °C) for the damage margins with high accuracy (~0.90). The high correlation with the histology score (r = 0.9085) and the comparison with the measured peak temperature confirmed that PTPM preserves temperature information accordingly with the histopathological assessment. © 2021 by the authors.

COPD progresses with aging, and chronic smoking is the key susceptibility factor in lung pathological changes concurrent with mitochondrial dysfunction and biological aging. However, these processes involving cigarette smoke (CS)-mediated lung cellular senescence are difficult to distinguish. One of the impediments to studying cellular senescence in relation to age-related lung pathologies is the lack of a suitable in vivo model. In view of this, we provide evidence that supports the suitability of p16-3MR mice to studying cellular senescence in CS-mediated and age-related lung pathologies. p16-3MR mice have a trimodal reporter fused to the promoter of the p16INK4a gene that enables detection, isolation, and selective elimination of senescent cells, thus making them a suitable model to study cellular senescence. To determine their suitability in CS-mediated lung pathologies, we exposed young (12–14 months) and old (17–20 months) p16-3MR mice to 30 day CS exposure and studied the expression of senescent genes (p16, p21, and p53) and SASP-associated markers (MMP9, MMP12, PAI-1, and FN-1) in air-and CS-exposed mouse lungs. Our results showed that this model could detect cellular senescence using luminescence and isolate cells undergoing senescence with the help of tissue fluorescence in CS-exposed young and old mice. Our results from the expression of senescence markers and SASP-associated genes in CS-exposed young and old p16-3MR mice were comparable with increased lung cellular senescence and SASP in COPD. We further showed alteration in the; (i) tissue luminescence and fluorescence, (ii) mRNA and protein expressions of senescent markers and SASP genes, and (iii) SA-β-gal activity in CS-exposed young and old p16-3MR mice as compared to their air controls. Overall, we showed that p16-3MR is a competent model for studying the cellular senescence in CS-induced pathologies. Hence, the p16-3MR reporter mouse model may be used as a novel tool for understanding the pathobiology of cellular senescence and other underlying mechanisms involved in COPD and fibrosis. © 2021 by the authors.

We assess the feasibility of using multispectral imaging and deep learning to enhance surgical vision by automated identification of normal human head and neck tissues. Study Design: Construction and feasibility testing of novel multispectral imaging system for surgery. Setting: Academic university hospital. Subjects and Methods: Multispectral images of fresh-preserved human cadaveric tissues were captured with our adapted digital operating microscope. Eleven tissue types were sampled, each sequentially exposed to 6 lighting conditions. Two convolutional neural network machine learning models were developed to classify tissues based on multispectral and white-light color images (ARRInet-M and ARRInet-W, respectively). Blinded otolaryngology residents were asked to identify tissue specimens from white-light color images, and their performance was compared with that of the ARRInet models. Results: A novel multispectral imaging system was developed with minimal adaptation to an existing digital operating microscope. With 81.8% accuracy in tissue identification of full-size images, the multispectral ARRInet-M classifier outperformed the white-light-only ARRInet-W model (45.5%) and surgical residents (69.7%). Challenges with discrimination occurred with parotid vs fat and blood vessels vs nerve. Conclusions: A deep learning model using multispectral imaging outperformed a similar model and surgical residents using traditional white-light imaging at the task of classifying normal human head and neck tissue ex vivo. These results suggest that multispectral imaging can enhance surgical vision and augment surgeons’ ability to identify tissues during a procedure. © American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2020.","SAGE Publications Inc.","Article","","Scopus"

Hyperspectral imaging is a non-invasive imaging technique that measures the reflectance spectra of skin in vivo. The aim of this prospective pilot study was to use a convolutional neural network classifier in hyperspectral images for differential diagnosis between pigmented basal cell carcinomas and melanoma. A total of 26 pigmented lesions (10 pigmented basal cell carcinomas, 12 melanomas in situ, 4 invasive melanomas) were imaged with hyperspectral imaging and excised for histopathological diagnosis. For 2-class classifier (melanocytic tumours vs pigmented basal cell carcinomas) using the majority of the pixels to predict the class of the whole lesion, the results showed a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval 81-100%), specificity of 90% (95% confidence interval 60-98%) and positive predictive value of 94% (95% confidence interval 73-99%). These results indicate that a convolutional neural network classifier can differentiate melanocytic tumours from pigmented basal cell carcinomas in hyperspectral images. Further studies are warranted in order to confirm these preliminary results, using larger samples and multiple tumour types, including all types of melanocytic lesions. © 2021, Medical Journals/Acta D-V.

Our previous studies revealed that breast cancer-derived MDSCs could induce a group of PD-1−PD-L1+ Bregs with immunosuppressive functions. Here, we reported that blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interaction between MDSCs and B cells could reverse the immunosuppressive functions of PD-1−PD-L1+ Bregs. The activation of PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway is essential for PD-1−PD-L1+ Bregs to exert immunosuppressive effects. MDSCs activated the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway in B cells via the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Furthermore, inhibition of PD-1/PD-L1 or PI3K/AKT signaling suppressed both tumor growth and the immunosuppressive functions of PD-1−PD-L1+ Bregs. Dual suppression of PD-1/PD-L1 and PI3K/AKT exerted better antitumor effect. Finally, MDSCs and PD-1−PD-L1+ Bregs were colocalized in breast cancer tissues and PD-1−PD-L1+ Bregs were positively correlated with poor prognosis. Thus, MDSC-educated PD-1−PD-L1+ Bregs and their regulatory mechanisms could contribute to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Our study proposes a novel mechanism for MDSC-mediated regulation of B cell immunity, which might shed new light on tumor immunotherapy.+ © 2021, The Author(s).","Springer Nature","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In this study, we employed eigenspectra multispectral optoacoustic tomography (eMSOT) as a nextgeneration optoacousticmethod to impart high accuracy in resolving tumor hemodynamics during bevacizumab therapy in two types of breast cancer xenografts (KPL-4 and MDA-MB-468). Patterns of tumor total hemoglobin concentration (THb) and oxygen saturation (sO2) were imaged in control and bevacizumab-treated tumors over the course of 58 days (KPL-4) and 16 days (MDA-MB-468), and the evolution of functional vasculature ""normalization""was resolved macroscopically. Aninitial sharp drop in tumor sO2 andTHb content shortly after the initiation of bevacizumab treatment was followed by a recovery in oxygenation levels. Rim-core subregion analysis revealed steep spatial oxygenation gradients in growing tumors that were reduced after bevacizumab treatment. Critically, eMSOT imaging findings were validated directly by histopathologic assessment of hypoxia (pimonidazole) and vascularity (CD31).

However, it is limited in providing structural information compared to other imaging modalities, such as ultrasound imaging. Thus, to offer complete morphological details of biological tissues, photoacoustic imaging is typically integrated with ultrasound imaging. This dual-modal imaging technique is already implemented on commercial clinical ultrasound imaging platforms. However, commercial platforms suffer from limited elevation resolution compared to the lateral and axial resolution. We have successfully developed a dual-modal photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging to address these limitations, specifically targeting animal studies. The system can acquire whole-body images of mice in vivo and provide complementary structural and functional information of biological tissue information simultaneously. The color-coded depth information can be readily obtained in photoacoustic images using complementary information from ultrasound images. The system can be used for several biomedical applications, including drug delivery, biodistribution assessment, and agent testing. © 2021 by the authors.

We developed novel assays based on 3D, microscopic, cryo-imaging of whole-mouse-sized volumes to assess the therapeutic potential of human MSCs using an established mouse GVHD model. Following infusion, we quantitatively tracked fluorescently labeled, donor-derived, T-cells and third party MSCs in BMT recipients using multispectral cryo-imaging. Specific MSC homing sites were identified in the marginal zones in the spleen and the lymph nodes, where we believe MSC immunomodulation takes place. The number of MSCs found in spleen of the allo BMT recipients was about 200% more than that observed in the syngeneic group. To more carefully define the effects MSCs had on T cell activation and expansion, we developed novel T-cell proliferation assays including secondary lymphoid organ (SLO) enlargement and Carboxyfluoescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) dilution. As anticipated, significant SLO volume enlargement and CFSE dilution was observed in allo but not syn BMT recipients due to rapid proliferation and expansion of labeled T-cells. MSC treatment markedly attenuated CFSE dilution and volume enlargement of SLO. These assays confirm evidence of potent, in vivo, immunomodulatory properties of MSC following allo BMT. Our innovative platform includes novel methods for tracking cells of interest as well as assessing therapeutic function of MSCs during GVHD induction. Our results support the use of MSCs treatment or prevention of GVHD and illuminate the wider adoption of MSCs as a standard medicinal cell therapy. © 2023, The Author(s).","Nature Research","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Background: Despite advances in cardiovascular diagnostics, the analytic tools and imaging technologies currently available have limited capabilities for evaluating in situ biochemical changes associated with luminal surface features. Earlier studies of small number of samples have shown differences among the autofluorescence lifetime signature of well-defined lesions, but a systematic pixel-level evaluation of fluorescence signatures associated with various histological features is lacking and needed to better understand the origins of fluorescence contrast. Methods: Human coronary artery segments (n = 32) were analyzed with a bimodal catheter system combining multispectral FLIm with intravascular ultrasonography compatible with in vivo coronary imaging. Various histological components present along the luminal surface (200-μm depth) were systematically tabulated (12 sectors) from each serial histological section (n = 204). Morphological information provided by ultrasonography allowed for the accurate registration of imaging data with histology data. The relationships between histological findings and FLIm parameters obtained from 3 spectral channels at each measurement location (n = 33,980) were characterized. Results: Our findings indicate that fluorescence lifetime from different spectral bands can be used to quantitatively predict the superficial presence of macrophage foam cells (mFCs) (area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve: 0.94) and extracellular lipid content in advanced lesions (lifetime increase in 540-nm band), detect superficial calcium (lifetime decrease in 450-nm band area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve: 0.90), and possibly detect lesions consistent with active plaque formation such as pathological intimal thickening and healed thrombus regions (lifetime increase in 390-nm band). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that autofluorescence lifetime provides valuable information for characterizing atherosclerotic lesions in coronary arteries. Specifically, FLIm can be used to identify key phenomena linked with plaque progression (e.g., peroxidized-lipid–rich mFC accumulation and recent plaque formation). © 2021 The Authors","Elsevier Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Rapid and non-destructive detection and identification of nanosized materials in cells, tissues and organisms is still challenging, although a number of conventional methods exist. These approaches for nanoparticles imaging and characterisation both inside the cytoplasm and on the cell or tissue outer surfaces, such as electron or scanning probe microscopies, are unquestionably potent tools, having excellent resolution and supplemented with chemical analysis capabilities. However, imaging and detection of nanomaterials in situ, in wet unfixed and even live samples, such as living isolated cells, microorganisms, protozoans and miniature invertebrates using electron microscopy is practically impossible, because of the elaborate sample preparation requiring chemical fixation, contrast staining, matrix embedding and exposure into vacuum. Atomic force microscopy, in several cases, can be used for imaging and mechanical analysis of live cells and organisms under ambient conditions, however this technique allows for investigation of surfaces. Therefore, a different approach allowing for imaging and differentiation of nanoscale particles in wet samples is required. Dark-field microscopy as an optical microscopy technique has been popular among researchers, mostly for imaging relatively large specimens. In recent years, the so-called “enhanced dark field” microscopy based on using higher numerical aperture light condensers and variable numerical aperture objectives has emegred, which allows for imaging of nanoscale particles (starting from 5 nm nanospheres) using almost conventional optical microscopy methodology. Hyperspectral imaging can turn a dark-field optical microscope into a powerful chemical characterisation tool. As a result, this technique is becoming popular in environmental nanotoxicology studies. In this Review Article we introduce the reader into the methodology of enhanced dark-field and dark-field-based hyperspectral microscopy, covering the most important advances in this rapidly-expanding area of environmental nanotoxicology. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Elsevier B.V.","Review","","Scopus"

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in comparison to micro-Doppler sonography (MDS) to monitor MFF perfusion in an in vivo rodent model. Bilateral groin flaps were raised on 20 Sprague–Dawley rats. The femoral artery was transected on the trial side and re-anastomosed. Flaps and anastomoses were assessed before, during, and after the period of ischemia every ten minutes for overall 60 min using HSI and MDS. The contralateral sides’ flaps served as controls. Tissue-oxygenation saturation (StO2), near-infrared perfusion index (NPI), hemoglobin (THI), and water distribution (TWI) were assessed by HSI, while blood flow was assessed by MDS. HSI correlates with the MDS signal in the case of sufficient and completely interrupted perfusion. HSI was able to validly and reproducibly detect tissue perfusion status using StO2 and NPI. After 40 min, flap perfusion decreased due to the general aggravation of hemodynamic circulatory situation, which resulted in a significant drop of StO2 (p < 0.005) and NPI (p < 0.005), whereas the Doppler signal remained unchanged. In accordance, HSI might be suitable to detect MFF general complications in an early stage and further decrease MFF failure rates, whereas MDS may only be used for direct complications at the anastomose site. © 2022 by the authors.","MDPI","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, despite great progresses in recent years, precision medicine for cancer treatment is not always part of routine care. Indeed, the ability to specifically tailor therapies to distinct patient profiles requires still significant improvements in targeted therapy development as well as decreases in drug treatment failures. In this regard, preclinical animal research is fundamental to advance our understanding of tumor biology, and diagnostic and therapeutic response. Most importantly, the ability to measure drug–target engagement accurately in live and intact animals is critical in guiding the development and optimization of targeted therapy. However, a major limitation of preclinical molecular imaging modalities is their lack of capability to directly and quantitatively discriminate between drug accumulation and drug–target engagement at the pathological site. Recently, we have developed Macroscopic Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (MFLI) as a unique feature of optical imaging to quantitate in vivo drug–target engagement. MFLI quantitatively reports on nanoscale interactions via lifetime-sensing of Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) in live, intact animals. Hence, MFLI FRET acts as a direct reporter of receptor dimerization and target engagement via the measurement of the fraction of labeled-donor entity undergoing binding to its respective receptor. MFLI is expected to greatly impact preclinical imaging and also adjacent fields such as image-guided surgery and drug development. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Humana Press Inc.","Book chapter","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Antibody-based immunotherapy showed limited success for pancreatic cancer, partly owing to the low delivery rate of the drug into the tumor. Herein, we describe a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid;PLGA)-based siRNA nanoparticle targeting PD-L1 (siPD-L1@PLGA). The siPD-L1@PLGA exhibited efficient knockdown of PD-L1 in cancer cells, without affecting the cell viability up to 6 mg/mL. Further, 99.2% of PDAC cells uptake the nanoparticle and successfully blocked the IFN-gamma-mediated PD-L1 induction. Consistently, the siPD-L1@PLGA sensitized cancer cells to antigen-specific immune cells, as exemplified by Ovalbumin-targeting T cells. To evaluate its efficacy in vivo, we adopted a pancreatic PDX model in humanized mice, generated by grafting CD34+ hematopoeitic stem cells onto NSG mice. The siPD-L1@PLGA significantly suppressed pancreatic tumor growth in this model with upregulated IFN-gamma positive CD8 T cells, leading to more apoptotic tumor cells. Multiplex immunofluorescence analysis exhibited comparable immune cell compositions in control and siPD-L1@PLGA-treated tumors. However, we found higher Granzyme B expression in the siPD-L1@PLGA-treated tumors, suggesting higher activity of NK or cytotoxic T cells.

Hyperspectral imaging represents a suitable, non-invasive method to evaluate tissue morphology and organ perfusion during NMP. Liver allografts were subjected to NMP prior to LT. Serial image acquisition of oxygen saturation levels (StO2), organ hemoglobin (THI), near-infrared perfusion (NIR) and tissue water indices (TWI) through hyperspectral imaging was performed during static cold storage, at 1h, 6h, 12h and at the end of NMP. The readouts were correlated with perfusate parameters at equivalent time points. Twenty-one deceased donor livers were included in the study. Seven (33.0%) were discarded due to poor organ function during NMP. StO2 (p < 0.001), THI (p < 0.001) and NIR (p = 0.002) significantly augmented, from static cold storage (pre-NMP) to NMP end, while TWI dropped (p = 0.005) during the observational period. At 12–24h, a significantly higher hemoglobin concentration (THI) in the superficial tissue layers was seen in discarded, compared to transplanted livers (p = 0.036). Lactate values at 12h NMP correlated negatively with NIR perfusion index between 12 and 24h NMP and with the delta NIR perfusion index between 1 and 24h (rs = −0.883, p = 0.008 for both). Furthermore, NIR and TWI correlated with lactate clearance and pH. This study provides first evidence of feasibility of hyperspectral imaging as a potentially helpful contact-free organ viability assessment tool during liver NMP.

Hyperspectral imaging is a trending topic in remote sensing field. It is used to collect the spectral information present in the scene. Additionally, the combination of spectral and spatial data offers valuable data for classifying brain tumours. When combined with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, HSI (Hyperspectral Imaging) can be utilised as a non-intrusive medical diagnosis tool. By using hyperspectral images in medical field, we can classify the cancers, tissues, blood vessels etc. In this paper, we have proposed a gradient boosting based ensembled classification (MCGC) method for In-Vivo brain cancer classification.

However, current methods for estimating sO2 yield inaccurate results in realistic settings, due to the unknown and wavelength-dependent influence of the light fluence on the signal. In this work, we propose learned spectral decoloring to enable blood oxygenation measurements to be inferred from multispectral photoacoustic imaging. The method computes sO2 pixel-wise, directly from initial pressure spectra Sp0(λ,x), which represent initial pressure values at a fixed spatial location x over all recorded wavelengths λ. The method is compared to linear unmixing approaches, as well as pO2 and blood gas analysis reference measurements.

There have been several clinical trials for screening cancer patients by analyzing multispectral responses, which in turn provide metabolomic information about the underlying biological tissues. This review summarizes the methods and results of clinical photoacoustic trials available in the literature to date to classify cancerous tissues, specifically of the thyroid and breast.

However, such fluorophores are rare and, due to accumulation-derived toxicity, are often restricted from clinical applications. Deep tissue imaging not only provided by near-infrared fluorophores but also conventionally carried out by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) is also hampered by the toxicity of the contrast agents. This work offers a biocompatible imaging solution: cerium oxide (CeO2) nanocubes doped with ytterbium or neodymium, and co-doped with gadolinium, showing simultaneous potential for near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applications. A synthetic process described in this work allows for the stable incorporation of ytterbium or neodymium, both possessing emissive transitions in the NIR. As a biocompatible nanomaterial, the CeO2 nanocubes act as an ideal host material for doping, minimizing lanthanide fluorescence self-quenching as well as any potential toxicity associated with the dopants. The uptake of nanocubes by HeLa cells maximized at 12 h was monitored by hyperspectral imaging of the ytterbium or neodymium NIR emission, indicating the capacity of the lanthanide-doped nanocubes for in vitro and a potential for in vivo fluorescence imaging. The co-doped nanocubes demonstrate no significant loss of NIR emission intensity upon co-doping with 2 atomic % gadolinium and exhibit magnetic susceptibilities in the range of known negative contrast agents. However, a small increase to 6 atomic % gadolinium significantly affects the magnetic susceptibility ratio (r2/r1), shifting closer to the positive contrast range and suggesting the potential use of the CeO2 nanocube matrix doped with selected rare-earth ions as a tunable MRI contrast agent with NIR imaging capabilities. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","American Chemical Society","Article","","Scopus"

Most chemotherapeutic agents exert their antitumoral effects by rapid induction of apoptosis. Another main feature of breast cancer is hypoxia, which may drive malignant progression and confer resistance to various forms of therapy. Thus, multi-aspect imaging of both tumor apoptosis and oxygenation in vivo would be of enormous value for the effective evaluation of therapy response. Herein, we demonstrate the capability of a hybrid imaging modality known as multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) to provide high-resolution, simultaneous imaging of tumor apoptosis and oxygenation, based on both the exogenous contrast of an apoptosis-targeting dye and the endogenous contrast of hemoglobin. MSOT imaging was applied on mice bearing orthotopic 4T1 breast tumors before and following treatment with doxorubicin. Apoptosis was monitored over time by imaging the distribution of xPLORE-APOFL750©, a highly sensitive poly-caspase binding apoptotic probe, within the tumors. Oxygenation was monitored by tracking the distribution of oxy-and deoxygenated hemoglobin within the same tumor areas. Doxorubicin treatment induced an increase in apoptosis-depending optoacoustic signal of xPLORE-APOFL750© at 24 h after treatment. Furthermore, our results showed spatial correspondence between xPLORE-APO750© and deoxygenated hemoglobin. In vivo apoptotic status of the tumor tissue was independently verified by ex vivo fluorescence analysis. Overall, our results provide a rationale for the use of MSOT as an effective tool for simultaneously investigating various aspects of tumor pathophysiology and potential effects of therapeutic regimes based on both endogenous and exogenous molecular contrasts. © 2021 by the authors.

Diagnosis made in the early stage of disease may imporve outcomes. The discovery of malignant growth utilizing noninvasive light intrusive methods in lieu of conventional excisional biopsy may assist in achieving this goal. Materials and methods: The change of the optical properties of ex-vivo breast tissues provides different responses to light transmission, absorption, and particularly the reflection over the spectrum range. We offer the use of Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) with advanced image processing and pattern recognition in order to analyze HSI data for breast cancer detection. The spectral signatures were mined and evaluated in both malignant and normal tissue. K-mean clustering was designed for classifying hyperspectral data in order to evaluate and detection of cancer tissue. This method was used to detect ex-vivo breast cancer. Spatial spectral images were created to high spot the differences in the reflectance properties of malignant versus normal tissue. Results: Trials showed that the superficial spectral reflection images within 500 nm wavelength showed high variance (214.65) between cancerous and normal breast tissues. On the other hand, image within 620 nm wavelength showed low variance (0.0020).However, the superimposed of spectral region 420–620 nm was proposed as the optimum bandwidth. Finally, the proposed HS imaging system was capable to discriminate the tumor region from normal tissue of the ex-vivo breast sample with sensitivity and a specificity of 95 % and 96 %. Conclusions: High sensitivity and specificity were achieved, which proposes potential for HSI as an edge evaluation method to enhance the surgical outcome compared to the presently available techniques in the clinics. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Elsevier B.V.","Article","","Scopus"

This study reports on a comprehensive evaluation of core-shell electrospun fibers loaded with silver nanoparticles (Ag NP) where the delivery rate was controlled by different sizes of Ag NP and thermoresponsive poly(n-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) hydrogel particles. Fiber meshes also contain zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NP), to improve pore structure for controlled release of Ag NP. In vitro cytotoxicity studies using cultured human A549 epithelial cells demonstrated that the ZnO NP component, which is known to cause cytotoxicity, of the fiber meshes did cause measurable cell death. In vitro antibacterial efficacy of the fiber meshes was shown with rapid and efficient growth inhibition in E. coli bacterial culture. Fiber meshes were implanted subcutaneously for up to 27 days in male and female C57BL/6 mice to evaluate the in vivo drug release and biocompatibility. Hyperspectral microscopy was used as an advanced tool to determine precise location of released Ag NP into the skin compared to the conventional tissue staining methods. Results suggested that Ag NP were continuously released over 27 days of implantation in mice. Hyperspectral imaging revealed that released Ag NP dispersed in the dermis of male mice, however, Ag NP accumulated in the hair follicles of female mice (Figure). Mice implanted with fiber meshes containing ZnO NP had better hair regrowth and wound healing, which was in contrast to in vitro cytotoxicity results. These findings suggest that these newly developed fiber meshes can have unique long-term release of drugs loaded in the fiber core and appear to be biocompatible. The differences in the sex-bias outcome suggest the opportunity for development of sex-specific drug delivery systems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Elsevier Ltd","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Bacteria can be engineered to overcome a major challenge of existing therapeutics by differentiating between malignant and healthy tissue. A prerequisite for further development and study of engineered bacteria is a suitable imaging concept which allows bacterial visualization in tissue and monitoring bacterial targeting and proliferation. Optoacoustics (OA) is an evolving technology allowing whole-tumor imaging and thereby direct observation of bacterial colonization in tumor regions. However, bacterial detection using OA is currently hampered by the lack of endogenous contrast or suitable transgene fluorescent labels. Here, we demonstrate improved visualization of cancer-targeting bacteria using OA imaging and E. coli engineered to express tyrosinase, which uses L-tyrosine as the substrate to produce the strong optoacoustic probe melanin in the tumor microenvironment. Tumors of animals injected with tyrosinase-expressing E. coli showed strong melanin signals, allowing to resolve bacterial growth in the tumor over time using multispectral OA tomography (MSOT).

In recent years, there has been tremendous developments in this field and photoacoustic imaging is now facing an exciting challenge of clinical translation. We developed a multispectral LED-based photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging system (AcousticX), which has been already proven to be useful in multiple preclinical and clinical superficial imaging applications. In the first version of AcousticX, acoustic detection was performed using linear array ultrasound probes with center frequencies of 5, 7 and 10 MHz. With these probes, we were able to achieve an imaging depth of 1 cm in tissue in vivo with spatial resolution of around 150-250 μm. However, it is important to improve the imaging depth for exploring wide range of deep-tissue applications. In this work, we developed a new broadband 2.5 MHz ultrasound probe to improve the imaging depth. Using this ultrasound probe and 850 nm LED arrays, we performed phantom, ex vivo and in vivo human volunteer studies and achieved an imaging depth of 2.5-3 cm. We compared the imaging performance of the newly developed probe with the already available US probes and conformed that the 2.5 MHz probe is 3-4 times more sensitive with spatial resolution suitable for deep-tissue applications. When imaging the brachial artery of a human volunteer, we achieved an imaging depth of 2.6 cm at a frame rate of 6 Hz, which is the highest reported in vivo imaging depth in LED-based photoacoustic imaging. We believe that this is the first step towards real-time deep tissue LED-based photoacoustic imaging with potential in multiple clinical applications. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

During surgery, surgeons often need intraoperative frozen analysis and pathologic consultation in order to detect PTC. In some cases pathologists cannot determine if the tumor is aggressive until the operation has been completed. In this work, we have taken tumor classification a step further by determining the tumor aggressiveness of fresh surgical specimens. We employed hyperspectral imaging (HSI) in combination with multiparametric radiomic features to complete this task. The study cohort includes 72 ex-vivo tissue specimens from 44 patients with pathology-confirmed PTC. A total of 67 features were extracted from this data. Using machine learning classification methods, we were able to achieve an AUC of 0.85.

Yet today there are no percutaneous devices that can detect autofluorescence signals from inside a beating heart. Our aim was to develop a prototype catheter to demonstrate the feasibility of doing so. Methods and Results: Here we summarize technical solutions leading to the development of a percutaneous catheter capable of multispectral imaging of intracardiac surfaces. The process included several iterations of light sources, optical filtering, and image acquisition techniques. The developed system included a compliant balloon, 355 nm laser irradiance, a high-sensitivity CCD, bandpass filtering, and image acquisition synchronized with the cardiac cycle. It enabled us to capture autofluorescence images from multiple spectral bands within the visible range while illuminating the endocardial surface with ultraviolet light. Principal component analysis and other spectral unmixing post-processing algorithms were then used to reveal target tissue. Conclusion: Based on the success of our prototype system, we are confident that the development of ever more sensitive cameras, recent advances in tunable filters, fiber bundles, and other optical and computational components makes it possible to create percutaneous catheters capable of acquiring hyper or multispectral hypercubes, including those based on autofluorescence, in real-time. This opens the door for widespread use of this methodology for high-resolution intraoperative imaging of internal tissues and organs—including cardiovascular applications. © 2020, Biomedical Engineering Society.","Springer","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The application of a titanium coating could also be beneficial to address concerns regarding the exposure of PP in an in vivo environment. Many studies have shown that PP, although it is widely accepted as a stable polymer, is subject to oxidation and degradation, such degradation affects the mechanical behavior, that is, the stiffness and tensile strength of PP mesh. Despite the wide clinical use of Ti-PP surgical meshes, no study has yet investigated the residual material properties post clinical deployment and subsequent explantation. In this study, two explanted Ti-PP mesh samples each having different incorporation durations from two patients were examined. Material analysis conducted within this study includes the following techniques: attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, low voltage – scanning electron microscopy (LV-SEM), backscattered electron (BSE) imaging, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and secondary election hyperspectral imaging (SEHI). The hypothesis of this study is that the Ti coating successfully shields the PP mesh from oxidative stress in vivo and thus protects it from degradation. The results of this analysis show for the first time evidence of bulk oxidation, surface degradation, and environmental stress cracking on explanted Ti-PP meshes. © 2023 The Authors.

We report the development of an instrument employing Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) arrays to realize real-time multispectral autofluorescence lifetime imaging at a macroscopic scale using handheld single-point fibre optic probes, under bright background conditions. At the detection end, the fluorescence signal is passed through a transmission grating and both spectral and temporal information are encoded in the SPAD array. This configuration allows interrogation in the spectral range of interest in real time. Spatial information is provided by an external camera together with a guiding beam that provides a visual reference that is tracked in real-time. Through fast image processing and data analysis, fluorescence lifetime maps are augmented on white light images to provide feedback of the measurements in real-time. We validate and demonstrate the practicality of this technique in the reference fluorophores and in articular cartilage samples mimicking the degradation that occurs in osteoarthritis. Our results demonstrate that SPADs together with fibre probes can offer means to report autofluorescence spectral and lifetime contrast in real-time and thus are suitable candidates for in situ tissue diagnostics. © 2020, The Author(s).","Nature Research","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, due to the changes of spectral signatures of some exogenous contrast agents in vitro and in vivo, the conventional fitting method will be hindered. Although the blind unmixing algorithms do not require the exact absorption spectrum of each chromophore in advance, it is often sensitive to noise, which may lead to low quantitative results. Considering that the non-negativity of concentration distribution and absorption spectra of the chromophores as well as the sparsity of concentration image of exogenous contrast agent in the gradient domain, we herein propose a modified MSPAT implementation that utilizes a non-negative matrix factorization iterative reconstruction framework with the support of a priori information of spectral signature of oxy-/deoxy-hemoglobin and valid sparsity regularization during the iteration. Consequently, the spectral signature of the exogenous contrast agent and the concentration distribution of each chromophore can be recovered simultaneously. The proposed approach has been validated by simulation and in vivo experiments, exhibiting promising performances in image fidelity even when the multi-wavelength photoacoustic tomographic images used for spectral unmixing are affected by noise or reconstruction artifacts. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

To overcome the drawback of reduced tactile feedback, real-time tissue classification could be of great benefit. In this ex vivo study, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) was used to distinguish tumor tissue from healthy surrounding tissue. A sample of fat, healthy colorectal wall, and tumor tissue was collected per patient and imaged using two hyperspectral cameras, covering the wavelength range from 400 to 1700 nm. The data were randomly divided into a training (75%) and test (25%) set. After feature reduction, a quadratic classifier and support vector machine were used to distinguish the three tissue types. Tissue samples of 32 patients were imaged using both hyperspectral cameras. The accuracy to distinguish the three tissue types using both hyperspectral cameras was 0.88 (STD = 0.13) on the test dataset. When the accuracy was determined per patient, a mean accuracy of 0.93 (STD = 0.12) was obtained on the test dataset. This study shows the potential of using HSI in colorectal cancer surgery for fast tissue classification, which could improve clinical outcome.

Unfortunately, the wide range of image distortions that arise during flexible endoscopy in the clinic have made integration of HSI challenging. To address this challenge, we demonstrate a hyperspectral endoscope (HySE) that simultaneously records intrinsically co-registered hyperspectral and standard-of-care white light images, which allows image distortions to be compensated computationally and an accurate hyperspectral data cube to be reconstructed as the endoscope moves in the lumen. Evaluation of HySE performance shows excellent spatial, spectral and temporal resolution and high colour fidelity. Application of HySE enables: quantification of blood oxygenation levels in tissue mimicking phantoms; differentiation of spectral profiles from normal and pathological ex vivo human tissues; and recording of hyperspectral data under freehand motion within an intact ex vivo pig oesophagus model. HySE therefore shows potential for enabling HSI in clinical endoscopy. © 2019, The Author(s).","Nature Publishing Group","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Thus, our objective in this study was to characterize the ability of short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging to detect moisture levels as a surrogate for tissue viability with resolution to differentiate between burns of various depths. To accomplish our aim, we constructed an imaging system consisting of a broad-band Tungsten light source; 1,200-, 1,650-, 1,940-, and 2,250-nm wavelength filters; and a specialized SWIR camera. We initially used agar slabs to provide a baseline spectrum for SWIR light imaging and demonstrated the differential absorbance at the multiple wavelengths, with 1,940 nm being the highest absorbed wavelength. These spectral bands were then demonstrated to detect levels of moisture in inorganic and in vivo mice models. The multiwavelength SWIR imaging approach was used to diagnose depth of burns using an in vivo porcine burn model. Healthy and injured skin regions were imaged 72 hours after short (20 seconds) and long (60 seconds) burn application, and biopsies were extracted from those regions for histologic analysis. Burn depth analysis based on collagen coagulation histology confirmed the formation of superficial and deep burns. SWIR multispectral reflectance imaging showed enhanced intensity levels in long burned regions, which correlated with histology and distinguished between superficial and deep burns. This SWIR imaging method represents a novel, real-time method to objectively distinguishing superficial from deep burns. © 2019 by the Wound Healing Society","Blackwell Publishing Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Clinical decision-making and prognosis is the thickness of melanoma into the tissue. Another feature is that the cancer that can occur anywhere on the body, including the face, chest, thigh, soles, and groin, and its size is also very diverse. Here, we developed a hand-held scanner and obtained 3D photoacoustic images of in vivo human melanoma by using multispectral real-time clinical photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging system with the scanner. The scanner allowed wide-field scanning of 3.8 cm (transducer aperture size) × 3 cm (scanning range). Four patients were recruited to obtain photoacoustic melanoma images of various sites (thigh, sole, etc.), types (in situ, invasive, etc.) and sizes (sub-mm to cm). Five wavelengths were used to perform spectral unmixing. The penetration depth of melanoma was successfully confirmed by the multispectral photoacoustic images. The melanoma depth measured by photoacoustic imaging was significantly similar to histopathologic results obtained after excision (mean absolute error = 0.6 mm). In this study, we acquired small-to-large size and various types of melanoma multispectral photoacoustic images in vivo. We hope that this study will be an additional criterion for histopathological results that may have a positive impact on the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of melanomas. © 2020 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Therefore, the near-infrared spectrum of each component was collected from the sliced section of the human carotid plaque obtained with endarterectomy and the optical characteristics were confirmed in several wavelengths. Based on this information, we assessed the diagnostic accuracy for ex vivo chemogram in each plaque component created with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), using multiple wavelengths. The chemogram projected on the actual image of plaque was created based on light intensity and transmittance change at three wavelengths. The wavelengths that were mainly were 1440, 1620, 1730, and 1930 nm. We evaluated the accuracy of histological diagnosis in chemogram compared with pathological findings, analyzing interobserver agreement with k-statistics. The chemograms that we created depicted the components of fibrous tissue, smooth muscle, lipid tissue, intraplaque hemorrhage, and calcification. Diagnostic odds ratio in each component was as follows: 259.6 in fibrous tissue, 144 in smooth muscle, 1123.5 in lipid tissue, 29.3 in intraplaque hemorrhage, and 136.3 in calcification. The κ-statistics revealed that four components, excluding intraplaque hemorrhage, had substantial or almost perfect agreement. Thus, this study demonstrated the feasibility of using chemogram focused on specific component during the histological assessment of atherosclerotic plaques, highlighting its potential diagnostic ability. Chemograms of various target components can be created by combining multiple wavelengths. This technology may prove to be useful in improving the histological assessment of plaque using NIRS. © 2019 by The Japan Neurosurgical Society.","Japan Neurosurgical Society","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In order to overcome this, a variety of methods have been developed using complex microfluidic devices to reduce the liquid sample path length. However, these devices are often custom made needing both specialised equipment and detailed fabrication steps. Here we show the novel utilisation of a liquid-air interface configuration and a negative contrast imaging device (NCI) reflectance imaging system for the collection of spectral data from live cells within an in vitro environment. Spectral differences were observed between two different cell densities, both in the presence and absence of cell culture media. Additionally, differences were observed between control and test cultures exposed to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to induce cell apoptosis. The NCI system acquired data in the 2.5 – 3.5 µm spectral region, at a spectral sampling interval of 10 nm.

The principal treatment is surgical removal where a complete tumor resection is crucial to reduce the recurrence and mortality rate. Intraoperative tumor imaging enables surgeons to objectively visualize the malignant lesion to maximize the tumor removal with healthy safe margins. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an emerging imaging modality for cancer detection, which can augment surgical tumor inspection, currently limited to subjective visual inspection. In this paper, we aim to investigate HSI for automated cancer detection during image-guided surgery, because it can provide quantitative information about light interaction with biological tissues and exploit the potential for malignant tissue discrimination. The proposed solution forms a novel framework for automated tongue-cancer detection, explicitly exploiting HSI, which particularly uses the spectral variations in specific bands describing the cancerous tissue properties. The method follows a machine-learning based classification, employing linear support vector machine (SVM), and offers a superior sensitivity and a significant decrease in computation time. The model evaluation is on 7 ex-vivo specimens of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, with known histology. The HSI combined with the proposed classification reaches a sensitivity of 94%, specificity of 68% and area under the curve (AUC) of 92%. This feasibility study paves the way for introducing HSI as a non-invasive imaging aid for cancer detection and increase of the effectiveness of surgical oncology. © 2019 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

The reconstructed images at chromophore-sensitive wavebands are used to map the skin features of interest.

Recurrence rates after surgery can be as high as 55%, if residual cancer is present. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is evaluated for detection of SCC in ex-vivo surgical specimens. Several machine learning methods are investigated, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a spectral-spatial classification framework based on support vector machines. Quantitative results demonstrate that additional data preprocessing and unsupervised segmentation can improve CNN results to achieve optimal performance. The methods are trained in two paradigms, with and without specular glare. Classifying regions that include specular glare degrade the overall results, but the combination of the CNN probability maps and unsupervised segmentation using a majority voting method produces an area under the curve value of 0.81 [0.80, 0.83]. As the wavelengths of light used in HSI can penetrate different depths into biological tissue, cancer margins may change with depth and create uncertainty in the ground truth. Through serial histological sectioning, the variance in the cancer margin with depth is investigated and paired with qualitative classification heat maps using the methods proposed for the testing group of SCC patients. The results determined that the validity of the top section alone as the ground truth may be limited to 1 to 2 mm.

Autofluorescence within the eye is associated with several disorders, such as Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) which is a leading cause of central vision loss. Its pathogenesis is incompletely understood, but endogenous fluorophores in retinal tissue might play a role. Hyperspectral fluorescence microscopy of ex-vivo retinal tissue can be used to determine the fluorescence emission spectra of these fluorophores. Comparisons of spectra in healthy and diseased tissues can provide important insights into the pathogenesis of AMD. However, the spectrum from each pixel of the hyperspectral image is a superposition of spectra from multiple overlapping tissue components. As spectra cannot be negative, there is a need for a non-negative blind source separation model to isolate individual spectra. We propose a tensor formulation by leveraging multiple excitation wavelengths to excite the tissue sample. Arranging images from different excitation wavelengths as a tensor, a non-negative tensor decomposition can be performed to recover a provably unique low-rank model with factors representing emission and excitation spectra of these materials and corresponding abundance maps of autofluorescent substances in the tissue sample. We iteratively impute missing values common in fluorescence measurements using Expectation-Maximization and use L2 regularization to reduce ill-posedness. Further, we present a framework for performing group hypothesis testing on hyperspectral images, finding significant differences in spectra between AMD and control groups in the peripheral macula. In the absence of ground truth, i.e. molecular identification of fluorophores, we provide a rigorous validation of chosen methods on both synthetic and real images where fluorescence spectra are known. These methodologies can be applied to the study of other pathologies presenting autofluorescence that can be captured by hyperspectral imaging. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Elsevier B.V.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Raman spectroscopy has shown its potential for non-invasive and label-free determination of bio-molecular compositions, aiding the post-mortem diagnosis of pathological tissue. Here, we investigated whether conventional Raman spectroscopy could be used for the detection of amyloid beta deposits in fixed, ex vivo human brain tissue, taken from the frontal cortex region. We examined the spectra and spectral maps of three severe AD cases and two healthy control cases and compared their spectral outcome among each other as well as to recent results in the literature obtained with various spectroscopic techniques. After hyperspectral Raman mapping, Aβ plaques were visualized using Thioflavin-S staining on the exact same tissue sections. As a result, we show that tiny diffuse or tangled-like morphological structures, visible under microscopic conditions on unstained tissue and often but erroneously assumed to be deposits of Aβ, are instead usually an aggregation of highly auto-fluorescent lipofuscin granulates without any, or limited, plaque or plaque-like association. The occurrence of these auto-fluorescent particles is equally distributed in both AD and healthy control cases. Therefore, they cannot be used as possible criteria for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. Furthermore, a unique plaque-specific/Aβ spectrum could not be determined even after possible spectral interferences were carefully removed. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.","Royal Society of Chemistry","Article","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

We present a method to emulate the spectral range and resolution of a variety of multispectral imagers, based on in-vivo data acquired from spatial frequency domain spectroscopy (SFDS). This approach simulates spectral responses over 400 to 1100 nm. Comparing emulated data with full SFDS spectra of in-vivo tissue affords the opportunity to evaluate whether the sparse spectral content of these imagers can (1) account for all sources of optical contrast present (completeness) and (2) robustly separate and quantify sources of optical contrast (crosstalk). We validate the approach over a range of tissue-simulating phantoms, comparing the SFDS-based emulated spectra against measurements from an independently characterized multispectral imager. Emulated results match the imager across all phantoms (>3% absorption, >1% reduced scattering). In-vivo test cases (burn wounds and photoaging) illustrate how SFDS can be used to evaluate different multispectral imagers. This approach provides an in-vivo measurement method to evaluate the performance of multispectral imagers specific to their targeted clinical applications and can assist in the design and optimization of new spectral imaging devices. © The Authors.","SPIE","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, the opaque skull of a mouse has to be either opened or thinned in an invasive way to attain an adequate imaging depth in the brain. Mild skull optical clearing is highly desired, but its chemical mechanism is far from being understood. Here, we unraveled the molecular process underlying optical clearing of the mouse skull by label-free hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy, thereby discovering the optimal clearing strategy to turn a turbid skull into a transparent skull window. Furthermore, we demonstrated in vivo three-photon imaging of vascular structures as deep as 850 μm in the cortex of the mouse brain.

Pathology diagnosis is usually done by a pathologist observing tissue-stained glass slide under a microscope. Method: Multispectral photoacoustic (MPA) specimen imaging has proven successful in differentiating photoacoustic (PA) signal characteristics between a histopathology-defined cancer region and normal tissue. This is mainly due to its ability to efficiently map oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin contents from MPA images and key features for cancer detection. A fully automated deep learning algorithm is purposed, which learns to detect the presence of malignant tissue in freshly excised ex vivo human thyroid and prostate tissue specimens using the three-dimensional MPA dataset. The proposed automated deep learning model consisted of the convolutional neural network architecture, which extracts spatially colocated features, and a softmax function, which detects thyroid and prostate cancer tissue at once. This is one of the first deep learning models, to the best of our knowledge, to detect the presence of cancer in excised thyroid and prostate tissue of humans at once based on PA imaging. Result: The area under the curve (AUC) was used as a metric to evaluate the predictive performance of the classifier. The proposed model detected the cancer tissue with the AUC of 0.96, which is very promising. Conclusion: This model is an improvement over the previous work using machine learning and deep learning algorithms. This model may have immediate application in cancer screening of the numerous sliced specimens that result from thyroidectomy and prostatectomy. Since the instrument that was used to capture the ex vivo PA images is now being developed for in vivo use, this model may also prove to be a starting point for in vivo PA image analysis for cancer diagnosis. © 2019, CARS.","Springer","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This procedure needs an accurate and real-time monitoring of thermal effects to evaluate and control treatment outcome. In this work, a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technique is proposed as a new and non-invasive method to monitor ablative therapy. HSI provides images of the target object in several spectral bands, hence the reflectance/absorbance spectrum for each pixel. This paper presents a preliminary and original HSI-based analysis of the thermal state in the in vivo porcine liver undergoing laser ablation. In order to compare the spectral response between treated and untreated areas of the organ, proper Regions of Interest (ROIs) were chosen on the hyperspectral images; for each ROI, the absorbance variation for the selected wavelengths (i.e., 630, 760, and 960nm, for deoxyhemoglobin, methemoglobin, and water respectively) was assessed. Results obtained during and after laser ablation show that the absorbance of the methemoglobin peaks increases up to 40% in the burned region with respect to the non-ablated one. Conversely, the relative change of deoxyhemoglobin and water peaks is less marked. Based on these results, absorbance threshold values were retrieved and used to visualize the ablation zone on the images. This preliminary analysis suggests that a combination of the absorbance information is essential to achieve a more accurate identification of the ablation region. The results encourage further studies on the correlation between thermal effects and the spectral response of biological tissues undergoing thermal ablation, for final clinical use. © 2019 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, the resistance mechanisms have not been well understood due to a lack of suitable tools for dynamic observation of the interplay between antibiotics and biofilm. In this work, with the use of rapid hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering microscopy associated with an aryl-alkyne-based Raman tag synthesized, we investigate dynamic interactions between vancomycin and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) biofilm to gain new insights into the resistance mechanisms of the biofilm. Methods: We utilize spectral focusing hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering microscopy ensued with multivariate curve resolution analysis to spectrally decompose S. aureus biofilm into its major components (i.e., bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances). Concurrently, vancomycin is conjugated with aryl-alkyne Raman tag (Raman peak at 2218 cm-1) for in vivo tracking of its uptake into biofilm without tissue interference. Results: We find that vancomycin penetration is a non-uniform diffusion process with penetration depths limited by the preferential affinity to the cell clusters. Semi-quantitative analysis shows that the majority of vancomycin binds to the bacteria, achieving intracellular concentrations of up to 4- to 10- fold higher than the administered dosage. The diffusion constant of ~3.16 µm2/min based on the diffusion and antibiotic binding equations is obtained that well accounts for the antibiotic penetration into the biofilm. SRS longitudinal monitoring of antibiotic effect on the growth of biofilms shows that the antibiotics can eradicate the upper layer of the biofilm exposed to sufficient dosages, while the lower layer of the biofilm at a sub-inhibitory dose remains viable, eventually re-growing to significant bio-volume. Conclusion: The Raman-tagged hyperspectral SRS microscopy developed is a powerful imaging tool for dynamic monitoring of inhibitory effects of antibiotics on the growing biofilm in vivo, which would facilitate the formulation of new antibiotics for more effective treatments of bacterial infections in near future. © Ivyspring International Publisher.","Ivyspring International Publisher","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Herein, it is the first report to investigate the ability of multispectral photoacoustic imaging (PAI) to estimate the distribution of protease cleavage sites inside living tumor tissue by using an activatable photoacoustic (PA) probe. Procedures: The protease MMP-2 is selected as the target. In this probe, gold nanocages (GNCs) with an absorption peak at ~ 800 nm and fluorescent dye molecules with an absorption peak at ~ 680 nm are conjugated via a specific enzymatic peptide substrate. Upon enzymatic activation by MMP-2, the peptide substrate is cleaved and the chromophores are released. Due to the different retention speeds of large GNCs and small dye molecules, the probe alters its intrinsic absorption profile and produces a distinct change in the PA signal. A multispectral PAI technique that can distinguish different chromophores based on intrinsic PA spectral signatures is applied to estimate the signal composition changes and indicate the cleavage interaction sites. Finally, the multispectral PAI technique with the activatable probe is tested in solution, cultured cells, and a subcutaneous tumor model in vivo. Results: Our experiment in solution with enzyme ± inhibitor, cell culture ± inhibitor, and in vivo tumor model with administration of the developed probe ± inhibitor demonstrated the probe was cleaved by the targeted enzyme. Particularly, the in vivo estimation of the cleavage site distribution was validated with the result of ex vivo immunohistochemistry analysis. Conclusions: This novel synergy of the multispectral PAI technique and the activatable probe is a potential strategy for the distribution estimation of tumor protease activity in vivo. © 2018, World Molecular Imaging Society.","Springer New York LLC","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The diffuse infiltration into the surrounding normal brain by these tumors makes their accurate identification by the naked eye difficult. Since surgery is the common treatment for brain cancer, an accurate radical resection of the tumor leads to improved survival rates for patients. However, the identification of the tumor boundaries during surgery is challenging. Hyperspectral imaging is a noncontact, non-ionizing and non-invasive technique suitable for medical diagnosis. This study presents the development of a novel classification method taking into account the spatial and spectral characteristics of the hyperspectral images to help neurosurgeons to accurately determine the tumor boundaries in surgical-time during the resection, avoiding excessive excision of normal tissue or unintentionally leaving residual tumor. The algorithm proposed in this study to approach an efficient solution consists of a hybrid framework that combines both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. Firstly, a supervised pixel-wise classification using a Support Vector Machine classifier is performed. The generated classification map is spatially homogenized using a one-band representation of the HS cube, employing the Fixed Reference t-Stochastic Neighbors Embedding dimensional reduction algorithm, and performing a K-Nearest Neighbors filtering. The information generated by the supervised stage is combined with a segmentation map obtained via unsupervised clustering employing a Hierarchical K-Means algorithm. The fusion is performed using a majority voting approach that associates each cluster with a certain class. To evaluate the proposed approach, five hyperspectral images of surface of the brain affected by glioblastoma tumor in vivo from five different patients have been used. The final classification maps obtained have been analyzed and validated by specialists.

The aim of this study was to propose a novel imaging strategy for quantitative three-dimensional (3D) evaluation of hypoxia in a small animal model of NPC. Methods: A carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)-specific molecular probe (CAIX-800) was developed for imaging of hypoxia. Mouse models of subcutaneous, orthotopic, and spontaneous lymph node metastasis from NPC (5 mice per group) were established to assess the imaging strategy. A multi-modality imaging method that consisted of a hybrid combination of fluorescence molecular tomography-computed tomography (FMT-CT) and multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) was used for 3D quantitative evaluation of tumour hypoxia. Magnetic resonance imaging, histological examination, and immunohistochemical analysis were used as references for comparison and validation. Results: In the early stage of NPC (2 weeks after implantation), FMT-CT enabled precise 3D localisation of the hypoxia biomarker with high sensitivity. At the advanced stage (6 weeks after implantation), MSOT allowed multispectral analysis of the biomarker and haemoglobin molecules with high resolution. The combination of high sensitivity and high resolution from FMT-CT and MSOT could not only detect hypoxia in small-sized NPCs but also visualise the heterogeneity of hypoxia in 3D. Conclusions: Integration of FMT-CT and MSOT could allow comprehensive and quantifiable evaluation of hypoxia in NPC. These findings may potentially benefit patients with NPC undergoing radiotherapy in the future.

By using real-time non-ionizing imaging techniques, such as hyperspectral imaging (HSI), the spectral signature of the tissue is analyzed allowing tissue classification, thereby improving tumor boundary discrimination during surgery. More particularly, since infrared penetrates deeper in the tissue than visible light, the use of an imaging sensor sensitive to the near-infrared wavelength range would also allow the visualization of structures slightly beneath the tissue surface. This enables the visualization of tumors and vessel boundaries prior to surgery, thereby preventing the damaging of tissue structures. In this study, we investigate the use of Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) and HSI for brain tissue classification, by extracting spectral features from the near infra-red range. The applied method for classification is the linear Support Vector Machine (SVM). The study is conducted on ex-vivo porcine brain tissue, which is analyzed and classified as either white or gray matter. The DRS combined with the proposed classification reaches a sensitivity and specificity of 96%, while HSI reaches a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 93%. This feasibility study shows the potential of DRS and HSI for automated tissue classification, and serves as a fjrst step towards clinical use for tumor detection deeper inside the tissue. © 2020 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

We examined the effect of cancer cell-specific MHCII (csMHCII) expression in lung adenocarcinoma on T cell recruitment to tumors and response to anti- PD-1 therapy using two orthotopic immunocompetent murine models of non-small cell lung cancer: CMT167 (CMT) and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC).We previously showed that CMT167 tumors are eradicated by anti-PD1 therapy, whereas LLC tumors are resistant. RNA sequencing analysis of cancer cells recovered from tumors revealed that csMHCII correlated with response to anti- PD1 therapy, with immunotherapy-sensitive CMT167 cells being csMHCII positive, whereas resistant LLC cells were csMHCII negative. To test the functional effects of csMHCII, MHCII expression was altered on the cancer cells through loss- and gain-offunction of CIITA, a master regulator of the MHCII pathway. Loss of CIITA in CMT167 decreased csMHCII and converted tumors from anti-PD-1 sensitive to anti-PD-1 resistant. This was associated with lower levels of Th1 cytokines, decreased T cell infiltration, increased B cell numbers, and decreased macrophage recruitment. Conversely, overexpression of CIITA in LLC cells resulted in csMHCII in vitro and in vivo. Enforced expression of CIITA increased T cell infiltration and sensitized tumors to anti- PD-1 therapy. csMHCII expression was also examined in a subset of surgically resected human lung adenocarcinomas by multispectral imaging, which provided a survival benefit and positively correlated with T cell infiltration. These studies demonstrate a functional role for csMHCII in regulating T cell infiltration and sensitivity to anti-PD-1. © 2020 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.","American Association of Immunologists","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

As Aβ has a wavelength-dependent effect on light scatter, we investigate the potential for in vivo retinal hyperspectral imaging to serve as a biomarker of brain Aβ. Significant differences in the retinal reflectance spectra are found between individuals with high Aβ burden on brain PET imaging and mild cognitive impairment (n = 15), and age-matched PET-negative controls (n = 20). Retinal imaging scores are correlated with brain Aβ loads. The findings are validated in an independent cohort, using a second hyperspectral camera. A similar spectral difference is found between control and 5xFAD transgenic mice that accumulate Aβ in the brain and retina.

Hypoxia is a feature of the tumor microenvironment that reduces efficacy of immuno-and chemotherapies, resulting in poor clinical outcomes. Lactococcus lactis is a facultative anaerobic gram-positive lactic acid bacterium (LAB) that is Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS). Recently, the use of LAB as a delivery vehicle has emerged as an alternative strategy to deliver therapeutic molecules; therefore, we investigated whether L. lactis can target and localize within melanoma hypoxic niches. To simulate hypoxic conditions in vitro, melanoma cells A2058, A375 and MeWo were cultured in a chamber with a gas mixture of 5% CO2, 94% N2 and 1% O2. Among the cell lines tested, MeWo cells displayed greater survival rates when compared to A2058 and A375 cells. Co-cultures of L. lactis expressing GFP or mCherry and MeWo cells revealed that L. lactis efficiently express the transgenes under hypoxic conditions. Moreover, multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), and near infrared (NIR) imaging of tumor-bearing BALB/c mice revealed that the intravenous injection of either L. lactis expressing β-galactosidase (β-gal) or infrared fluorescent protein (IRFP713) results in the establishment of the recombinant bacteria within tumor hypoxic niches. Overall, our data suggest that L. lactis represents an alternative strategy to target and deliver therapeutic molecules into the tumor hypoxic microenvironment. © 2020 by the authors.

Epilepsy surgery may be considered in patients who are resistant to drug treatment, and several tests are used during pre-operative planning to locate the epileptic focus to be resected (MRI, PET, SPECT, EEG, MEG). In some cases, intracranial EEG monitoring or intraoperative electrocorticography is required to confirm and better delineate the area to be resected. Despite available tests, epilepsy surgery outcome remains modest. We present a multimodal imaging platform connected to a neurosurgical microscope allowing intraoperative detection of intrinsic optical brain biomarkers for surgical guidance during epilepsy surgery. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) allows detection of the hemodynamic response associated with epileptic activity, spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) is used for optical properties reconstruction (absorption and reduced scattering), and auto-fluorescence imaging (AFI) allows metabolic markers identification. Validation of SFDI and AFI systems was performed on optical phantoms. Acquisitions on ex vivo tissue samples demonstrate the capabilities of the system to produce fluorescence intensity maps, calibrated with optical properties obtained from SFDI to account for tissue attenuation. In vivo acquisition during epilepsy surgery with HSI allows characterization of the hemodynamic response associated with epileptic spikes. © SPIE-OSA 2019","OSA - The Optical Society","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Quantitative T2 mapping can be beneficial for tissue characterization and early diagnosis of tissue pathology but current T2 mapping techniques lack the capability to image near metal hardware. A novel multi-spectral T2 mapping technique is proposed to address this unmet need. Methods : A T2 mapping pulse sequence based on routinely implemented 3D multi-spectral imaging (3D-MSI) pulse sequences is described and demonstrated. The 3D-MSI pulse sequence is altered to acquire images at 2 echo times. Phantom and knee experiments were performed to assess the quantitative capabilities of the sequence in comparison to a commercially available T2 mapping sequence. The technique was demonstrated for use within a clinical protocol in 2 total hip arthroplasty (THA) cases to assess T2 variations within the periprosthetic joint space. Results : The proposed multi-spectral T2 mapping technique agreed, within experimental errors, with T2 values derived from a commercially available clinical standard of care T2 mapping sequence. The same level of agreement was observed in quantitative phantoms and in vivo experiments. In THA cases, the method was able to assess variations of T2 within the synovial envelope immediately adjacent to implant interfaces.

Due to the pronounced absorption features of lipids in the extended near-infrared region (1650−1850 nm), visualisation and identification of lipids become possible using multi-spectral photoacoustic (optoacoustic) microscopy. However, the spectroscopic studies in this spectral region require lasers that can produce high pulse energies over a broad spectral bandwidth to efficiently excite strong photoacoustic signals. The most well-known laser sources capable of satisfying the multi-spectral photoacoustic microscopy requirements (tunability and pulse energy) are tunable nanosecond optical parametric oscillators. However, these lasers have an inherently large footprint, thus preventing their use in compact microscopy systems. Besides, they exhibit low-repetition rates. Here, we demonstrate a compact all-fibre, high pulse energy supercontinuum laser that covers a spectral range from 1440 to 1870 nm with a 7 ns pulse duration and total energy of 18.3 μJ at a repetition rate of 100 kHz. Using the developed high-pulse energy source, we perform multi-spectral photoacoustic microscopy imaging of lipids, both ex vivo on adipose tissue and in vivo to study the development of Xenopus laevis tadpoles, using six different excitation bands over the first overtone transition of C–H vibration bonds (1650−1850 nm). © 2020","Elsevier GmbH","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

While ultrasound contains anatomical information for lesion detection, MSOT provides functional information based on intrinsic tissue chromophores. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of combined ultrasound/MSOT imaging of breast cancer in patients compared to healthy volunteers. Methods: Imaging was performed using a handheld MSOT system for clinical use in healthy volunteers (n = 6) and representative patients with histologically confirmed invasive breast carcinoma (n = 5) and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS, n = 2). MSOT values for haemoglobin and oxygen saturation were assessed at 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 cm depth and selected wavelengths between 700 and 850 nm. Results: Reproducible signals were obtained in all wavelengths with consistent MSOT signals in superficial tissue in breasts of healthy individuals. In contrast, we found increased signals for haemoglobin in invasive carcinoma, suggesting a higher perfusion of the tumour and tumour environment. For DCIS, MSOT values showed only little variation compared to healthy tissue. Conclusions: This preliminary MSOT breast imaging study provided stable, reproducible data on tissue composition and physiological properties, potentially enabling differentiation of solid malignant and healthy tissue. Key Points: • A handheld MSOT probe enables real-time molecular imaging of the breast. • MSOT of healthy controls provides a reproducible reference for pathology identification. • MSOT parameters allows for differentiation of invasive carcinoma and healthy tissue. © 2017, European Society of Radiology.","Springer Verlag","Article","","Scopus"

A specialized multispectral analysis of the data obtained was applied by using excitation in broad spectral range, covering ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared spectral range, that contribute considerably to: (1) fundamental determination of tumour tissues' spectral properties, and (2) to increase the accuracy in determining the type of cutaneous pathology.

Typical samples can range from invitro and in-vivo tissue samples, living cells, quantum structures (dots, wires), material surfaces, microfluidics and nano-crystals. Enhancing traditional microscopy systems by coupling a spectrometer to them offers the added dimension of higher density multichannel spectral information. This information can unlock deeper chemical, dynamic and conformational information on various materials. Different approaches are taken in configuring such systems from the commercially available fully integrated a€black box' tailored for specific types of application and/or spectral modalities, to the in-house purpose-built modular systems where the end-users build and integrate their own system from various individual components. There are advantages and limitations with either approach. This article outlines various aspects and implications for taking the modular approach to constructing one's microspectroscopy setup. In particular, examples are illustrated where Andor Technology's dedicated, highly configurable interfaces for microspectroscopy utilize various optical and optomechanical components to facilitate flexible direct and indirect coupling of the spectrometer to the microscope. Software options are discussed for control of the system and data collection/processing to allow for multitrack and hyperspectral imaging, as well as fast chemical mapping. Sensitivity is a key technical challenge in most scenarios when dealing with such small sample volumes; an outline of where the latest CCD, EMCCD, and sCMOS technology offers benefits in sensitivity are also discussed. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Method: 2DMSI was optimized for temperature sensitivity and applied to monitor focus ultrasound surgery (FUS) sonications near metallic hardware in phantoms and ex vivo porcine muscle tissue. Further, we evaluated its temperature sensitivity for in vivo muscle in patients without metallic hardware. In addition, we performed a comparison of temperature sensitivity between 2DMSI and conventional proton-resonance-frequency-shift (PRFS) thermometry at different distances from metal devices and different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Results: 2DMSI thermometry enabled visualization of short ultrasound sonications near metallic hardware. Calibration using in vivo muscle yielded a constant temperature sensitivity for temperatures below 43 °C. For an off-resonance coverage of ± 6 kHz, we achieved a temperature sensitivity of 1.45%/K, resulting in a minimum detectable temperature change of ∼2.5 K for an SNR of 100 with a temporal resolution of 6 s per frame. Conclusion: The proposed 2DMSI thermometry has the potential to allow MR-guided FUS treatments of patients with metallic hardware and therefore expand its reach to a larger patient population.

Here, we describe an optical-imaging instrument that integrates a visible multispectral imaging system with the detection of NIR-II and NIR-I (700–900 nm in wavelength) fluorescence (by using the dye indocyanine green) for aiding the fluorescence-guided surgical resection of primary and metastatic liver tumours in 23 patients. We found that, compared with NIR-I imaging, intraoperative NIR-II imaging provided a higher tumour-detection sensitivity (100% versus 90.6%; with 95% confidence intervals of 89.1%–100% and 75.0%–98.0%, respectively), a higher tumour-to-normal-liver-tissue signal ratio (5.33 versus 1.45) and an enhanced tumour-detection rate (56.41% versus 46.15%).

Often, FUS is carried out in conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate BBB opening to gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents. Although MRI allows direct visualization of the distribution of gadolinium-based contrast agents in the brain parenchyma, it does not allow measurements of the distribution of other molecules crossing the BBB. Therapeutic molecules (e.g., monoclonal antibodies) are much different in size than MRI contrast agents and have been found to have different distributions in the brain after FUS-mediated BBB opening. In the work described here, we combined in vivo MRI and ex vivo multispectral fluorescence imaging to compare the distributions of MRI contrast and dextran molecules of different molecular weights (3, 70 and 500 kDa) after FUS-mediated BBB opening through a range of ultrasound pressures (0.18–0.46 MPa) in laboratory mice. The volume of brain exposed was calculated from the MRI and fluorescence images and was significantly dependent on both molecular weight and ultrasound pressure. Diffusion coefficients of the different-molecular-weight dextran molecules in the brain parenchyma were also calculated from the fluorescence images and were negatively correlated with the molecular weight of the dextran molecules.

While ex vivo and early studies suggest promising clinical application, there are no standardized parameters for defining presence of melanoma metastases. Methods: Following flank/hindlimb melanoma induction in BRaf-PTEN transgenic mice, bilateral inguinal lymph nodes (LN) were imaged in vivo at 4 to 8 weeks using PAI. Fourteen diagnostic parameters for in vivo detection of LN metastases were compared using the receiver operating characteristic and area-under-the-curve (AUC). Limits of detectability were assessed in ex vivo and in vitro phantom studies. Results: Forty-nine LNs were imaged in 25 mice. Among metastatic LNs, tumor size ranged from scattered cells to 2.8 mm. The strongest predictor of LN metastasis was the ratio of peak 10% PA melanin signal in the LN compared with adjacent soft tissue (median 4.22 for positive LNs vs 1.07 for negative LNs, P < 0.0001). The AUC was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.90-1.00). In phantom studies, B16 tumor cells were detectable at a concentration of 10 to 25 cells/μL and at a tissue depth of 2.5-3 cm. Conclusions: We identified a simple, objective diagnostic parameter for identifying melanoma LN metastases in vivo.

This imaging modality is based on the principle that each material provides different responses to light reflection, absorption, and scattering across the electromagnetic spectrum. Due to these properties, it is possible to differentiate and identify the different materials/substances presented in a certain scene by their spectral signature. Over the last two decades, HSI has demonstrated potential to become a powerful tool to study and identify several diseases in the medical field, being a non-contact, non-ionizing, and a label-free imaging modality. In this review, the use of HSI as an imaging tool for the analysis and detection of cancer is presented. The basic concepts related to this technology are detailed. The most relevant, state-of-the-art studies that can be found in the literature using HSI for cancer analysis are presented and summarized, both in-vivo and ex-vivo.

However, conventional systems are typically bulky and function with two cameras. To overcome these issues, we developed an economical home-built fluorescence imaging device based on a single RGB-IR sensor that can acquire both color and fluorescence images simultaneously. The technical feasibility of RGB-IR imaging was verified ex vivo in chicken breast tissue using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), cyanine 5 (Cy5), and indocyanine green (ICG) as fluorescent agents. The minimum sensitivities for FITC, Cy5, and ICG were 0.200 μM, 0.130 μM, and 0.065 μM, respectively. In addition, we validated the fluorescence imaging of this device in vitro during a minimally invasive procedure using smURFP-labeled probiotics, which emit a spectrum similar to that of Cy5. Our preliminary study of the ex vivo tissue suggests that Cy5 and ICG are good candidates for deep tissue imaging. In addition, the tumor-specific amplification process was visualized using cancer cells incubated with probiotics that had been labeled with a fluorescent protein. Our approach indicates the potential for in vivo screening of tumors in rodent tumor models. © 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.","OSA - The Optical Society","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Biodistribution analysis by optical imaging is desirable due to its low cost, wide accessibility, and high-throughput nature, but it is substantially less accurate than isotopic and chemical techniques. In this work, we developed multimodal probes for optical and nuclear imaging to analyze the quantitative limits of optical contrast in the red and near-infrared spectra for polysaccharide nanocarriers targeting macrophage cells. Probes incorporating three zwitterionic fluorophores together with radioactive copper distributed diffusely to optically dissimilar tissues that were either white (visceral adipose tissue) or dark red (liver and spleen) in obese rodents. We used in vivo positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging, in vivo hyperspectral tomographic fluorescence imaging, and ex vivo optical and isotopic analyses to determine correlations between optical and nuclear signals. PET imaging strongly correlated with standardized ex vivo methods for all tissue types, whereas no fluorescence signals exhibited substantial accuracy in quantification or localization in vivo. Optical imaging of resected tissues was most accurate in the 700 nm wavelength window, but only in white tissues. This work suggests that fluorescence can be used to measure diffuse probe distribution in white tissues over time or across animals, but not red tissues and not deep in the body. This work also highlights the importance of choosing validated experimental protocols and describes how optical measurements are impacted by fluorophore class and spectral properties, tissue properties, and imaging workflow.

Theory and Methods: A multi-echo CSE technique is applied for spectral separation of the perfluorocarbon perfluoro-15-crown-5-ether (PFCE) and isoflurane (ISO) based on their chemical shifts at 4.7 T. Cramér-Rao lower bound analysis is used to identify echo combinations with optimal signal-to-noise performance. Signal contributions are fit with a multispectral fluorine signal model using a non-linear least squares estimation reconstruction directly from k-space data. This CSE approach is tested in fluorine-19 phantoms and in a mouse with a 2D and 3D spoiled gradient-echo acquisition using multiple echo times determined from Cramér-Rao lower bound analysis. Results: Cramér-Rao lower bound analysis for PFCE and ISO separation shows signal-to-noise performance is maximized with a 0.33 ms echo separation. A linear behavior (R2 = 0.987) between PFCE signal and known relative PFCE volume is observed in CSE reconstructed images using a mixed PFCE/ISO phantom. Effective spatial and spectral separation of PFCE and ISO is shown in phantoms and in vivo. Conclusion: Feasibility of a gradient-echo CSE acquisition and image reconstruction approach with optimized noise performance is demonstrated through fluorine-19 MRI of PFCE with effective removal of ISO signal contributions.

Here, we aim to customize a label-free multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) method and systematically survey the fate of oxidized SWCNHs (SWCNHox) following different exposure routes by whole body imaging. Methods: Mice were given a suspension of SWCNHox with an average size of 136.4 nm via four different administration routes, and then imaged by MSOT. Results: After oral gavage, SWCNHox were mainly distributed in the gastrointestinal tract then excreted through the gut. Compared with the observation post first dosing, the accumulation of SWCNHox in the gastrointestinal tract was not obvious even after four-time oral gavage. Almost no SWCNHox were found at detectable levels in kidney, liver, blood and spleen. Following intravenous (iv) injection, SWCNHox were mainly presented and persisted in the spleen and liver, while very little in the kidney and almost none detectable in the intestine. SWCNHox accumulated significantly in the liver and spleen after four IV administrations. Following hypodermic and intramuscular injections, almost no SWCNHox could cross biological barriers and transport to the spleen, kidney or liver, likely due to their very low absorption rate. Almost all SWCNHox remained around the injection sites. For the first time, we have systematically investigated the in vivo fate of SWCNHs in a label-free and real-time manner. Conclusion: The findings of this study provide insights into the selection of appropriate exposure routes for potential biomedical applications of carbon nanomaterials. © 2019 Shi et al.","Dove Medical Press Ltd.","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

We conducted a systematic review of surgical in vivo label-free multispectral and HSI systems that have been assessed intraoperatively in adult patients, published over a 10-year period to May 2018. We analysed 14 studies including 8 different HSI systems. Current in-vivo HSI systems generate an intraoperative tissue oxygenation map or enable tumour detection. Intraoperative tissue oxygenation measurements may help to predict those patients at risk of postoperative complications and in-vivo intraoperative tissue characterization may be performed with high specificity and sensitivity. All systems utilized a line-scanning or wavelength-scanning method but the spectral range and number of spectral bands employed varied significantly between studies and according to the system's clinical aim. The time to acquire a hyperspectral cube dataset ranged between 5 and 30 seconds. No safety concerns were reported in any studies. A small number of studies have demonstrated the capabilities of intraoperative in-vivo label-free HSI but further work is needed to fully integrate it into the current surgical workflow. © 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, a new non-invasive hyperspectral camera system (TIVITA™) was tested for this purpose in an in vivo animal model. Methods Evaluation of tissue oxygenation during ischemia and upon reperfusion was performed in left hind limb in a rat model (n = 20). Ischemia was induced by clamping and dissection of the superficial femoral artery. Reperfusion of the limb was achieved by microsurgical anastomosis of the dissected artery. Oxygenation parameters of the hind limb were assessed via TIVITA™ before and immediately after clamping and dissection of the artery, 3 and 30 min after reperfusion as well as on postoperative days 1 and 2. Thereby, the non-operated hind limb served as control. As clinical parameters, the refill of the anastomosis as well as the progress of the affected leg were assessed. Results In 12 from 20 cases, TIVITA™ recorded a sufficient reperfusion with oxygenation parameters comparable to baseline or control condition. However, in 8 from 20 cases oxygenation was found impaired after reperfusion causing a re-assessment of the microvascular anastomosis. Thereby, technical problems like stenosis or local thrombosis were found in all cases and were surgically treated leading to an increased tissue oxygenation. Conclusions The TIVITA™ camera system is a valid non-invasive tool to assess tissue perfusion after microvascular anastomosis. As it safely shows problems in oxygenation, it allows the clinician a determined revision of the site in time in order to prevent prolonged ischemia. © 2017","Academic Press Inc.","Article","","Scopus"

In this study, smoothing splines is proposed as an alternative technique to avoid spectral distortion in analysis of hyperspectral uorescence images in the wavelength range 400-1000 nm.

Due to the difference between the optical absorption spectra of deoxygenated and oxygenated hemoglobin, multispectral photoacoustic imaging holds strong potential in noninvasive local blood oxygen saturation imaging. Oxygen saturation imaging is one of the most promising applications of photoacoustic imaging and has been widely explored in studies related to tumor hypoxia, cancer therapy etc. However, clinical translation of this technology has often been limited by bulky and expensive excitation sources. Recently, we introduced a multi-wavelength real-time LED-based photoacoustic/ultrasound imaging system. In this work, potential of this LED-based system in real-time oxygen saturation imaging is demonstrated using an in vivo measurement on a human volunteer. We used ultra-fast switching two-wavelength LED arrays (750nm/850nm) along with a linear-array 7 MHz US probe for the experiments. 2D PA, US, and oxygen saturation imaging were performed on the index finger of a human volunteer. Results demonstrate that LED-based PA imaging system used in this study is promising for generating 2D/3D oxygen saturation maps along with PA and US images in real-time.

A correlation was highlighted between the biomechanical properties detected by Brillouin microscopy and the molecular make-up of Aβ plaques provided by FTIR spectroscopic imaging and Raman microscopy (with correlative immunofluorescence imaging) in this animal model of the disease. In the Brillouin spectra of heterogeneous materials such as biomedical samples, peaks are likely the result of multiple contributions, more or less overlaid on a spatial and spectral scale. The ability to disentangle these contributions is very important as it may give access to discrete components that would otherwise be buried within the Brillouin peak envelope. Here, we applied an unsupervised non-negative matrix factorization method to analyse the spontaneous Brillouin microscopy maps of Aβ plaques in transgenic mouse hippocampal sections. The method has already been proven successful in decomposing chemical images and is applied here for the first time to acoustic maps acquired with a Fabry-Perot Brillouin microscope. We extracted and visualised a decrease in tissue rigidity from the core through to the periphery of the plaque, with spatially distinct components that we assigned to specific entities. This work demonstrates that it is possible to reveal the structure and mechanical properties of Aβ plaques, with details visualized by the projection of the mechanical contrast into a few relevant channels. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Royal Society of Chemistry","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Absorption is normally inferred from measurement of contrast of biological features, such as the vasculature, and so accuracy is degraded by the poorly characterized modulation-transfer function of the imaging optics and overlying tissue. We report how experimental characterization of the spectral variation of the tissue point-spread function and associated objective speckle pattern can be used to characterize the absorption spectrum and chromophore concentration, with a particular emphasis on determination of the ratio of oxygenated to deoxygenated hemoglobin within blood. Absorption measurements are determined purely by the geometry of the experiment, without degradation due to optical aberrations and associated light scatter. The technique offers enhanced and low-cost determination of in vitro or in vivo chromophore characterizations, including blood-gas analysis. © 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement","OSA - The Optical Society","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This technique is label-free, non-invasive and can be implemented with a large field of view (up to several cm2) to image wide areas of biological tissues while providing information on its microstructure. The development of innovative (MPI) systems, able to analyze biological tissues in vivo on human patients, remains an instrumental challenge. Our goal is to build miniaturized and compact full-field MPI systems based on Ferroelectric Liquid Crystals (FLCs) capable of performing a multispectral accurate analysis of biological tissues in vivo. In this work, an innovative approach is showed to realize optimized and fast FLCs-based MPI systems able to perform full-field imaging acquisitions in the spectral range between 450 and 700nm with error less than 1% on all the elements of measured Mueller matrices. This system can be accurately calibrated by using the Eigenvalue Calibration Method (ECM) also in presence of high residual instrumental depolarization.

Protein-based nanoparticles can be cleared by the hepatobiliary system efficiently. In this work, ultrasmall gadolinium oxide (Gd2O3) nanoparticles, which possess the advantage of high longitudinal relaxation rate, were coated with bovine serum albumin (BSA). After the Gd2O3/BSA nanoparticles were linked with two-dimensional photothermal MoS2 nanomaterials, the nanoparticles were also modified with hyaluronic acid (HA) through the disulfide bonds for tumor-targeting effect. As indicated by in vitro and in vivo studies, these Gd2O3/BSA@MoS2-HA nanoparticles could be rapidly degraded and excreted after reacting with glutathione (GSH) by the redox response, thus avoiding long-term toxicity. In addition, the cellular uptake study and in vivo multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), X-ray computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) triple-modal images demonstrated that Gd2O3/BSA@MoS2-HA nanoparticles exhibited a high tumor uptake effect after intravenous injection. Consequently, such clearable theranostic nanoparticles with multiple functions, which are applicable in multimodal imaging-guided cancer therapy, might show promise for applications in nanomedical science. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","American Chemical Society","Article","","Scopus"

Eighty per cent of BCCs are located on the head and neck area. Clinically ill-defined BCCs often represent histologically aggressive subtypes, and they can have subtle subclinical extensions leading to recurrence and the need for re-excisions. Objectives: The aim of this pilot study was to test the feasibility of a hyperspectral imaging system (HIS) in vivo in delineating the preoperatively lateral margins of ill-defined BCCs on the head and neck area. Methods: Ill-defined BCCs were assessed clinically with a dermatoscope, photographed and imaged with HIS. This was followed by surgical procedures where the BCCs were excised at the clinical border and the marginal strip separately. HIS, with a 12-cm                             2                              field of view and fast data processing, records a hyperspectral graph for every pixel in the imaged area, thus creating a data cube. With automated computational modelling, the spectral data are converted into localization maps showing the tumour borders. Interpretation of these maps was compared to the histologically verified tumour borders. Results: Sixteen BCCs were included. Of these cases, 10 of 16 were the aggressive subtype of BCC and 6 of 16 were nodular, superficial or a mixed type. HIS delineated the lesions more accurately in 12 of 16 of the BCCs compared to the clinical evaluation (4 of 16 wider and 8 of 16 smaller by HIS). In 2 of 16 cases, the HIS-delineated lesion was wider without histopathological confirmation. In 2 of 16 cases, HIS did not detect the histopathologically confirmed subclinical extension. Conclusions: HIS has the potential to be an easy and fast aid in the preoperative delineation of ill-defined BCCs, but further adjustment and larger studies are warranted for an optimal outcome.                          © 2018 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology","Blackwell Publishing Ltd","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Recent research has shown that machine learning algorithms can be used to convert pixel-wise reflectance measurements to tissue parameters, such as oxygenation. However, the accuracy of these algorithms can only be guaranteed if the spectra acquired during surgery match the ones seen during training. It is therefore of great interest to detect so-called out of distribution (OoD) spectra to prevent the algorithm from presenting spurious results. In this paper we present an information theory based approach to OoD detection based on the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC). Our work builds upon recent methodology related to invertible neural networks (INN). Specifically, we make use of an ensemble of INNs as we need their tractable Jacobians in order to compute the WAIC. Comprehensive experiments with in silico, and in vivo multispectral imaging data indicate that our approach is well-suited for OoD detection. Our method could thus be an important step towards reliable functional imaging in the operating room. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Springer","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This work analyzes the optical properties of visible structures in the surgical field for automatic tissue categorization. Building an HSI-based computer-aided tissue analysis system requires accurate ground truth and validation of optical soft tissue properties as these show large variability. In this paper, we introduce and validate two different hyperspectral intraoperative imaging setups and their use for the analysis of optical tissue properties. First, we present an improved multispectral filter-wheel setup integrated into a fully digital microscope. Second, we present a novel setup of two hyperspectral snapshot cameras for intraoperative usage. Both setups are operating in the spectral range of 400 nm up to 975 nm. They are calibrated and validated using the same database and calibration set. For validation, a color chart with 18 well-defined color spectra in the visual range is analyzed. Thus, the results acquired with both settings become transferable and comparable to each other as well as between different interventions. Clinical in-vivo data of two different oral and maxillofacial surgical procedures underline the potential of HSI as an intraoperative diagnostic tool and the clinical usability of both setups. Thereby, we demonstrate their feasibility for the in-vivo analysis and differentiation of different human soft tissues. © 2019 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

The SDF combines simulated optoacoustic signals from exogenously administered contrast agents with in vivo experimental signals from background tissue to generate realistic synthetic multispectral optoacoustic images. In this paper, the SDF is validated with in vivo measurements and demonstrates close agreement between SDF synthetic data and experimental data in terms of both image intensity and MDCs.

In the context of endoscopic video analysis, the accurate classification of organs in the field of view of the camera proffers a technical challenge. Herein, we propose a new approach to anatomical structure classification and image tagging that features an intrinsic measure of confidence to estimate its own performance with high reliability and which can be applied to both RGB and multispectral imaging (MI) data. Methods: Organ recognition is performed using a superpixel classification strategy based on textural and reflectance information. Classification confidence is estimated by analyzing the dispersion of class probabilities. Assessment of the proposed technology is performed through a comprehensive in vivo study with seven pigs. Results: When applied to image tagging, mean accuracy in our experiments increased from 65% (RGB) and 80% (MI) to 90% (RGB) and 96% (MI) with the confidence measure. Conclusion: Results showed that the confidence measure had a significant influence on the classification accuracy, and MI data are better suited for anatomical structure labeling than RGB data. Significance: This paper significantly enhances the state of art in automatic labeling of endoscopic videos by introducing the use of the confidence metric, and by being the first study to use MI data for in vivo laparoscopic tissue classification. The data of our experiments will be released as the first in vivo MI dataset upon publication of this paper. © 1964-2012 IEEE.","IEEE Computer Society","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Given the relationship between tissue damage and produced heat, LA needs a fine control of evolving thermal effects in order to evaluate and control procedure outcome. This study relies on biomedical optics principles for non-invasive diagnostic tools development, and presents a contactless approach based on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to monitor thermal damage during in vivo porcine LA. By collecting relative pixel-by-pixel reflectance/absorbance of a wide range spectrum (500-1000nm), HSI can track molecular structure modifications caused by the thermoablative procedure. Indeed, these modifications alter tissue light scattering and absorption. In order to investigate tissue spectrum change by increasing temperature, HSI was collected at fixed maximum temperatures (37, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110 °C) and immediately after LA (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 minutes). Tissue spectral response for two tests was analyzed also relying on the ablated area considered. Regions of Interest of different dimensions (16, 77, and 170 pixels) were placed in the images after applying a motion correction. Obtained spectra show noticeable variations once a specific temperature threshold has been reached (80-100 °C). Specifically, the measured absorbance variation for selected wavelengths (630, 760, 960nm, for methemoglobin, deoxyhemoglobin, and water respectively) confirms tissue optical behavior dependence with its thermal state. This preliminary investigation discloses the potential of HSI measurement to characterize LA damage, encouraging future studies to standardize this novel technique. © 2020 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

While this approach has many relevant clinical applications, it suffers from one core bottleneck: it cannot account for tissue dynamics because it works with “offline” data. To overcome this issue, we propose a new approach to surgical imaging that combines the power of multispectral imaging with the speed and robustness of deep learning based image analysis. Core innovation is an end-to-end deep learning architecture that integrates all preprocessing steps as well as the actual regression task in a single network. According to a quantitative in silico validation, our approach is well-suited for solving the inverse problem of relating multispectral image pixels to underlying functional tissue properties in real time. A porcine study further suggests that our method is capable of monitoring haemodynamic changes in vivo. Deep learning based multispectral imaging could thus become a valuable tool for imaging tissue dynamics. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Springer","Conference paper","","Scopus"

While Raman spectra demonstrate high chemical specificity, spontaneous Raman scattering is an inherently weak process and requires prohibitively long acquisition times. When Raman is utilized to image highly scattering cellular environments, integration times can be on the order of several minutes to hours. Recently developed compressed sensing techniques can greatly improve hyperspectral Raman acquisition times by randomly under-sampling the spatial dimensions. A digital micromirror device (DMD) is used to spatially encode the image plane. The encoded image is then propagated to a spectrometer where the spectral components are produced by shearing one spatial dimension. Several reconstruction algorithms have been developed that can then be used to return the original. Here, we will present single-shot, 2D Raman imaging of CHO cells using compressed hyperspectral Raman microscope. This system provides an order of magnitude improvement on traditional hyperspectral acquisition rates. Single-shot compressed hyperspectral Raman images can reveal biochemical changes due to short lifetime dynamic processes. These improvements will allow imaging of samples that metabolize quickly, rapidly oxidize, or are physically altered under experimental conditions. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

However, the reasons for these changes in vivo are not well described. This study examined the degree of MWCNT functionalization with regard to in vivo mouse lung distribution, particle retention, and resulting pathology. A commercially available MWCNT (source MWCNT) was functionalized (f-MWCNT) by systematically varying the degree of carboxylation on the particle’s surface. Following a pilot study using seven variants, two f-MWCNT variants were chosen and for lung pathology and particle distribution using oropharyngeal aspiration administration of MWCNT in Balb/c mice. Particle distribution in the lung was examined at 7 and 28 days post-instillation by bright-field microscopy, CytoViva hyperspectral dark-field imaging, and Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) microscopy. Examination of the lung tissue by bright-field microscopy showed some acute inflammation for all MWCNT that was highest with source MWCNT. Hyperspectral imaging and SRS were employed to assess the changes in particle deposition and retention. Highly functionalized MWCNT had a higher lung burden and were more disperse. They also appeared to be associated more with epithelial cells compared to the source and less functionalized MWCNT that were mostly interacting with alveolar macrophages (AM). These results showing a slightly reduced pathology despite the extended deposition have implications for the engineering of safer MWCNT and may establish a practical use as a targeted delivery system. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Taylor and Francis Ltd","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The hs-SFDI utilizes principles of spatial scanning of the spectrally dispersed output of a supercontinuum laser that is sinusoidally projected onto the tissue using a digital micromirror device. A scientific complementary metal- oxide-semiconductor camera is used for capturing images that are demodulated and analyzed using SFDI computational models. The hs-SFDI performance is validated using tissue-simulating phantoms over a range of μa and μ0s values. Quantitative hs-SFDI images are obtained from an ex-vivo beef sample to spatially resolve concentrations of oxy-, deoxy-, and met-hemoglobin, as well as water and fat fractions. Our results demonstrate that the hs-SFDI can quantitatively image tissue optical properties with 1000 spectral bins in the 580- to 950-nm range over a wide, scalable field of view. With an average accuracy of 6.7% and 12.3% in μa and μ0s, respectively, compared to conventional methods, hs-SFDI offers a promising approach for quantitative hyperspectral tissue optical imaging. © The Authors.

In addition, when heavy water is used as coupling medium to enable imaging of certain biological chromophores such as lipids and proteins, the SoS also differs significantly between couplant and tissue. While the assumption of uniform SoS is known to introduce visible deformations of features in single-wavelength optoacoustic images, the spectral error introduced by the assumption of uniform SoS is not fully understood. In this work, we provide an in-depth spectral analysis of multi-spectral optoacoustic imaging artifacts that result from the assumption of uniform SoS in situations where SoS changes substantially. We propose a dual-SoS model to incorporate the SoS variation between the couplant and the sample. Tissue-mimicking phantom experiments and in vivo measurements show that uniform SoS reconstruction causes spectral smearing, which dual-SoS modeling can largely eliminate. Due to this increased spectral accuracy, the method has the potential to improve clinical studies that rely on quantitative optoacoustic imaging of biomolecules like hemoglobin or lipids. © 2019 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Existing models such as organoids and patient-derived xenografts have many advantages, but they suffer from the drawback of not contextually preserving human tumour architecture. This is a particular problem for the preclinical testing of immunotherapies, as these agents require an intact tumour human-specific microenvironment for them to be effective. In this review, we explore the potential of patient-derived explants (PDEs) for fulfilling this need. PDEs involve the ex vivo culture of fragments of freshly resected human tumours that retain the histological features of original tumours. PDE methodology for anti-cancer drug testing has been in existence for many years, but the platform has not been widely adopted in translational research facilities, despite strong evidence for its clinical predictivity. By modifying PDE endpoint analysis to include the spatial profiling of key biomarkers by using multispectral imaging, we argue that PDEs offer many advantages, including the ability to correlate drug responses with tumour pathology, tumour heterogeneity and changes in the tumour microenvironment. As such, PDEs are a powerful model of choice for cancer drug and biomarker discovery programmes. © 2020, The Author(s).","Springer Nature","Review","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

In the head and neck region, a typical diagnostic procedure is an endoscopic intervention where a medical expert manually assesses tissue using RGB camera images. While healthy and tumor regions are generally easier to distinguish, differentiating benign and malignant tumors is very challenging. This requires an invasive biopsy, followed by histological evaluation for diagnosis. Also, during tumor resection, tumor margins need to be verified by histological analysis. To avoid unnecessary tissue resection, a non-invasive, image-based diagnostic tool would be very valuable. Recently, hyperspectral imaging paired with deep learning has been proposed for this task, demonstrating promising results on ex-vivo specimens. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of in-vivo tumor type classification using hyperspectral imaging and deep learning. We analyze the value of using multiple hyperspectral bands compared to conventional RGB images and we study several machine learning models’ ability to make use of the additional spectral information.

This has the potential for development of low cost, non-contact method for early detection of the disease. In this work, hyperspectral imaging system was used to obtain 24 images of proximal interphalangeal joints of 12 healthy volunteers. A large inter-subject variability was observed, but still an increase in transmittance in the spectral range of 600 nm – 950 nm could be associated to the joint in all images. The results of experiments were compared to detailed simulations of light propagation trough tissue. For the simulations, voxelized 3D models of unaffected and inflamed human joints with realistic tissue distributions were constructed from an in-vivo MRI scan of a healthy human finger. The simulated model of healthy finger successfully reproduced the experimental data, while the affected models indicated that the inflammation introduces detectable differences in the spectral and spatial features. The results were used to guide the design of a dedicated imaging system for detection of rheumatoid arthritis, that will be used in an upcoming clinical study. © 2019 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement","OSA - The Optical Society","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Once the Mueller matrix is determined for a particular anisotropic material, polar decomposition is applied to determine the singular values of optical anisotropies, such as depolarization, diattenuation, retardance and optical rotation. In this work, ex-vivo cancerous and noncancerous tissues were imaged by the MMPI technique using 3 different radiation wavelengths (460, 532 and 633 nm). The samples under study were cancerous and noncancerous tissues from colon. The results show that the optical anisotropies from biological samples are different. As we know, cancer changes the structure and concentration of biomedical substances from healthy tissue. One of the structures that is affected by cancer is collagen. This structure contributes to the diatenuation and retardance values. Therefore the values of diatenuation and retardance are different from the malignant and healthy tissues. We demonstrate that MMPI and polar decomposition are useful tools to discriminate healthy tissue and cancerous tissue from different parts of the body. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

These technologies, however, require a multi-step preclinical evaluation process, including mouse models. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the suitability of the new rMSI technology for the detection of premalignant lesions and malignant BC in a preclinical mouse model using contrast agents. METHODS: Tumours were induced by N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN), which is known to induce BC in rodent models. In total, 30 mice (C57BL/6) were fed with 0.1% BBN ad libitum in drinking water for up to 5 months. Bladders were excised at 3 (n = 6) and 5 months (n = 24) of treatment and incubated ex vivo with Hexaminolevulinat (HAL, Hexvix®), CD47-FITC, CD90.2-FITC or a combination of CD90.2-FITC/CD47-FITC and HAL. The bladders were analyzed by an endoscopic rMSI prototype system equipped with a spectral filter (Chroma), a 4 mm endoscope (Karl Storz) with 30◦ optic, a LED light source and a PC with a microcontroller board. RESULTS: 5-month treatment of mice with 0.1% BBN led to the formation of squamous carcinoma (46%, n = 11) while urothelial carcinoma was observed only in one mouse (4%, n = 1). Carcinoma in situ (CIS) was detectable in twelve out of twenty-four mice (50%, n = 12) treated for 5 month and in three out of six mice (50%, n = 3) treated for 3 months.The metabolite of HAL, protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), could be reliably and specifically detected in all of mouse bladder tumours and CIS. However, detection of the CD90.2 surface marker was less reliable, potentially due to species- or tumour-subtype specificity. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

Using the specialized multispectral analysis of the data obtained by fluorescence using excitation in broad spectral range, covering ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared spectral range, contribute considerably to the both the fundamental determination of tumour tissues' basic spectral parameters, and to increasing the accuracy and specificity in determining the type of pathology when spectral techniques are used that are applicable to the clinical practice. Excitation wavelengths applied namely were 365, 385, 405, 630, 785 nm. As excitation sources were used set of laser and light emitting diodes with output power in the frames of 20-50mW.

Simultaneous advances in image-processing techniques and artificial intelligence (AI), especially in machine learning and deep learning, have made these data-rich modalities highly attractive as a means of extracting biological information non-destructively. Surgery in particular is poised to benefit from this, as spectrally-resolved tissue optical properties can offer enhanced contrast as well as diagnostic and guidance information during interventions. This is particularly relevant for procedures where inherent contrast is low under standard white light visualisation. This review summarises recent work in surgical spectral imaging (SSI) techniques, taken from Pubmed, Google Scholar and arXiv searches spanning the period 2013–2019. New hardware, optimised for use in both open and minimally-invasive surgery (MIS), is described, and recent commercial activity is summarised. Computational approaches to extract spectral information from conventional colour images are reviewed, as tip-mounted cameras become more commonplace in MIS. Model-based and machine learning methods of data analysis are discussed in addition to simulation, phantom and clinical validation experiments. A wide variety of surgical pilot studies are reported but it is apparent that further work is needed to quantify the clinical value of MSI/HSI. The current trend toward data-driven analysis emphasises the importance of widely-available, standardised spectral imaging datasets, which will aid understanding of variability across organs and patients, and drive clinical translation. © 2020","Elsevier B.V.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Using this information and a set of complex classification algorithms, it is possible to determine which material or substance is located in each pixel. The work presented in this paper aims to exploit the characteristics of HSI to develop a demonstrator capable of delineating tumor tissue from brain tissue during neurosurgical operations. Improved delineation of tumor boundaries is expected to improve the results of surgery. The developed demonstrator is composed of two hyperspectral cameras covering a spectral range of 400-1700 nm. Furthermore, a hardware accelerator connected to a control unit is used to speed up the hyperspectral brain cancer detection algorithm to achieve processing during the time of surgery. A labeled dataset comprised of more than 300,000 spectral signatures is used as the training dataset for the supervised stage of the classification algorithm. In this preliminary study, thematic maps obtained from a validation database of seven hyperspectral images of in vivo brain tissue captured and processed during neurosurgical operations demonstrate that the system is able to discriminate between normal and tumor tissue in the brain. The results can be provided during the surgical procedure (~1 min), making it a practical system for neurosurgeons to use in the near future to improve excision and potentially improve patient outcomes. © 2018 by the authors.

For rapid translation into clinical practice, the techniques should be performed through an intravascular imaging catheter without exogenous contrast agents under the same procedures as conventional imaging. In this study, we developed a label-free, multispectral, and catheter-based imaging system to simultaneously visualize the morphological and compositional information of coronary plaques by combining fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) and OCT. Using a broadband hybrid optical rotary joint and a dual-modal imaging catheter, intravascular combined FLIm-OCT imaging was safely performed in an in vivo atherosclerotic coronary artery of atherosclerotic swine models without any imaging agent. Along with detailed coronary microstructure by OCT, the multispectral FLIm could accurately visualize fluorescence lifetime signature of key biochemical components of plaque in vivo (lipid, macrophage, and fibrous tissue) when comparing the corresponding histopathological stained-sections and ex vivo FLIm microscopy images. Especially, significant differences in fluorescence lifetime distribution were noted between lipid and macrophage (p < 0.0001), which were mostly indistinguishable with standalone OCT. Also, fluorescence lifetime distributions were significantly different according to plaque types (normal, fibrous vs. lipid-rich inflamed plaque, p < 0.0001). With these statistical differences in plaque types and components, lipid distribution characterization and inflammation level estimation were provided in a pixel-by-pixel manner for the further assessment of the high-risk atherosclerotic plaque. This highly translatable imaging strategy can offer new opportunity for clinical intracoronary detection of high-risk plaques and will be a promising next-generation multimodal OCT technique. © SPIE-OSA 2019","OSA - The Optical Society","Conference paper","","Scopus"

The peptide cRGD, conjugated with the near infrared fluorescent (NIRF) dye IRDye800CW and with a trans-cyclooctene (TCO) tag for future click chemistry (cRGD-800CW-TCO), was applied to PDAC bearing immunodeficient nude mice; 27 days after orthotopic transplantation of human AsPC-1 cells into the head of the pancreas, mice were injected with cRGD-800CW-TCO and imaged with fluorescence- and optoacoustic devices before and 2, 6 and 24 hr after injection, before they were sacrificed and dissected with a guidance of FGS imaging system. Fluorescence imaging of cRGD-800CW-TCO allowed detection of the tumor area but without information about the depth, whereas MSOT allowed high resolution 3 D identification of the tumor area, in particular of small tumor nodules. Highly sensitive delineation of tumor burden was achieved during FGS in all mice. Imaging of whole-mouse cryosections, histopathological analysis and NIRF microscopy confirmed the localization of cRGD-800CW-TCO within the tumor tissue. In principle, all imaging modalities applied here were able to detect PDAC in vivo. However, the combination of MSOT and FGS provided detailed spatial information of the signal and achieved a complete overview of the distribution and localization of cRGD-800CW-TCO within the tumor before and during surgical intervention. © 2017 UICC","Wiley-Liss Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

Moreover, combining several imaging modalities can provide multifaceted, complementary and cross-validated information. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a promising imaging modality that can reflect blood vasculature and tissue oxygenation as well as detect exogenous molecules, but one shortcoming of PAI is a lack of organic photoacoustic contrast agents capable of providing tumor contrast. Methods: In the present study, we designed an animal model of liver metastases from colon cancer and monitored metastasis development by in vivo bioluminescence and X-ray microcomputed tomography. Contrast-agent-free PAI was used to detect the respective amounts of oxy-and deoxyhemoglobin and, thus, liver tissue oxygenation. two contrast agents, Angiostamp800 and indocyanin green (ICG), respectively with and without tumor targeting specificity, were then evaluated for their dual fluorescence and photoacoustic detectability and were then used for combined PAI and fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (fDOT) at various disease development stages. Findings: Contrast-agent-free PAI reflected tumor angiogenesis and gradual hypoxia during metastasis development. Multispectral PAI enabled noninvasive real-time monitoring of ICG blood pharmacokinetics, which demonstrated tumor-related liver dysfunction. Both PAI and fluorescence ICG signals were clearly modified in metastasis-bearing livers but did not allow for differentiation between different disease stages. In contrast, there was a significant improvement achieved by using the tumor-specific marker Angiostamp800, which provided gradually increasing PAI and fDOT signals during metastasis development. Conclusion: We demonstrated for the first time the value of using Angiostamp800 as a bimodal tumor-targeting contrast agent for combined PAI and fluorescence imaging of liver metastasis progression in vivo. © The author(s).","Ivyspring International Publisher","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, CBCT is less adept to localize soft tissue targets growing in a low imaging contrast environment. Three-dimensional bioluminescence tomography (BLT) provides strong image contrast and thus offers an attractive solution. We introduced a novel and efficient BLT-guided conformal radiation therapy and demonstrated it in an orthotopic glioblastoma (GBM) model. Methods and Materials: A multispectral BLT system was integrated with SARRP for radiation therapy (RT) guidance. GBM growth curve was first established by contrast CBCT/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to derive equivalent sphere as approximated gross target volume (aGTV). For BLT, mice were subject to multispectral bioluminescence imaging, followed by SARRP CBCT imaging and optical reconstruction. The CBCT image was acquired to generate anatomic mesh for the reconstruction and RT planning. To ensure high accuracy of the BLT-reconstructed center of mass (CoM) for target localization, we optimized the optical absorption coefficients μa by minimizing the distance between the CoMs of BLT reconstruction and contrast CBCT/MRI-delineated GBM volume. The aGTV combined with the uncertainties of BLT CoM localization and target volume determination was used to generate estimated target volume (ETV). For conformal irradiation procedure, the GBM was first localized by the predetermined ETV centered at BLT-reconstructed CoM, followed by SARRP radiation. The irradiation accuracy was qualitatively confirmed by pathologic staining. Results: Deviation between CoMs of BLT reconstruction and contrast CBCT/MRI-imaged GBM is approximately 1 mm. Our derived ETV centered at BLT-reconstructed CoM covers >95% of the tumor volume. Using the second-week GBM as an example, the ETV-based BLT-guided irradiation can cover 95.4% ± 4.7% tumor volume at prescribed dose. The pathologic staining demonstrated the BLT-guided irradiated area overlapped well with the GBM location. Conclusions: The BLT-guided RT enables 3-dimensional conformal radiation for important orthotopic tumor models, which provides investigators a new preclinical research capability. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Elsevier Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Such tools have the potential to inform the assessment of wound status and healing progression and aid the development of new treatments. We employed spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) to characterize the changes in optical properties of tissue during wound healing progression in a porcine model of split-thickness skin grafts and also in a model of burn wound healing with no graft intervention. Changes in the reduced scattering coefficient measured using SFDI correlated with structural changes reported by histology of biopsies taken concurrently. SFDI was able to measure spatial inhomogeneity in the wounds and predicted heterogeneous healing. In addition, we were able to visualize differences in healing rate, depending on whether a wound was debrided and grafted, versus not debrided and left to heal without intervention apart from topical burn wound care. Changes in the concentration of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin were also quantified, giving insight into hemodynamic changes during healing. © The Authors.

The changes in protein autofluorescence and reflectance due to thermal damage are studied in ex vivo porcine tissue models. Thermal lesions were created in porcine skin (n 12) and liver (n 15) samples using an IR laser. The damaged regions were clearly visible in the hyperspectral images. Sizes of the thermally damaged regions as measured via HSI are compared to sizes of these regions as measured in white-light images and via physical measurement. Good agreement between the sizes measured in the hyperspectral images, white-light imaging, and physical measurements were found. The HSI system can differentiate between healthy and damaged tissue.

Combining the high contrast of optical imaging with the high resolution of ultrasound imaging, MSOT was utilized for non-invasive, real-time tomographic imaging of particles in mice and the results calibrated against analysis of tissue samples with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. In a longitudinal study, the pharmacokinetics (pK) and biodistribution of Cyanine-7 (Cy7) conjugated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (Cy7-SPIONs) were monitored after intravenous administration into the tail vein of healthy B6-albino mice. Concentrations of Cy7-SPIONs determined by MSOT image analysis of the liver, spleen, and kidneys showed excellent agreement with EPR data obtained on tissue samples ‒ validating MSOT's ability to quantify SPION concentrations with high spatial resolution. Both methods of analysis indicated highest accumulation of Cy7-SPIONs in the liver followed by the spleen, and negligible accumulation in the kidneys; SPION accumulation in organs with high concentrations of mononuclear phagocytic system macrophages is typical. Additionally, our study observed that particles modified with a 2 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) demonstrated significantly prolonged half-life in circulation compared to particles with 5 kDa PEG. The study demonstrates the potential of Cy7-SPIONs and MSOT for quantitative localization of magnetic nanoparticles in vivo, which can potentially be used to study their toxicity, quantify the efficacy of targeted drug delivery (e.g. within tumors), and their use as a multi-modal diagnostic agent to monitor disease progression. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Elsevier B.V.","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In this paper, we present a dual-modality system combining a multispectral analog-mean-delay (AMD) FLIm and a high-speed swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) to simultaneously visualize the cross-sectional morphology and biochemical compositional information of a biological tissue. Experiments using standard fluorescent solutions showed that the fluorescence lifetime could be measured with a precision of less than 40 psec using the multispectral AMD-FLIm without averaging. In addition, we performed ex vivo imaging on rabbit iliac normal-looking and atherosclerotic specimens to demonstrate the feasibility of the combined FLIm-OCT system for atherosclerosis imaging.

By taking advantage of optical and ultrasound imaging, PAI probes SLNs non-invasively with methylene blue (MB) in both live animals and breast cancer patients. However, these PAI systems have limitations for widespread use in clinics and commercial marketplaces because the lasers used by the PAI systems, e.g., tunable liquid dye laser systems and optical parametric oscillator (OPO) lasers, are bulky in size, not economical, and use risky flammable and toxic liquid dyes. To overcome these limitations, we are proposing a novel dual-modal photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging system based on a solid-state dye laser (SD-PAUSI), which is compact, convenient, and carries far less risk of flammability and toxicity. Using a solid-state dye handpiece that generates 650-nm wavelength, we successfully imaged the MB tube positioned deeply (~3.9 cm) in chicken breast tissue. The SLNs were also photoacoustically detected in the in vivo rats beneath a 2.2-cm-thick layer of chicken breast, which is deeper than the typical depth of SLNs in humans (1.2 ± 0.5 cm). Furthermore, we showed the multispectral capability of the PAI by switching the dye handpiece, in which the MB-dyed SLN was selectively highlighted from the surrounding vasculature. These results demonstrated the great potential of the SD-PAUSI as an easy but effective modality for SLN detection. © 2020 by the authors.

Currently, there is no intraoperative imaging device to detect kidney tumors during excision. Aim: We are evaluating molecular chemical imaging (MCI) as a technology for real-time tumor detection and margin assessment during tumor removal surgeries. Approach: In exploratory studies, we evaluate visible near infrared (Vis-NIR) MCI for differentiating tumor from adjacent tissue in ex vivo human kidney specimens, and in anaesthetized mice with breast or lung tumor xenografts. Differentiation of tumor from nontumor tissues is made possible with diffuse reflectance spectroscopic signatures and hyperspectral imaging technology. Tumor detection is achieved by score image generation to localize the tumor, followed by application of computer vision algorithms to define tumor border. Results: Performance of a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model for kidney tumor in a 22-patient study is 0.96 for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. A PLS-DA model for in vivo breast and lung tumor xenografts performs with 100% sensitivity, 83% specificity, and 89% accuracy. Conclusion: Detection of cancer in surgically resected human kidney tissues is demonstrated ex vivo with Vis-NIR MCI, and in vivo on mice with breast or lung xenografts. © 2020 The Authors.","SPIE","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a relatively new medical imaging procedure which has proven to be promising in tissue identification as well as in the analysis of tissue oxygenation and water content. Until now, no data exist on the in vivo HSI analysis of gastrointestinal anastomoses. Methods: Intraoperative images were obtained using the TIVITA™ tissue system HSI camera from Diaspective Vision GmbH (Pepelow, Germany). In 47 patients who underwent gastrointestinal surgery with esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, small bowel or colorectal anastomoses, 97 assessable recordings were generated. Parameters obtained at the sites of the anastomoses included tissue oxygenation (StO2), the tissue hemoglobin index (THI), near-infrared (NIR) perfusion index, and tissue water index (TWI). Results: Obtaining and analyzing the intraoperative images with this non-invasive imaging system proved practicable and delivered good results on a consistent basis. A NIR gradient along and across the anastomosis was observed and, furthermore, analysis of the tissue water and oxygenation content showed specific changes at the site of anastomosis. Conclusion: The HSI method provides a non-contact, non-invasive, intraoperative imaging procedure without the use of a contrast medium, which enables a real-time analysis of physiological anastomotic parameters, which may contribute to determine the ”ideal“ anastomotic region. In light of this, the establishment of this methodology in the field of visceral surgery, enabling the generation of normal or cut off values for different gastrointestinal anastomotic types, is an obvious necessity. © 2018, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.","Springer Verlag","Article","","Scopus"

For these operations, it is of utmost importance to remove the whole tumor, since tumor-positive resection margins may result in recurrent disease and impaired overall survival. Current optical imaging techniques using endogenous contrast - e.g. diffuse reflectance spectroscopy or optical coherence tomography - for detection of breast cancers are limited to point measurements or long acquisition times. Broadband hyperspectral cameras, which provide a complete spectral fingerprint of the object at pixel level, are needed for two-dimensional imaging of the operative region. An ex vivo study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of hyperspectral imaging for breast cancer detection. Fresh (<3 hours after surgery) resected breast cancer slices were imaged with a snapshot hyperspectral camera, which has 41 spectral bands, equally distributed in the visible and near-infrared (VIS-NIR) range (450 - 950 nm). Supervised analysis was performed by using the pathology annotations and unsupervised analysis was performed by using the hierarchical stochastic neighbour embedding (h-SNE) algorithm. So far, nine resected specimens, of which six invasive carcinomas and two (partially) mucinous carcinomas, were imaged. Spectral differences were found between the non-tumor, malign and benign regions on the resected specimens. Furthermore, automatic feature classification using h-SNE was possible in selected cases. Hyperspectral imaging showed great potential for discrimination of benign and malign breast tissue by using specific wavelengths bands in an ex vivo setting. Further analysis will be performed to determine whether it is possible to select tumor-specific wavelengths. © 2019 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Noninvasive in vivo molecular imaging with multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) uses pulsed laser light to induce acoustic pressure waves, enabling the visualization of endogenous chromophores. Here we describe an application of MSOT, in which illumination in the near- and extended near-infrared ranges from 680–1,100 nm enables the visualization and quantification of collagen content. We first demonstrated the feasibility of this approach to noninvasive quantification of tissue fibrosis in longitudinal studies in a large-animal Duchenne muscular dystrophy model in pigs, and then applied this approach to pediatric patients. MSOT-derived collagen content measurements in skeletal muscle were highly correlated to the functional status of the patients and provided additional information on molecular features as compared to magnetic resonance imaging. This study highlights the potential of MSOT imaging as a noninvasive, age-independent biomarker for the implementation and monitoring of newly developed therapies in muscular diseases. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","Nature Research","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In addition, the chemical shift differences of selected 19F probes make dual-probe imaging possible. To improve 19F MRI sensitivity for dual-probe imaging, optimal fluorine probes are needed. Purpose: To develop multispectral 19F MRI to image immune cell activity in vivo using 19F nanoparticles of two distinct fluorocarbons. Materials and Methods: Both 19F nanoparticles formulated with two fluorocarbons with distinct resonance frequencies and a high fluorine payload were characterized in terms of size, stability, MR profile, and relaxation times at 7 T. 19F MRI sensitivity was tested on labeling cells both in vitro and in vivo in C57BL/6 mice after conditional ablation of myeloid cells through the inhibition of colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1Ri) to monitor the change of immune cells phagocytosis. Fluorine MRI data were acquired at the resonance frequency of each fluorocarbon by using a three-dimensional fast spin-echo sequence. Fluorescent dyes were also inserted into 19F nanoparticles to allow flow-cytometric and confocal microscopy analysis of labeled cells. Fluorine signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) was compared by using two-way repeated measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc correction. Results: Fluorine MRI demonstrated high sensitivity and high specificity in the imaging of mononuclear cells both in vitro and in vivo. In combination with proton MRI, a map of 19F nuclei from each fluorocarbon was obtained without overlaps or artifacts. In vitro cell viability was unchanged, and 8000 cells with a high SNR (.8) were detected. In vivo high fluorine signal was observed in the bone marrow (SNR . 15) immediately after CSF1Ri treatment interruption, which correlated with high uptake by neutrophils and monocytes at flow cytometry. Conclusion: By assessing in vivo MRI of mononuclear cell phagocytic ability with 19F nanoparticles, MRI with dual 19F probes can effectively track immune cell activity in combination with current MRI protocols. © RSNA, 2019.","Radiological Society of North America Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

MoS2, widely used in electronic devices, electrocatalysis, sensor and energy-storage, has been studied as photothermal agents over the years. However, the efficacy of rod-shape MoS2 based photothermal agents for photothermal therapy has not been studied before. Here, a near-infrared (NIR) light-absorbing MoS2 nanosheets coated mesoporous silica nanorods with human serum albumin (HSA) modifying and Ce6 loading (MSNR@MoS2-HSA/Ce6) were constructed for combined photothermal and photodynamic therapy. Methods: The near-infrared (NIR) light was used to trigger the synergistic anti-tumor therapy. In addition, breast cancer cell line was applied to evaluate the in vitro anti-tumor activity. The multi-modal imaging capacity and tumor-killing efficiency of the designed nanocomposites in vivo was also demonstrated with the 4T1 tumor-bearing mouse model. Results: These nanocomposites could not only perform NIR light triggered photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), but also achieve in vivo fluorescence (FL) /multispectral optical tomography (MSOT)/X-ray computed tomography (CT) triple-model bioimaging. What's more, the rod-shape nanoplatform could be endowed with better anti-tumor ability based on the EPR effect and HSA-mediated active tumor targeting. At the same time, the hyperthermia generated by MoS2 could synergistically improve the PDT effect with the acceleration of the blood flow, leading to the increase of the oxygen level in tumor tissue.

There is a high rate of underdiagnosis because BCC is frequently confused with certain common benign lesions and is often indistinguishable from the surrounding healthy tissue. In the present study, a multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) dermoscopy system, designed for imaging and analyzing the autofluorescence emission of skin tissue, was used to image thirty-eight patients with diagnosed nodular BCC (nBCC) lesions, using clinically acceptable levels of excitation light exposure. With this system, skin autofluorescence was imaged simultaneously using three emission bands: 390 ± 20 nm, 452 ± 22 nm, and >496 nm, preferentially targeting collagen, NADH, and FAD autofluorescence, respectively. Statistical classifiers based on FLIm features developed to discriminate BCC from healthy tissue showed promising performance (ROC area-under-the-curve of 0.82). This study demonstrates the feasibility of clinically performing multispectral endogenous FLIm dermoscopy providing baseline results indicating the potential of this technology as an image-guided tool to improve the delineation of nBCC during surgical lesion resection. © 2020","Elsevier B.V.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Epilepsy surgery may be considered in patients who are resistant to drug treatment, and several tests are used during pre-operative planning to locate the epileptic focus to be resected (MRI, PET, SPECT, EEG, MEG). In some cases, intracranial EEG monitoring or intraoperative electrocorticography is required to confirm and better delineate the area to be resected. Despite available tests, epilepsy surgery outcome remains modest. We present a multimodal imaging platform connected to a neurosurgical microscope allowing intraoperative detection of intrinsic optical brain biomarkers for surgical guidance during epilepsy surgery. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) allows detection of the hemodynamic response associated with epileptic activity, spatial frequency domain imaging (SFDI) is used for optical properties reconstruction (absorption and reduced scattering), and auto-fluorescence imaging (AFI) allows metabolic markers identification. Validation of SFDI and AFI systems was performed on optical phantoms. Acquisitions on ex vivo tissue samples demonstrate the capabilities of the system to produce fluorescence intensity maps, calibrated with optical properties obtained from SFDI to account for tissue attenuation.

Damaging these critical structures can have severe surgical complications. To overcome this challenge, we are developing a fast-tuning, multispectral photoacoustic approach to guiding neurological procedures. An ex vivo porcine sciatic nerve and caprine carotid artery perfused with whole human blood were suspended in a water bath. A spectroscopic analysis with wavelengths 690 nm to 1260 nm was performed on each specimen with a constant optical energy of 1.5 mJ/pulse and 11 mJ/pulse for a 1 mm diameter optical fiber and a 5 mmm diameter fiber bundle, respectively. The contrast and signal-to-noise ratio of each target was calculated from photoacoustic images, with wavelength-dependent contrast values and signal-to-noise ratios that ranged from 0.41 to 21.8 dB and 10.12 to 25.6 dB, respectively. In particular, the blood vessel contrast (18.2 dB) was greater than the nerve contrast (0.61 dB) when excited with 750 nm light. However, the nerve contrast (10.7 dB) was greater than the blood vessel contrast (6.6 dB) when excited with 1230 nm light. These results indicate that simultaneous visualization of major vessels and nerves requires an imaging system that exploits the unique optical absorption peaks of both hemoglobin and lipids by fast-tuning between 750 nm and 1230 nm excitation wavelengths. © 2019 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

This can be done by targeting the NIR spectral signatures of oxygenated (HbO2) and deoxygenated (HHb) hemoglobin for hemodynamics as well as the oxidative state of cytochrome-c-oxidase (oxCCO) for measuring tissue metabolism. Aim: The aim of this work is to investigate the performances of HSI for this specific application as well as to assess key factors for the future design and operation of a benchtop system. Approach: The MC framework, based on Mesh-based Monte Carlo (MMC), reproduces a section of the exposed cortex of a mouse from an in vivo image and replicates hyperspectral illumination and detection at multiple NIR wavelengths (up to 121). Results: The results demonstrate: (1) the fitness of the MC framework to correctly simulate hyperspectral data acquisition; (2) the capability of HSI to reconstruct spatial changes in the concentrations of HbO2, HHb, and oxCCO during a simulated hypoxic condition; (3) that eight optimally selected wavelengths between 780 and 900 nm provide minimal differences in the accuracy of the hyperspectral results, compared to the ""gold standard"" of 121 wavelengths; and (4) the possibility to mitigate partial pathlength effects in the reconstructed data and to enhance quantification of the hemodynamic and metabolic responses. Conclusions: The MC framework is proved to be a flexible and useful tool for simulating HSI also for different applications and targets. © The Authors.

Such integration would provide complementary multiscale data to bridge the gap between molecular and anatomical phenotypes, potentially revealing new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying anatomical pathologies presented on MRI. Automatic coregistration between 3D MSI/MRI is a computationally challenging process due to dimensional complexity, MSI data sparsity, lack of direct spatial-correspondences, and nonlinear tissue deformation. Here, we present a new computational approach based on stochastic neighbor embedding to nonlinearly align 3D MSI to MRI data, identify and reconstruct biologically relevant molecular patterns in 3D, and fuse the MSI datacube to the MRI space. We demonstrate our method using multimodal high-spectral resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) 9.4 T MSI and 7 T in vivo MRI data, acquired from a patient-derived, xenograft mouse brain model of glioblastoma following administration of the EGFR inhibitor drug of Erlotinib. Results show the distribution of some identified molecular ions of the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib, a phosphatidylcholine lipid, and cholesterol, which were reconstructed in 3D and mapped to the MRI space. The registration quality was evaluated on two normal mouse brains using the Dice coefficient for the regions of brainstem, hippocampus, and cortex.

Short wavelength infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral imaging is currently becoming an important supplement to spectroscopy in optical diagnostics due to the flexibility and adaptability of the technique. However, due to the complexity of hyperspectral data, the analysis requires a well planned approach. In this paper a simple but effective approach combining dimension reduction and unsupervised classification is suggested. Examples of in vivo hyperspectral data in the SWIR spectral range (950-2500 nm) from human skin bruises and porcine skin burns are presented as examples. Data are processed using the minimum noise fraction transform (MNF), and K-means clustering. K-means clustering was found to perform significantly better if applied to MNF transformed data. The classification results agree well with biopsies, spectral data and visual inspection of injuries. It is thus shown that unsupervised clustering can be a preferable technique in cases where it is challenging to use or interpret results from physics based models, or where the ground truth is lacking or not well defined. The presented results confirm that SWIR hyperspectral imaging indeed is a useful tool for optical characterization of tissue. © 2019 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

The AuNPs were prepared inside polymeric NPs by means of ultraviolet irradiation of a gold salt in the presence of Irgacure I-2959 photoinitiator. We monitored the kinetic growth and nucleation of AuNPs (in vitro and ex vivo) over time using spectral analysis. Moreover, we investigated the cytotoxicity, localized plasmonic surface resonance (LSPR), and cellular imaging capabilities of the Au-polyester nanoparticles. The resulting Au-polyester NPs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to probe their chemical structure, size, zeta potential (ζ), and morphology, respectively. Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed that the NP formulation is stable over time and exhibits negligible toxicity against 3T3 fibroblast and U-87 MG glioblastoma cells. The results also demonstrated that the Au-polyester NPs exhibit excellent cellular imaging properties. This one-step strategy goes beyond current syntheses of gold-polyester nanoparticles because it can be used to synthesize the imaging agent in situ (i.e., in living cells) in lieu of conventional ex situ approaches. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020","Royal Society of Chemistry","Article","","Scopus"

All dispersions were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Batch dispersions of porous silica were rather unstable due to agglomeration. Animals were sacrificed one day after the last administration or after a three-week recovery period. No relevant toxicological effects were induced by any of the silica materials tested, as evaluated by body weight, gross pathology, relative organ weights (liver, spleen, kidneys), hematology, blood biochemistry, genotoxicity (Comet assay in jejunum cells and micronucleus test in peripheral blood erythrocytes), liver and small intestine histopathology, and intestinal inflammation. The presence of silica particles in the intestine was evaluated by a hyperspectral imaging microscopy system (CytoViva) using histological samples of jejunum tissue.

Accurately detecting and imaging tumor hypoxia with high spatial resolution would be conducive to formulating optimized treatment plan and thus achieving better patient outcome. Methods: Tumor hypoxia can cleave the azo linker and release a NIR fluorophore (NR-NH2) and release the active drug as well. NR-NH2 shows a strong absorption band at around 680 nm and a strong fluorescence band at 710 nm, allowing for both multispectral optoacoustic tomography imaging (MSOT) and fluorescent imaging of tumor hypoxia in a tumor-bearing mouse model. Results: Liposome encapsulated with the activatable chromophore (NR-azo) for detecting/imaging tumor hypoxia and for tumor inhibition was demonstrated. For this chromophore, a xanthene-based NIR fluorophore acts as the optoacoustic and fluorescent reporter, an azo linker serves as the hypoxia-responsive moiety and a nitrogen mustard as the therapeutic drug. NR-azo shows an absorption at around 575 nm but exhibits negligible fluorescence due to the existence of the strong electron-withdrawing azo linker.

For the challenging task of monitoring renal hemodynamics and oxygenation in rats, we designed a continuous wave (cw) multispectral near-infrared spectroscopy setup. A fiber probe with a source fiber and eight detection fibers is placed on the ventral surface of the exposed rat kidney in vivo, and an additional source fiber is positioned on the dorsal surface. Nine wavelengths from 658 nm to 1060 nm are used to have sufficient redundancy for reliable quantification of hemoglobin concentration, oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, and tissue water content. To investigate both, the surface layer and deeper tissues, the setup alternates between reflection and transmission at a rate of 10 Hz. Our system relies on spatially resolved reflection and transmission, and multispectral analysis to differentiate absorption from scattering. Monte-Carlo Simulations for a layered tissue structure are used as a model for quantitative characterization of the renal cortex and medulla. Renal parameters are monitored during baseline conditions and during dedicated pathophysiologically relevant interventions including arterial occlusion and changes of inspiratory gas mixture. Together with invasive probes, which monitor arterial blood pressure, renal perfusion and tissue oxygenation, a detailed picture of renal hemodynamics and oxygenation in several pathophysiological conditions is acquired. This detailed information can serve as a quantitative reference to other methods such as MRI. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) measures the optical reflectance spectrum of the tissue and uses this information to quantify its composition, including StO                              2                             . However, real-time monitoring is difficult due to capture rate and data processing time. Methods: An endoscopic system based on a multi-fibre probe was previously developed to sparsely capture HSI data (sHSI). These were combined with RGB images, via a deep neural network, to generate high-resolution hypercubes and calculate StO                              2                             . To improve accuracy and processing speed, we propose a dual-input conditional generative adversarial network, Dual2StO2, to directly estimate StO                              2                              by fusing features from both RGB and sHSI. Results: Validation experiments were carried out on in vivo porcine bowel data, where the ground truth StO                              2                              was generated from the HSI camera. Performance was also compared to our previous super-spectral-resolution network, SSRNet in terms of mean StO                              2                              prediction accuracy and structural similarity metrics. Dual2StO2 was also tested using simulated probe data with varying fibre number. Conclusions: StO                              2                              estimation by Dual2StO2 is visually closer to ground truth in general structure and achieves higher prediction accuracy and faster processing speed than SSRNet. Simulations showed that results improved when a greater number of fibres are used in the probe. Future work will include refinement of the network architecture, hardware optimization based on simulation results, and evaluation of the technique in clinical applications beyond StO                              2                              estimation.                          © 2019, The Author(s).","Springer Verlag","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

One of the main obstacles that researchers find when developing hyperspectral algorithms for medical applications is the lack of specific, publicly available, and hyperspectral medical data. The work described in this paper was developed within the framework of the European project HELICoiD (HypErspectraL Imaging Cancer Detection), which had as a main goal the application of hyperspectral imaging to the delineation of brain tumors in real-time during neurosurgical operations. In this paper, the methodology followed to generate the first hyperspectral database of in-vivo human brain tissues is presented. Data was acquired employing a customized hyperspectral acquisition system capable of capturing information in the Visual and Near InfraRed (VNIR) range from 400 to 1000 nm. Repeatability was assessed for the cases where two images of the same scene were captured consecutively. The analysis reveals that the system works more efficiently in the spectral range between 450 and 900 nm. A total of 36 hyperspectral images from 22 different patients were obtained. From these data, more than 300 000 spectral signatures were labeled employing a semi-automatic methodology based on the spectral angle mapper algorithm. Four different classes were defined: normal tissue, tumor tissue, blood vessel, and background elements. All the hyperspectral data has been made available in a public repository. © 2013 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Systemic inflammation is considered to be a key driver of cancer cachexia; however, clinical studies with anti-inflammatory drugs failed to show distinct cachexia-inhibiting effects. To address this contradiction, we investigated the functional importance of innate immune cells for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-associated cachexia. Methods: A transgenic HCC mouse model was intercrossed with mice harbouring a defect in myeloid cell-mediated inflammation. Body composition of mice was analysed via nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and microcomputed tomography. Quantitative PCR was used to determine adipose tissue browning and polarization of adipose tissue macrophages. The activation state of distinct areas of the hypothalamus was analysed via immunofluorescence. Multispectral immunofluorescence imaging and immunoblot were applied to characterize sympathetic neurons and macrophages in visceral adipose tissue. Quantification of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mouse serum was performed with a multiplex immunoassay. Visceral adipose tissue of HCC patients was quantified via the L3 index of computed tomography scans obtained during routine clinical care. Results: We identified robust cachexia in the HCC mouse model as evidenced by a marked loss of visceral fat and lean mass. Computed tomography-based analyses demonstrated that a subgroup of human HCC patients displays reduced visceral fat mass, complementing the murine data. While the myeloid cell-mediated inflammation defect resulted in reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the serum of HCC-bearing mice, this unexpectedly did not translate into diminished but rather enhanced cachexia-associated fat loss. Defective myeloid cell-mediated inflammation was associated with decreased macrophage abundance in visceral adipose tissue, suggesting a role for local macrophages in the regulation of cancer-induced fat loss. Conclusions: Myeloid cell-mediated inflammation displays a rather unexpected beneficial function in a murine HCC model. These results demonstrate that immune cells are capable of protecting the host against cancer-induced tissue wasting, adding a further layer of complexity to the pathogenesis of cachexia and providing a potential explanation for the contradictory results of clinical studies with anti-inflammatory drugs. © 2019 The Authors Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Society on Sarcopenia, Cachexia and Wasting Disorders","Wiley Blackwell","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

There are several techniques employed during surgical procedures to guide neurosurgeons in the tumor resection. However, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a promising non-invasive and non-ionizing imaging technique that could improve and complement the currently used methods. The HypErspectraL Imaging Cancer Detection (HELICoiD) European project has addressed the development of a methodology for tumor tissue detection and delineation exploiting HSI techniques. In this approach, the K-means algorithm emerged in the delimitation of tumor borders, which is of crucial importance. The main drawback is the computational complexity of this algorithm. This paper describes the development of the K-means clustering algorithm on different parallel architectures, in order to provide real-time processing during surgical procedures. This algorithm will generate an unsupervised segmentation map that, combined with a supervised classification map, will offer guidance to the neurosurgeon during the tumor resection task. We present parallel K-means clustering based on OpenMP, CUDA and OpenCL paradigms. These algorithms have been validated through an in-vivo hyperspectral human brain image database. Experimental results show that the CUDA version can achieve a speed-up of ~150× with respect to a sequential processing. The remarkable result obtained in this paper makes possible the development of a real-time classification system. © 2018 by the authors.

In this work, a dual-modality endoscopic system has been proposed to enable tissue surface shape reconstruction and hyperspectral imaging (HSI). This system centers around a probe comprised of an incoherent fiber bundle, whose fiber arrangement is different at the two ends, and miniature imaging optics. For 3D reconstruction with structured light (SL), a light pattern formed of randomly distributed spots with different colors is projected onto the tissue surface, creating artificial texture. Pattern decoding with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and a customized feature descriptor enables real-time 3D surface reconstruction at approximately 12 frames per second (FPS). In HSI mode, spatially sparse hyperspectral signals from the tissue surface can be captured with a slit hyperspectral imager in a single snapshot. A CNN based super-resolution model, namely “super-spectral-resolution” network (SSRNet), has also been developed to estimate pixel-level dense hypercubes from the endoscope cameras standard RGB images and the sparse hyperspectral signals, at approximately 2 FPS. The probe, with a 2.1 mm diameter, enables the system to be used with endoscope working channels. Furthermore, since data acquisition in both modes can be accomplished in one snapshot, operation of this system in clinical applications is minimally affected by tissue surface movement and deformation. The whole apparatus has been validated on phantoms and tissue (ex vivo and in vivo), while initial measurements on patients during laryngeal surgery show its potential in real-world clinical applications. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Elsevier B.V.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Properties such as nanotube type (single-walled vs. multi-walled), purity, length, aggregation state, and functionalization, as well as route of administration, greatly affect both the biocompatibility and biodistribution of carbon nanotubes. These differences suggest that generalizable conclusions may be elusive and that studies must be material- and application-specific. Here, we assess the short- and long-term biodistribution and biocompatibility of a single-chirality DNA-encapsulated single-walled carbon nanotube complex upon intravenous administration that was previously shown to function as an in-vivo reporter of endolysosomal lipid accumulation. Regarding biodistribution and fate, we found bulk specificity to the liver and >90% signal attenuation by 14 days in mice. Using near-infrared hyperspectral microscopy to measure single nanotubes, we found low-level, long-term persistence in organs such as the heart, liver, lung, kidney, and spleen. Measurements of histology, animal weight, complete blood count; biomarkers of organ function all suggest short- and long-term biocompatibility. This work suggests that carbon nanotubes can be used as preclinical research tools in-vivo without affecting acute or long-term health. © 2020 Galassi et al.

In the proposed approach, Monte Carlo simulation-based empirical formulas are introduced to extract the scattering power b representing the wavelength dependence of light scattering spectrum of skin tissue, as well as the total hemoglobin concentration C th in dermal vasculatures. The use of isosbestic wavelengths of hemoglobin enables the values of C th and b to be estimated independently of the oxygenation of hemoglobin. Experiments using in vivo mice two-stage chemical carcinogenesis model are performed to confirm the feasibility of the proposed method for evaluating the changes in cutaneous vasculatures and tissue morphology during tumor initiation, promotion, and progression processes. The experimental results reveal that the changes in scattering power b of back skin are significantly reduced and followed by the increase in total hemoglobin concentration C th in the carcinogenesis mice group, which indicates morphological changes in skin tissue such as edema and cell swelling caused by tumor promotion and successive angiogenesis along with tumor progression.

The technologies discussed in this review include confocal laser endomicroscopy, optical coherence tomography, multiphoton microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and hyperspectral imaging. These are in different stages of development and clinical readiness, but all show the potential to produce reliable in vivo discrimination of different tissue types. A structured literature search of the imaging techniques for colorectal polyps has been conducted. The significant developments in endoscopic imaging were identified for each modality, and the status of current development was discussed. Of the advanced imaging techniques discussed, confocal laser endomicroscopy is in clinical use and, under optimal conditions with an experienced operator, can provide accurate histological assessment of tissue. The remaining techniques show potential for incorporation into endoscopic equipment and practice, although further component development is needed, followed by robust prospective validation of accuracy. Optical coherence tomography illustrates tissue ""texture"" well and gives good assessment of mucosal thickness and layers. Multiphoton microscopy produces high-resolution images at a subcellular resolution. Raman spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging are less developed endoscopically but provide a tissue ""fingerprint"" which can distinguish between tissue types.

Currently, histological diagnostics use mainly stainings with standard dyes (eg, hematoxylin + eosin) to identify tumors. This method is not applicable in vivo and provides low amounts of chemical information. Biomolecules absorb near infrared light (NIR, 800-1700 nm) at different wavelengths, which could be used to fingerprint tissue. Here, we built a NIR multispectral absorption imaging setup to study skin tissue samples. NIR light (900-1500 nm) was used for homogenous wide-field transmission illumination and detected by a cooled InGaAs camera. In this setup, images I(x, y, λ) from dermatological samples (melanoma, nodular basal-cell carcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma) were acquired to distinguish healthy from diseased tissue regions. In summary, we show the potential of multispectral NIR imaging for cancer diagnostics. © 2019 The Authors. Journal of Biophotonics published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We developed a method to use hyperspectral imaging (HSI), a noncontact optical imaging modality, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform an optical biopsy of ex-vivo, surgical gross-tissue specimens, collected from 21 patients undergoing surgical cancer resection. Using a cross-validation paradigm with data from different patients, the CNN can distinguish SCCa from normal aerodigestive tract tissues with an area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 0.82. Additionally, normal tissue from the upper aerodigestive tract can be subclassified into squamous epithelium, muscle, and gland with an average AUC of 0.94. After separately training on thyroid tissue, the CNN can differentiate between thyroid carcinoma and normal thyroid with an AUC of 0.95, 92% accuracy, 92% sensitivity, and 92% specificity. Moreover, the CNN can discriminate medullary thyroid carcinoma from benign multinodular goiter (MNG) with an AUC of 0.93. Classical-type papillary thyroid carcinoma is differentiated from MNG with an AUC of 0.91. Our preliminary results demonstrate that an HSI-based optical biopsy method using CNNs can provide multicategory diagnostic information for normal and cancerous head-and-neck tissue, and more patient data are needed to fully investigate the potential and reliability of the proposed technique. © The Authors.

We are developing bioengineered organoids that will differentiate when implanted in vivo to partially restore organ function. These complex organoids, derived from embryonic salivary gland cells, include both primary mesenchyme and epithelial progenitor cells. Noninvasive quality monitoring of tissue-engineered constructs is required before implantation of bioengineered constructs in vivo. Raman spectroscopy offers fast, simple, and, most importantly, non-invasive quantitative cell and tissue analysis that does not require elaborate sample preparation. We demonstrate the application of Raman micro-spectroscopy technique to in vitro monitoring of cell types within 3D cell clusters, with the ultimate goal of applying this technology in situ to monitor adult cell-derived organoids that are implanted in vivo. We have collected Raman spectra of epithelial and mesenchymal progenitor cells in vitro, and have shown that we are able to identify different Raman signatures corresponding to each cell type. In particular, we have observed Raman spectral differences which correspond to the C-C and C-N stretch in proteins, as well as in the Amide I and III envelopes. The embryonic mesenchyme cells are similar to mesenchymal stem cells, MSCs, which can differentiate into bone, cartilage, and other cell types. In addition to salivary gland tissue engineering applications, mesenchymal cells offer a great potential in repairing bone, cartilage, and damaged heart cells, and to treat inflammation and immune system diseases. In future studies, our Raman spectroscopy methods can be broadly applied to monitoring of organoids for application in many diseases. © 2019 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

In the current ex vivo study, we evaluated the feasibility of hyperspectral diffuse reflectance imaging (HSI) for distinguishing tumor from the healthy tongue tissue. Study Design/Materials and Methods: Fresh surgical specimens (n = 14) of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue were scanned with two hyperspectral cameras that cover the visible and near-infrared spectrum (400–1,700 nm). Each pixel of the hyperspectral image represents a measure of the diffuse optical reflectance. A neural network was used for tissue-type prediction of the hyperspectral images of the visual and near-infrared data sets separately as well as both data sets combined. Results: HSI was able to distinguish tumor from muscle with a good accuracy. The diagnostic performance of both wavelength ranges (sensitivity/specificity of visual and near-infrared were 84%/80% and 77%/77%, respectively) appears to be comparable and there is no additional benefit of combining the two wavelength ranges (sensitivity and specificity were 83%/76%). Conclusions: HSI has a strong potential for intra-operative assessment of tumor resection margins of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. This may optimize surgery, as the entire resection surface can be scanned in a single run and the results can be readily available. Lasers Surg.

Paired-agent imaging (PAI) using matched targeted and untargeted agents has been established as a dynamic method for quantifying the extracellular domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in vivo in a variety of tumor lines. Here we extend the PAI model to simultaneously quantify the extracellular and intracellular regions of EGFR using novel cell membrane permeable fluorescent small molecules, TRITC-erlotinib (targeted) and BODIPY-N-erlotinib (non-binding control isoform) synthesized in house. An EGFR overexpressing squamous cell carcinoma cell xenograft tumor, A431, was implanted on the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of the embryonated chicken egg. In total six fluorescent molecules were administered and monitored over 1 h using multi-spectral imaging. EGFR concentrations were determined using both extracellular and intracellular PAI methods. The fluorescent molecules used for extracellular PAI were ABY-029, an anti- EGFR Affibody molecule conjugated to IRDye 800CW, and a Control Imaging Agent Affibody molecule conjugated to IRDye 680RD. The intracellular PAI (iPAI) fluorescent molecules were cell membrane penetrating TRITC-erlotinib, BODIPY-N-erlotinb, and BODIPY TR carboxylate, as well as cell membrane impermeant control agent, Alexa Fluor 647 carboxylate. Results from simultaneous imaging of both the extracellular and intracellular binding domains of EGFR indicate that concentrations of intracellular EGFR are higher than extracellular. This is anticipated as EGFR exists in two distinct populations in cells, cell membrane bound and internalized, activated protein. iPAI is a promising new method for quantifying intracellular proteins in a rapid tumor model on the chicken CAM. © 2019 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Ten RPE flatmounts from eyes with AMD and 10 from eyes without AMD underwent 40× hyperspectral AF microscopic imaging. The number of excitation wavelengths tested was initially two (436 nm and 480 nm), then increased to three (436 nm, 480 nm, and 505 nm). Emission spectra were collected at 10 nm intervals from 420 nm to 720 nm. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithms decomposed the hyperspectral images into individual emission spectra and their spatial abundances. These include three distinguishable spectra for RPE fluorophores (S1, S2, and S3) in both AMD and non-AMD eyes, a spectrum for drusen (SDr) only in AMD eyes, and a Bruch’s membrane spectrum that was detectable in normal eyes. Simultaneous analysis of datacubes excited atthree excitation wavelengths revealed more detailed spatial localization of the RPE spectra and SDr within drusen than exciting only at two wavelengths. Within AMD and non-AMD groups, two different NMF initialization methods were tested on each group and converged to qualitatively similar spectra. In AMD, the peaks of the SDr at ~510 nm (436 nm excitation) were particularly consistent. Between AMD and non-AMD groups, corresponding spectra in common, S1, S2, and S3, also had similar peak locations and shapes, but with some differences and further characterization warranted. © 2020, MDPI AG.

Currently, tissue types have to be continuously differentiated based on the surgeon's knowledge only. Further, automatic methods based on optical in vivo properties of human tissue do not yet exist, as these properties have not been sufficiently examined. To overcome this, we developed a hyperspectral camera setup to monitor the different optical behavior of tissue types in vivo. The aim of this work is to collect and analyze these behaviors to open up optical opportunities during surgery. Our setup uses a digital camera and several bandpass filters in front of the light source to illuminate different tissue types with 16 specific wavelength ranges. We analyzed the different intensities of eight healthy tissue types over the visible spectrum (400 to 700 nm). Using our setup and sophisticated postprocessing in order to handle motion during capturing, we are able to find tissue characteristics not visible for the human eye to differentiate tissue types in the 16-dimensional wavelength domain. Our analysis shows that this approach has the potential to support the surgeon's decisions during treatment. © The Authors.

There is a clinical need to develop non-invasive techniques that can provide reliable assistance for tumor resection in real-time during surgical procedures. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) arises as a new, noninvasive and non-ionizing technique that can assist neurosurgeons during this difficult task. In this paper, we explore the use of deep learning (DL) techniques for processing hyperspectral (HS) images of in-vivo human brain tissue. We developed a surgical aid visualization system capable of offering guidance to the operating surgeon to achieve a successful and accurate tumor resection. The employed HS database is composed of 26 in-vivo hypercubes from 16 different human patients, among which 258,810 labelled pixels were used for evaluation. The proposed DL methods achieve an overall accuracy of 95% and 85% for binary and multiclass classifications, respectively. The proposed visualization system is able to generate a classification map that is formed by the combination of the DL map and an unsupervised clustering via a majority voting algorithm. This map can be adjusted by the operating surgeon to find the suitable configuration for the current situation during the surgical procedure. © 2019 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In this study, we present the synthesis, MRI signal enhancement capabilities, in vitro as well as in vivo cytotoxicity results of gold-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4@AuNPs) as potential contrast agents. Methods: Fe3O4@AuNPs were obtained by synthesizing iron oxide nanoparticles and gradually coating them with gold. The obtained Fe3O4@AuNPs were characterized by spectroscopies, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray diffraction. The effect of the nanoparticles on the MRI signal was tested using a 7T Bruker PharmaScan system. Cytotoxicity tests were made in vitro on Fe3O4@AuNP-treated retinal pigment epithelium cells by WST-1 tests and in vivo by following histopathological changes in rats after injection of Fe3O4@AuNPs. Results: Stable Fe3O4@AuNPs were successfully prepared following a simple and fast protocol (<1h worktime) and identified using TEM. The cytotoxicity tests on cells have shown biocompatibility of Fe3O4@AuNPs at small concentrations of Fe (<1.95×10−8 mg/ cell). Whereas, at higher Fe concentrations (eg 7.5×10−8 mg/cell), cell viability decreased to 80.88±5.03%, showing a mild cytotoxic effect. MRI tests on rats showed an optimal Fe3O4 @AuNPs concentration of 6mg/100g body weight to obtain high-quality images. The histopathological studies revealed significant transient inflammatory responses in the time range from 2 hours to 14 days after injection and focal cellular alterations in several organs, with the lung being the most affected organ. These results were confirmed by hyperspectral microscopic imaging of the same, but unstained tissues. In most organs, the inflammatory responses and sublethal cellular damage appeared to be transitory, except for the kidneys, where the glomerular damage indicated progression towards glomerular sclerosis. Conclusion: The obtained stable, gold covered, iron oxide nanoparticles with reduced cytotoxicity, gave a negative T2 signal in the MRI, which makes them suitable for candidates as contrast agent in small animal MRI applications. © 2020 Iancu et al.","Dove Medical Press Ltd.","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Processed StO2 maps of wounds using a reconstructed mathematical model revealed a mean StO2 of and, respectively, in acute and chronic wounds.

Herein, polymeric nanoparticles with monomers containing alkyne, cyanide, azide, and carbon-deuterate were prepared as Raman-active nanomaterials (Raman beads) for bioimaging applications. Intense Raman signals were obtained due to the high density of alkyne, cyanide, azide, and carbon-deuterate in single nanoparticles, in absence of metal (such as Au or Ag) as Raman enhancers. We have developed a library of Raman beads for frequency multiplexing through the end-capping substitutions of monomers and demonstrated five-color SRS imaging of mixed nanoparticles with distinct Raman frequencies. In addition, with further surface functionalization of targeting moieties (such as nucleic acid aptamers and targeting peptides), targetable Raman beads were successfully used as probes for tumor targeting and Raman spectroscopic detection, including multicolor SRS imaging in living tumor cells and tissues with high specificity. Further in vivo studies indicated that Raman beads anchored with targeting moieties were successfully employed to target tumors in living mice after tail intravenous injection, and Raman spectral detection of tumor in live mice was achieved only through spontaneous Raman signal at the biological Raman-silent region without any signal enhancement due to a high density of Raman reporters in Raman beads. With further copolymerization of these monomers, Raman beads with supermultiplex barcoding could be readily achieved.                          © 2019 American Chemical Society.","American Chemical Society","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

Neuro-oncology surgery would especially benefit from detailed real-time in vivo tissue characterisation, improving the accuracy with which boundaries of safe surgical resection are delineated and thereby improving patient outcomes. Current systems are limited by challenges with processing the HSI data because of incomplete characterisation of the optical properties of tissue across the complete visible and near-infrared wavelength spectrum. In this study, we characterised the optical properties of various freshly-excised brain tumours and normal cadaveric human brain tissue using a dual-beam integrating sphere spectrophotometer and the inverse adding-doubling technique. We adapted an integrating sphere to analyse 2 mm-thick tissue samples measuring 4-7 mm in diameter and validated the experimental setup with a tissue-mimicking optical phantom. We investigated the different spectral signatures of freshly-excised tumour tissues including pituitary adenoma, meningioma and vestibular schwannoma and compared these to normal grey and white matter, pons, pituitary, dura and cranial nerve tissues across the wavelength range of 400-1800 nm. It was found that brain and tumour tissues could be differentiated by their optical properties but the freezing process did alter the tissues' relative absorption and reduced scattering coefficients. In this work, we have demonstrated a method to characterise the optical properties of small human brain and tumour specimens that may be used as a reference dataset for developing optical imaging techniques. © 2020 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Traditional clinical techniques relying on biopsy-based histological examinations and blood tests are dramatically restricted due to their invasiveness, unsatisfactory precision, non-real-time reporting and risk of complications. Although current strategies through molecular imaging enable non-invasive and spatiotemporal mapping of pathological changes in intact organisms, environment-activatable, sensitive and quantitative sensing platforms, especially for dynamic feedback of the therapeutic response, are still urgently desired in practice. Herein, we innovatively integrate deep-tissue penetrable multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) and near-infrared (NIR) optical imaging based technology by tailoring a free radical-responsive chromophore with photon-upconverting nanocrystals. During the therapeutic process, the specific reactions between the drug-stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and radical-sensitive probes result in an absorption shift, which can be captured by MSOT. Meanwhile, the radical-triggered reaction also induces multispectral upconversion luminescence (UCL) responses that exhibit the opposite trend in comparison to MSOT. Such reversed-ratiometric dual-modal imaging outcomes provide an ideal cross-referencing system that guarantees the maximum sensing specificity and sensitivity, thus enabling precise disease biology evaluation and treatment assessments in vivo.

Ischemia, one of the two broad categories of stroke, is characterized by a lack of sufficient amounts of blood in order to supply an adequate amount of oxygen and nutrients. It is important to assess the part of the brain that becomes ischemic and necrotic during neurosurgery or experiments in real time. However, there is currently no effective means to achieve this goal. New method: We proposed a method based on hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for the real-time detection of a varied range of ischemic brain tissues in vivo or ex vivo and assessed the practical utility of a model of ischemic stroke in rats. Results: The results showed that hyperspectral images processed with a ratio of spectral reflectance at 545 and 560 nm (R545/R560) could identify early brain ischemia and accurately show regions of ischemia. Comparison with existing methods: We verified the area imaged by HSI using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining methods. This technique could precisely image the ischemic part of the brain in vivo and ex vivo. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the practical utility of HSI for the real-time detection of cerebral ischemia in rats. By providing rapid assessment of brain tissue perfusion, HSI may help doctors recognize ischemic regions quickly and precisely during surgery as well as have great utility in the experimental process. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Elsevier B.V.","Article","","Scopus"

We describe development of a new nanoconstruct composed of gold nanorods (GNRs) conjugated to carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) antibody that specifically binds to CAIX, a biomarker of hypoxia, to facilitate targeting tumor hypoxic areas for focused photothermal ablation. Physicochemical characterization studies confirmed the size, shape, monodispersity, surface charge, and serum stability of the GNRs. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and cellular binding and uptake studies confirmed successful conjugation of antibody to the GNRs and specificity for CAIX. Near-infrared irradiation of CAIX-overexpressing cells treated with GNR/anti-CAIX resulted in significantly higher cell death than cells treated with control GNRs. In vivo biodistribution studies using hyperspectral imaging and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry confirmed intravenous administration results not only in greater accumulation of GNR/anti-CAIX in tumors than control GNRs but also greater penetration into hypoxic areas of tumors. Nearinfrared ablation of these tumors showed no tumor regression in the sham-treated group, regression but recurrence in the non-targeted-GNR group, and complete tumor regression in the targeted-GNR group. GNR/anti-CAIX nanoconstructs show promise as hypoxia targeting and photothermal ablation agents for cancer treatment. © Chen et al.","Impact Journals LLC","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This study investigates the performance of label-free, reflectance-based hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and autofluorescence imaging for SCC detection at the cancer margin in excised tissue specimens from 102 patients and uses fluorescent dyes for comparison. Fresh surgical specimens (n = 293) were collected during H and N SCC resections (n = 102). The tissue specimens were imaged with reflectance-based HSI and autofluorescence imaging and afterwards with two fluorescent dyes for comparison. A histopathological ground truth was made. Deep learning tools were developed to detect SCC with new patient samples (inter-patient) and machine learning for intra-patient tissue samples. Area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operator characteristic was used as the main evaluation metric. Additionally, the performance was estimated in mm increments circumferentially from the tumor-normal margin. In intra-patient experiments, HSI classified conventional SCC with an AUC of 0.82 up to 3 mm from the cancer margin, which was more accurate than proflavin dye and autofluorescence (both p < 0.05). Intra-patient autofluorescence imaging detected human papilloma virus positive (HPV+) SCC with an AUC of 0.99 at 3 mm and greater accuracy than proflavin dye (p < 0.05). The inter-patient results showed that reflectance-based HSI and autofluorescence imaging outperformed proflavin dye and standard red, green, and blue (RGB) images (p < 0.05). In new patients, HSI detected conventional SCC in the larynx, oropharynx, and nasal cavity with 0.85–0.95 AUC score, and autofluorescence imaging detected HPV+ SCC in tonsillar tissue with 0.91 AUC score. This study demonstrates that label-free, reflectance-based HSI and autofluorescence imaging methods can accurately detect the cancer margin in ex-vivo specimens within minutes. This non-ionizing optical imaging modality could aid surgeons and reduce inadequate surgical margins during SCC resections. © 2019 by the authors.

While HSI appears promising for biomedical applications, interpretation of hyperspectral images can be challenging when data is acquired in complex biological environments. Variations in surface topology or optical power distribution at the sample, encountered for example during endoscopy, can lead to errors in post-processing of the HSI data, compromising disease diagnostic capabilities. Here, we propose a background correction method to compensate for such variations, which estimates the optical properties of illumination at the target based on the normalised spectral profile of the light source and the measured HSI intensity values at a fixed wavelength where the absorption characteristics of the sample are relatively low (in this case, 800 nm). We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method by imaging blood samples, tissuemimicking phantoms, and ex vivo chicken tissue. Moreover, using synthetic HSI data composed from experimentally measured spectra, we show the proposed method would improve statistical analysis of HSI data. The proposed method could help the implementation of HSI techniques in practical clinical applications, where controlling the illumination pattern and power is difficult. © 2020 Yoon et al.

Methods: The used hyperspectral camera is able to record light spectra from 500 to 1000 nm and provides information about physiologic parameters of the recorded tissue area intraoperatively (e.g., tissue oxygenation and perfusion). We performed an open-label, single-arm, and non-randomized intervention clinical trial to compare clinical assessment and hyperspectral measurement to define the resection margin in 24 patients before and after separation of the marginal artery over 15 min; HSI was performed each minute to assess the parameters mentioned above. Results: The false color images calculated from the hyperspectral data visualized the margin of perfusion in 20 out of 24 patients precisely. In the other four patients, the perfusion difference could be displayed with additional evaluation software. In all cases, there was a deviation between the transection line planed by the surgeon and the border line visualized by HSI (median 1 mm; range − 13 to 13 mm). Tissue perfusion dropped up to 12% within the first 10 mm distal to the border line. Therefore, the resection area was corrected proximally in five cases due to HSI record. The biggest drop in perfusion took place in less than 2 min after devascularization. Conclusion: Determination of the resection margin by HSI provides the surgeon with an objective decision aid for assessment of the best possible perfusion and ideal anastomotic area in colorectal surgery. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Springer Verlag","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Surprisingly, little is known about the critical interaction between the structural composition of the dyes and the pharmacokinetics of the tracers. In this study, a dual-modality tracer design was used to systematically and quantitatively evaluate the influence of elongation of the polymethine chain in a fluorescent cyanine dye on the imaging potential of a targeted tracer. Methods: As a model system, the integrin marker α                             v                             β                             3                              was targeted using arginylglycylaspartisc acid [RGD]–based vectors functionalized with a                             111                             In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) chelate and a fluorescent dye: (Cy3-(SO                             3                             )methyl-COOH [emission wavelength (l                             em                             ), 580 nm], Cy5-(SO                             3                             )methyl-COOH [l                             em                             , 680 nm], or Cy7-(SO                             3                             ) methyl-COOH [l                             em                             , 780 nm]). Tracers were analyzed for differences in photophysical properties, serum protein binding, chemical or optical stability, and signal penetration through tissue. Receptor affinities were evaluated using saturation and competition experiments. In vivo biodistribution (SPECT imaging and percentage injected dose per gram of tissue) was assessed in tumor-bearing mice and complemented with in vivo and ex vivo fluorescence images obtained using a clinical-grade multispectral fluorescence laparoscope. Results: Two carbon-atom-step variations in the polymethine chain of the fluorescent cyanine dyes were shown to significantly influence the chemical and photophysical characteristics (e.g., stability, brightness, and tissue penetration) of the hybrid RGD tracers. DTPA-Cy5-(SO                             3                             )methyl-COOH-c[RGDyK] structurally outperformed its Cy3 and Cy7 derivatives. Radioactivity-based evaluation of in vivo tracer pharmacokinetics yielded the lowest nonspecific uptake and highest tumor-to-background ratio for DTPA-Cy5-(SO                             3                             )methyl-COOH-c[RGDyK] (13.2 ± 1.7), with the Cy3 and Cy7 analogs trailing at respective tumor-to-background ratios of 5.7 ± 0.7 and 4.7 ± 0.7. Fluorescence-based assessment of tumor visibility revealed a similar trend. Conclusion: These findings underline that variations in the polymethine chain lengths of cyanine dyes have a profound influence on the photophysical properties, stability, and in vivo targeting capabilities of fluorescent imaging tracers. In a direct comparison, the intermediate-length dye (Cy5) yielded a superior c[RGDyK] tracer, compared with the shorter (Cy3) and longer (Cy7) analogs.

Recent research has shown that live monitoring of functional tissue properties, such as tissue oxygenation and blood volume fraction, is possible using multispectral imaging in laparoscopic surgery. While the illuminant spectrum is typically kept constant in laparoscopic surgery and can thus be estimated from preoperative calibration images, a key challenge in open surgery originates from the dynamic changes of lighting conditions. Methods: The present paper addresses this challenge with a novel approach to light source calibration based on specular highlight analysis. It involves the acquisition of low-exposure time images serving as a basis for recovering the illuminant spectrum from pixels that contain a dominant specular reflectance component. Results: Comprehensive in silico and in vivo experiments with a range of different light sources demonstrate that our approach enables an accurate and robust recovery of the illuminant spectrum in the field of view of the camera, which results in reduced errors with respect to the estimation of functional tissue properties. Our approach further outperforms state-of-the-art methods proposed in the field of computer vision. Conclusion: Our results suggest that low-exposure multispectral images are well suited for light source calibration via specular highlight analysis. This work thus provides an important first step toward live functional imaging in open surgery. © 2020, The Author(s).","Springer","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Literature has, however, produced conflicting results over the last few years. As such, this study aimed to investigate the toxicological effects of nanogold (nAu) on several indicators that range from subcellular to whole-organism level. Gene regulation, changes in oxidative stress biomarkers and swimming performance were assessed in Danio rerio (zebrafish) following exposures to nAu. Adult zebrafish were exposed in vivo to nAu for 96 h and swimming performance measured post-exposure. Liver tissue was collected for DNA microarray and Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reactions (RT-PCR) analyses to determine changes in gene expression (catalase, superoxide dismutase and metallothioneins) and protein biomarker analyses (catalase, superoxide dismutase, acetylcholine esterase, malondialdehyde, cellular energy allocation and metallothionein) were performed on whole-body samples. Swimming behaviour was assessed in 1.1 L Tecniplast™ tanks for a period of six hours and videos were analysed using Noldus EthoVision software. Critical swimming speed was measured in a Loligo® swimming tunnel. The DNA microarray revealed that fish exposed to 20 mg/L differed most from the control group. At 20 mg/L there was a significant increase in gene expression for all genes analysed but this didn't translate to significant responses in protein biomarker levels except for an increase in protein carbonyl formation. The behaviour results demonstrated significant changes in distance moved, swimming speed, acceleration bouts, zone alterations and time spent within the top zone – responses that are usually observed in fish responding to toxicological stress. Furthermore, the critical swimming speed of exposed fish was decreased significantly compared to the control. Since swimming performance and social interaction among zebrafish is essential to their survival, whole-organism behaviour that suggests a toxicological response after exposure to nAu is in agreement with the genetic responses measured in this study. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Elsevier B.V.","Article","","Scopus"

Yet, today there are limited means by which the boundaries of such scars can be visualized during surgery and distinguished from the sites of acute injury caused by radiofrequency (RF) ablation. Objective: We sought to explore a hyperspectral imaging (HSI) methodology to delineate and distinguish scar tissue from tissue injury caused by RF ablation. Methods: RF ablation of the ventricular surface of live rats that underwent thoracotomy was followed by a 2-month animal recovery period. During a second surgery, new RF lesions were placed next to the scarred tissue from the previous ablation procedure. The myocardial infarction model was used as an alternative way to create scar tissue. Results: Excitation-emission matrices acquired from the sites of RF lesions, scar region, and the surrounding unablated tissue revealed multiple spectral changes. These findings justified HSI of the heart surface using illumination with 365 nm UV light while acquiring spectral images within the visible range. Autofluorescence-based HSI enabled to distinguish sites of RF lesions from scar or unablated myocardium in open-chest rats. A pilot version of a percutaneous HSI catheter was used to demonstrate the feasibility of RF lesion visualization in atrial tissue of live pigs. Conclusion: HSI based on changes in tissue autofluorescence is a highly effective tool for revealing—in vivo and with high spatial resolution—surface boundaries of myocardial scar and discriminating it from areas of acute necrosis caused by RF ablation. © 2017 The Authors","Elsevier B.V.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

However, non-invasive measurement of local tissue metabolism is limited today by a deficiency in adequate tools for in vivo observations. We designed a multi-modular platform that explored the relation between local tissue oxygen consumption, determined by label-free optoacoustic measurements of hemoglobin, and concurrent indirect calorimetry obtained during metabolic activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT). By studying mice and humans, we show how video-rate handheld multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) in the 700–970 nm spectral range enables non-invasive imaging of BAT activation, consistent with positron emission tomography findings. Moreover, we observe BAT composition differences between healthy and diabetic tissues. The study consolidates hemoglobin as a principal label-free biomarker for longitudinal non-invasive imaging of BAT morphology and bioenergetics in situ. We also resolve water and fat components in volunteers, and contrast MSOT readouts with magnetic resonance imaging data. Reber et al. employed label-free multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography to non-invasively image BAT and WAT in mice and humans and resolve BAT activation based on hemoglobin gradients.

Energy-based approaches have been investigated as potential alternative to the gold-standard techniques (e.g., Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection). Among these techniques, the laser has been studied for achieving a selective ablation of the gastric mucosa. Together with the optimization of the laser settings for avoiding tissue perforation or insufficient ablation, a tool providing quantitative information about the intraoperative tissue state can support the treatment guidance. This work aims at providing a novel non-invasive approach based on the use of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for monitoring ablative therapy in in vivo gastric mucosa. The three-dimensional datasets generated by the HSI provide spatial and spectral information of the scene, thus collecting tissue optical features during the ablation therapy in each pixel of the images. The operation of a diode laser focused on the porcine gastric mucosa was controlled in accordance with chosen temperature thresholds (i.e., 36, 60, 70, 80, 100, 110 °C), measured with a thermographic camera. HSIs of the living gastric mucosa undergoing laser procedure hold diagnostic information about the thermal outcome. Two tests have been performed, and the temperature dependence of three characteristic spectral wavelengths have been analysed: oxyhemoglobin (Hb02) in the visible range 500-600 nm, methemoglobin (metHb) around 630 nm, and deoxyhemoglobin (Hb) at 760 nm. The data have been processed in terms of absorbance at the set temperature relative to the absorbance at initial body temperature (36 °C). After 60 °C the percentage relative absorbance of metHb increased significantly in both tests (i.e., 92.3±1.9 % at 70 °C and 229.4±4.7% at 100 °C in Test2); regarding the Hb at 110 °C, Test1 reported an increase of 43.8±1.7 %, versus 127.2±3.8% in the Test2. On the other hand, HbO2 chromophore experiences an increase only for the first stages of heating later decreasing in favour of metHb and Hb formation.In both tests, similar trends for characteristic wavelengths are found, thus demonstrating the potential of the HSI measurement in laser-induced thermal damage monitoring. Although optical response show dependence on the tissue type and condition, this finding encourages future studies to standardize this promising technique. © 2020 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Conference paper","","Scopus"

For rapid translation into clinical practice, the techniques should be performed through an intravascular imaging catheter without exogenous contrast agents under the same procedures as conventional imaging. In this study, we developed a label-free, multispectral, and catheter-based imaging system to simultaneously visualize the morphological and compositional information of coronary plaques by combining fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIm) and OCT. Using a broadband hybrid optical rotary joint and a dual-modal imaging catheter, intravascular combined FLIm-OCT imaging was safely performed in an in vivo atherosclerotic coronary artery of atherosclerotic swine models without any imaging agent. Along with detailed coronary microstructure by OCT, the multispectral FLIm could accurately visualize fluorescence lifetime signature of key biochemical components of plaque in vivo (lipid, macrophage, and fibrous tissue) when comparing the corresponding histopathological stained-sections and ex vivo FLIm microscopy images. Especially, significant differences in fluorescence lifetime distribution were noted between lipid and macrophage (p < 0.0001), which were mostly indistinguishable with standalone OCT. Also, fluorescence lifetime distributions were significantly different according to plaque types (normal, fibrous vs. lipid-rich inflamed plaque, (p < 0.0001). With these statistical differences in plaque types and components, lipid distribution characterization and inflammation level estimation were provided in a pixel-by-pixel manner for the further assessment of the high-risk atherosclerotic plaque. This highly translatable imaging strategy can offer new opportunity for clinical intracoronary detection of high-risk plaques and will be a promising next-generation multimodal OCT technique.

In particular, multispectral optoacoustic tomography has emerged has an innovative PAI technology, which enables high detection specificity by resolving multiple spectral signatures through tissues and accurately decomposing the biodistribution of relevant molecules from non-specific background contributions. Key criteria for developing PAI contrast agents include strong absorbance in the near-infrared (NIR) tissue transparent region and low toxicity. In this study, we have fabricated gold nanotubes (Au NTs) with controlled length and NIR absorption for the application as in vivo MSOT contrast agents. The length control relies on the synthesis of silver nanorod template under certain growth conditions. The Au NTs were coated with a layer of biocompatible polymer, poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS), to ensure colloidal stability and low cytotoxicity.

The development of a non-contact and label-free method to provide reliable support for tumor resection in real-time during neurosurgical procedures is a current clinical need. Hyperspectral imaging is a non-contact, non-ionizing, and label-free imaging modality that can assist surgeons during this challenging task without using any contrast agent. In this work, we present a deep learning-based framework for processing hyperspectral images of in vivo human brain tissue. The proposed framework was evaluated by our human image database, which includes 26 in vivo hyperspectral cubes from 16 different patients, among which 258,810 pixels were labeled. The proposed framework is able to generate a thematic map where the parenchymal area of the brain is delineated and the location of the tumor is identified, providing guidance to the operating surgeon for a successful and precise tumor resection. The deep learning pipeline achieves an overall accuracy of 80% for multiclass classification, improving the results obtained with traditional support vector machine (SVM)-based approaches. In addition, an aid visualization system is presented, where the final thematic map can be adjusted by the operating surgeon to find the optimal classification threshold for the current situation during the surgical procedure. © 2019 by the authors.

Furthermore, methods to quantify autophagy flux, such as mitophagy transgenic reporters, in situ immunofluorescent staining and multispectral imaging flow cytometry, in mature skeletal muscle and cells are addressed.SummaryTo achieve clinical benefit, less toxic, temporary and cell-Type-specific modulation of autophagy should be pursued further. A temporary knockdown as described for the Atg5-shRNA mice could provide a first insight into possible implications of autophagy inhibition. However, it is also important to take a closer look into the methods to evaluate autophagy after harvesting the tissue.

Here, the potential of a new combined optical + optoacoustic imaging method for intraoperative brain tumor delineation is investigated. A strategy using a newly developed gold nanostar synthesis method, Raman reporter chemistry, and silication method to produce dual-modality contrast agents for combined surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) and multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging is devised. Following intravenous injection of the SERRS-MSOT-nanostars in brain tumor bearing mice, sequential MSOT imaging is performed in vivo and followed by Raman imaging. MSOT is able to accurately depict GBMs three-dimensionally with high specificity. The MSOT signal is found to correlate well with the SERRS images. Because SERRS enables uniquely sensitive high-resolution surface detection, it could represent an ideal complementary imaging modality to MSOT, which enables real-time, deep tissue imaging in 3D. This dual-modality SERRS-MSOT-nanostar contrast agent reported here is shown to enable high precision depiction of the extent of infiltrating GBMs by Raman- and MSOT imaging in a clinically relevant murine GBM model and could pave new ways for improved image-guided resection of brain tumors. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Advances in hardware and software continue to bring MSOT closer to clinical translation. Most recently, a clinical handheld MSOT system has been used to image brown fat tissue (BAT) and its metabolic activity by directly resolving the spectral signatures of hemoglobin and lipids. This opens up new possibilities for studying BAT physiology and its role in metabolic disease without the need to inject animals or humans with contrast agents.

This technology features a light-emitting reaction between enzymes (luciferases) and small molecule substrates (luciferins). Photons produced from luciferase-luciferin reactions can penetrate through heterogeneous tissue, enabling readouts of physiological processes. Dozens of bioluminescent probes are now available and many are routinely used to monitor cell proliferation, migration, and gene expression patterns in vivo.Despite the ubiquity of bioluminescence, traditional applications have been largely limited to imaging one biological feature at a time. Only a handful of luciferase-luciferin pairs can be easily used in tandem, and most are poorly resolved in living animals. Efforts to develop spectrally distinct reporters have been successful, but multispectral imaging in large organisms remains a formidable challenge due to interference from surrounding tissue. Consequently, a lack of well-resolved probes has precluded multicomponent tracking. An expanded collection of bioluminescent probes would provide insight into processes where multiple cell types drive physiological tasks, including immune function and organ development.We aimed to expand the bioluminescent toolkit by developing substrate-resolved imaging agents. The goal was to generate multiple orthogonal (i.e., noncross-reactive) luciferases that are responsive to unique scaffolds and could be used concurrently in living animals. We adopted a parallel engineering approach to genetically modify luciferases to accept chemically modified luciferins. When the mutants and analogs are combined, light is produced only when complementary enzyme-substrate partners interact. Thus, the pairs can be distinguished based on substrate selectivity, regardless of the color of light emitted. Sequential administration of the luciferins enables the unique luciferases to be illuminated (and thus resolved) within complex environments, including whole organisms.This Account describes our efforts to develop orthogonal bioluminescent probes, crafting custom luciferases (or ""biological flashlights"") that can selectively process luciferin analogs (or ""batteries"") to produce light. In the first section, we describe synthetic methods that were key to accessing diverse luciferin architectures. The second section focuses on identifying complementary luciferase enzymes via a combination of mutagenesis and screening. To expedite the search for orthogonal enzymes and substrates, we developed a computational algorithm to sift through large data sets. The third section features examples of the parallel engineering approach. We identified orthogonal enzyme-substrate pairs comprising two different classes of luciferins. The probes were vetted both in cells and whole organisms. This expanded collection of imaging agents is applicable to studies of immune function and other multicomponent processes. The final section of the Account highlights ongoing work toward building better bioluminescent tools. As ever-brighter and more selective probes are developed, the frontiers of what we can ""see"" in vivo will continue to expand.

Encapsulation of pharmaceutical agents into a nanocarrier can enhance their bioavailability and biocompatibility, whilst also facilitating targeted drug delivery to specific locations within the body. However, detailed understanding of the in vivo activity of the nanocarrier-drug conjugate is required prior to regulatory approval as a safe and effective treatment strategy. A comprehensive understanding of how nanocarriers travel to, and interact with, the intended target is required in order to optimize the dosing strategy, reduce potential off-target effects, and unwanted toxic effects.

Oral epithelial dysplasia and cancer development is accompanied by morphological, biochemical, and metabolic tissue and cellular alterations that can modulate the autofluorescence properties of the oral epithelial tissue. Objective: This study aimed to test the hypothesis that autofluorescence biomarkers of oral precancer and cancer can be clinically imaged and quantified by means of multispectral fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) endoscopy. Methods: Multispectral autofluorescence lifetime images of precancerous and cancerous lesions from 39 patients were imaged in vivo using a novel multispectral FLIM endoscope and processed to generate widefield maps of biochemical and metabolic autofluorescence biomarkers of oral precancer and cancer. Results: Statistical analyses applied to the quantified multispectral FLIM endoscopy based autofluorescence biomarkers indicated their potential to provide contrast between precancerous/cancerous vs. healthy oral epithelial tissue.

However, many of them fail when classifying specific regions with low contrast between tissues. In this work, we propose an alternative pseudo multispectral classification (PMC) technique using CIE LAB spaces instead of gray scale T1-weighted MPRAGE images, combined with a new preprocessing technique for contrast enhancement and an optimized iterative K-means clustering. To improve the accuracy of the classification process, gray scale images were converted to multispectral CIE LAB data by applying several transformation matrices. Thus, the amount of information associated with each image voxel was increased. The image contrast was then enhanced by applying a real time function that separates brain tissue distributions and improve image contrast in certain brain regions. The data were then classified using an optimized iterative and convergent K-means classifier. The performance of the proposed approach was assessed using simulation and in vivo human studies through comparison with three common software packages used for brain MR image segmentation, namely FSL, SPM8 and K-means clustering. In the presence of high SNR, the results showed that the four algorithms achieve a good classification. Conversely, in the presence of low SNR, PMC was shown to outperform the other methods by accurately recovering all tissue volumes. The quantitative assessment of brain tissue classification for simulated studies showed that the PMC algorithm resulted in a mean Jaccard index (JI) of 0.74 compared to 0.75 for FSL, 0.7 for SPM and 0.8 for K-means. The in vivo human studies showed that the PMC algorithm resulted in a mean JI of 0.92, which reflects a good spatial overlap between segmented and actual volumes, compared to 0.84 for FSL, 0.78 for SPM and 0.66 for K-means. The proposed algorithm presents a high potential for improving the accuracy of automatic brain tissues classification and was found to be accurate even in the presence of high noise level. © 2019 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","Institute of Physics Publishing","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In this work, multi-wavelength (532-, 655- and 850- nm) LSCI technique combined with hyperspectral camera and diffuse reflectance imaging method will be used for assessment of tissues with different skin perfusion properties.

Herein, we constructed innovative multifunctional nanotheranostic MnO2-mSiO2@Au-HA nanoparticles (MAHNPs) based on one-pot MnO2-mSiO2 nanohybrids (MNHs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) for multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT)/computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-guided hypoxia-maneuvered radiotherapy. The MNHs were prepared via a facile one-pot approach, which avoided the leakage of MnO2 nanoparticles and increased the synthetic efficiency. The Mn2+ ions triggered the breakdown of endogenous H2O2 to generate O2 to convert the hypoxic tumor micro-environment (TME), thus enhancing radiotherapy by self-supply oxygen. In addition, hyaluronic acid (HA) was employed to modify the surface of the MnO2-mSiO2@Au nanoparticles to improve their biocompatibility and cellular uptake. The well-designed nanoparticles could perform remarkable photothermal therapy (PTT) and hypoxia-maneuvered radiotherapy (RT) simultaneously and MSOT/CT/MR imaging.

Although animal studies show that certain nanomaterials can cross the skin barrier, physiological differences between human and animal skin, such as the lack of sweat glands, limit the translational validity of these results. Current optical microscopy methods have limited capabilities to visualize ENMs within human skin tissues due to the high amount of background light scattering caused by the dense, ubiquitous extracellular matrix (ECM) of the skin. Here, we hypothesized that organic solvent-based tissue clearing (“immunolabeling-enabled three-dimensional imaging of solvent-cleared organs”, or “iDISCO”) would reduce background light scattering from the extracellular matrix of the skin to sufficiently improve imaging contrast for both 2D mapping of unlabeled metal oxide ENMs and 3D mapping of fluorescent nanoparticles. We successfully mapped the 2D distribution of label-free TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles in cleared skin sections using correlated signals from darkfield, brightfield, and confocal microscopy, as well as micro-spectroscopy. Specifically, hyperspectral microscopy and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the identity of label-free ENMs which we mapped within human skin sections. We also measured the 3D distribution of fluorescently labeled Ag nanoparticles in cleared skin biopsies with wounded epidermal layers using light sheet fluorescence microscopy. Overall, this study explores a novel strategy for quantitatively mapping ENM distributions in cleared ex vivo human skin tissue models using multiple imaging modalities. By improving the imaging contrast, we present label-free 2D ENM tracking and 3D ENM mapping as promising capabilities for nanotoxicology investigations. © 2020","Elsevier B.V.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Laser speckle imaging (LSI) is a full-field, real-time imaging technique capable of mapping microvessel networks and providing relative flow velocity within the vessels. In this study, we demonstrate that LSI combine with multispectral reflectance imaging (MSRI), which allows for distinction between veins and arteries in the vascular flow maps produced by LSI. We apply this combined technique to mouse cerebral vascular network in vivo, comparing imaging through the skull, to the dura mater and brain directly through a craniectomy, and through a transparent cranial “Window to the Brain” (WttB) implant. Study Design/Materials and Methods: The WttB implant used in this study is made of a nanocrystalline Yttria-Stabilized-Zirconia ceramic. MSRI was conducted using white-light illumination and filtering the reflected light for 560, 570, 580, 590, 600, and 610 nm. LSI was conducted using an 810 nm continuous wave near-infrared laser with incident power of 100 mW, and the reflected speckle pattern was captured by a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) camera. Results: Seven vessel branches were analyzed and comparison was made between imaging through the skull, craniectomy, and WttB implant. Through the skull, MSRI did not detect any vessels, and LSI could not image microvessels. Imaging through the WttB implant, MSRI was able to identify veins versus arteries, and LSI was able to image microvessels with only slightly higher signal-to-noise ratio and lower sharpness than imaging the brain through a craniectomy. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the ability to perform MSRI-LSI across a transparent cranial implant, to allow for cerebral vascular networks to be mapped, including microvessels. These images contain additional information such as vein-artery separation and relative blood flow velocities, information which is of value scientifically and medically. The WttB implant provides substantial improvements over imaging through the murine cranial bone, where microvessels are not visible and MSRI cannot be performed. Lasers Surg.

Herein, the multifunctional nanoplatforms for thermoradiotherapy have been successfully constructed by the embedding of tungsten disulfide quantum dots (WS2 QDs) into mesoporous polydopamine nanosponges (MPDA NSs), followed by integration with manganese dioxide (MnO2). MPDA-WS2@MnO2, the resultant nanoplatforms, exhibit radiosensitization enhanced behavior and a capacity for responsive oxygen self-supplementation. The ingenious mesoporous structure of MPDA NSs serves as reservoir for the assembly of WS2 QDs to form MPDA-WS2 nanoparticles (NPs), in which WS2 QDs provide the radiation enhancement effect, whereas the MPDA NSs framework endows the MPDA-WS2@MnO2 with an excellent photothermal capability. Additionally, the integration of the MnO2 component works to decompose the tumor-overexpressed H2O2 and alleviate tumor hypoxia subsequently, which has been demonstrated to enhance radiotherapy performance considerably. Meanwhile, the prepared MPDA-WS2@MnO2 nanoplatforms have been evaluated as trimodality contrast agents for computed tomography (CT), multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), and tumor microenvironment-responsive T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging that have the potential for real-time guidance and monitoring during cancer therapy. More importantly, when subjected to near infrared (NIR) laser irradiation and X-ray exposure, the tumor is found to be inhibited significantly through the process of combined thermoradiotherapy.

We developed a non-invasive, real-time, label-free imaging technique for assessing the level of ROS in live cells and thawed cryopreserved tissues that is compatible with in-vivo imaging. The technique is based on autofluorescence multispectral imaging (AFMI) carried out in an adapted fluorescence microscope with an expanded number of spectral channels spanning specific excitation (365 nm–495 nm) and emission (420 nm–700 nm) wavelength ranges. We established a strong quantitative correlation between the spectral information obtained from AFMI and the level of ROS obtained from CellROX staining. The results were obtained in several cell types (HeLa, PANC1 and mesenchymal stem cells) and in live kidney tissue. Additioanly,two spectral regimes were considered: with and without UV excitation (wavelengths > 400 nm); the latter being suitable for UV-sensitive systems such as the eye. Data were analyzed by linear regression combined with an optimization method of swarm intelligence. This allowed the calibration of AFMI signals to the level of ROS with excellent correlation (R = 0.84, p = 0.00) in the entire spectral range and very good correlation (R = 0.78, p = 0.00) in the limited, UV-free spectral range. We also developed a strong classifier which allowed us to distinguish moderate and high levels of ROS in these two regimes (AUC = 0.91 in the entire spectral range and AUC = 0.78 for UV-free imaging). These results indicate that ROS in cells and tissues can be imaged non-invasively, which opens the way to future clinical applications in conditions where reactive oxygen species are known to contribute to progressive disease such as in ophthalmology, diabetes, kidney disease, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. © 2020 The Authors","Elsevier B.V.","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Most systems that capture spectral image data are large, heavy, and expensive. This paper presents a full end-to-end analysis of a low-cost reflectance-mode multispectral imaging system operating in the visible and near-infrared spectra. The system consists of 13 LEDs mounted on a printed circuit board, a monochrome machine vision camera, and a tablet computer to control the hardware. The bill of materials for the system is less than $1000. Hardware design and implementation are detailed. Calibration, image capture, and preprocessing are also discussed. In validation experiments, excellent agreement is observed in diffuse reflectance measurements between the spectral camera setup and a spectrometer. To demonstrate that such spectral image data can yield meaningful optical measurements in vivo, the forearms of eight volunteers are imaged in the system. Their data are then analyzed to estimate the tissue optical properties of different skin layers using a Monte Carlo lookup table. In three volunteers, spectral images are captured before and after inducing erythema using a warm wet towel. Across the three subjects, a clear increase in the blood content of the superficial plexus layer was observed as a result of the erythema.

Current Canadian regulations do not require product labeling for ingredients that are present in the nanoscale. As a result, unless voluntarily disclosed, it is unclear which products contain NM. The enhanced dark-field hyperspectral imaging (EDF-HSI) coupled with spectral angle mapping (SAM) is a recent technique that has shown much promise for detection of NM in complex matrices. In the present study, EDF-HSI was used to screen cosmetic inventories for the presence of nano silver (nAg), nano gold (nAu), and nano titanium dioxide (nTiO2). In addition, we also assessed the potential of EDF-HSI as a tool to detect NM in skin layers following application of NM products in vitro on commercially available artificial skin constructs (ASCs) and in vivo on albino hairless SKH-1 mouse skin. Spectroscopic analysis positively detected nAu (4/9 products) and nTiO2 (7/13 products), but no nAg (0/6 products) in a subset of the cosmetics. The exposure of ASCs for 24 h in a Franz diffusion cell system to a diluted cosmetic containing nTiO2 revealed penetrance of nTiO2 through the epidermal layers and was detectable in the receptor fluid. Moreover, both single and multiple applications of nTiO2 containing cosmetics on the dorsal surface of SKH-1 mice resulted in detectable levels of trace nTiO2 in the layers of the skin indicating that penetrance of NM was occurring after each application of the product. The current study demonstrates the sensitivity of EDF-HSI with SAM mapping for qualitative detection of NM present in cosmetic products per se and very low levels in complex biological matrices on which these products are applied. © Published 2020 by the American Chemical Society.","American Chemical Society","Article","","Scopus"

In this regard, hyperspectral imaging (HSI), combined with unmixing algorithms, is a promising tool that can allow for efficient multiplexing of the SWIR-emitting nanoagents by their photoluminescence (PL) spectral profiles. The SWIR HSI technique reported here is developed to multiplex two types of nanoprobes: polymeric nanoparticles doped with organic dye (PNPs) and rare-earth doped fluoride nanoparticles (RENPs). Both types of nanoprobes exhibit PL in the same spectral range (~ 900–1200 nm), which hinders spectral separation of PL with optical filters and limits possibilities for their multiplexed imaging in biological tissues. By applying SWIR HSI, we exploited differences in the PL spectral profiles and achieved the spectrally selective and sensitive imaging of the PL signal from every type of nanoparticles. Unmixing of acquired data allowed for multiplexing of the spectrally overlapping nanoprobes by their PL profile. Both quantitative and spatial distribution for every type of nanoparticles were obtained from their mixed suspensions. Finally, the SWIR HSI technique with unmixing protocol was applied to in vivo imaging of mice subcutaneously injected with PNPs and RENPs. The applicability of hyperspectral techniques to multiplex nanoprobes in the in vivo imaging was successfully demonstrated. © 2019, The Author(s).","Springer New York LLC","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In the medical field, HSI has commonly been investigated due to its great potential for diagnostic and surgical guidance purposes. However, the large amount of information provided by HSI normally contains redundant or non-relevant information, and it is extremely important to identify the most relevant wavelengths for a certain application in order to improve the accuracy of the predictions and reduce the execution time of the classification algorithm. Additionally, some wavelengths can contain noise and removing such bands can improve the classification stage. The work presented in this paper aims to identify such relevant spectral ranges in the visual-and-near-infrared (VNIR) region for an accurate detection of brain cancer using in vivo hyperspectral images. A methodology based on optimization algorithms has been proposed for this task, identifying the relevant wavelengths to achieve the best accuracy in the classification results obtained by a supervised classifier (support vector machines), and employing the lowest possible number of spectral bands. The results demonstrate that the proposed methodology based on the genetic algorithm optimization slightly improves the accuracy of the tumor identification in ~5%, using only 48 bands, with respect to the reference results obtained with 128 bands, offering the possibility of developing customized acquisition sensors that could provide real-time HS imaging. The most relevant spectral ranges found comprise between 440.5–465.96 nm, 498.71–509.62 nm, 556.91–575.1 nm, 593.29–615.12 nm, 636.94–666.05 nm, 698.79–731.53 nm and 884.32–902.51 nm. © 2019 by the authors.

We show that endogenous bacteriochlorophyll a in Rhodobacter gives rise to strong optoacoustic signals >800 nm away from interfering endogenous absorbers. Importantly, our results suggest that changes in the spectral signature of Rhodobacter which depend on macrophage activity inside the tumor can be used to reveal heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment. Employing non-invasive high resolution MSOT in longitudinal studies we show spatiotemporal changes of Rhodobacter spectral profiles in mice bearing 4T1 and CT26.WT tumor models.

During Afib treatment, clinicians aim to repress unusual electrical activity by electrically isolating the pulmonary veins (PV) from the left atrium (LA) using radiofrequency ablation. However, current clinical tools are limited in reliably assessing transmurality of the ablation lesions and detecting the presence of gaps within ablation lines, which can warrant repeat procedures. In this study, we developed an endoscopic multispectral reflectance imaging (eMSI) system for enhanced discrimination of tissue treatment at the PV junction. The system enables direct visualization of cardiac lesions through an endoscope at acquisition rates up to 25 Hz. Five narrowband, high-power LEDs were used to illuminate the sample (450, 530, 625, 810 and 940nm) and combinatory parameters were calculated based on their relative reflectance. A stitching algorithm was employed to generate large field-of view, multispectral mosaics of the ablated PV junction from individual eMSI images. A total of 79 lesions from 15 swine hearts were imaged, ex vivo. Statistical analysis of the acquired five spectral data sets and ratiometric maps revealed significant differences between transmural lesions, non-transmural lesions around the venoatrial junctions, unablated posterior wall of left atrium tissue, and pulmonary vein (p < 0.0001). A pixel-based quadratic discriminant analysis classifier was applied to distinguish four tissue types: PV, untreated LA, non-transmural and transmural lesions. We demonstrate tissue type classification accuracies of 80.2% and 92.1% for non-transmural and transmural lesions, and 95.0% and 92.8% for PV and untreated LA sites, respectively. These findings showcase the potential of eMSI for lesion validation and may help to improve AFib treatment efficacy. © 2019 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.","OSA - The Optical Society","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

We injected quantum dot labeled MSCs via tail vein to mice receiving BMT and analyzed hMSC biodistribution in major organs (e.g. lung, liver, spleen, kidneys and bone marrow). We compared the biodistribution of hMSCs in mice following allogeneic BMT recipients (with GVHD) to the biodistribution following syngeneic BMT (without GVHD). Cryo-imaging system revealed cellular biodistribution and redistribution patterns in the animal model. We initially found clusters of cells in the lung that eventually dissociated to single cells and redistributed to other organs within 72 h. The in vivo half-life of the exogenous MSCs was about 21 h. We found that the biodistribution of stromal cells was not related to blood flow, rather cells preferentially homed to specific organs. In conclusion, cryo-imaging was suitable for analyzing the cellular biodistribution. It could provide capabilities of visualizing cells anywhere in the mouse model with single cell sensitivity. By characterizing the biodistribution and anatomical specificity of a therapeutic cellular product, we believe that cryo-imaging can play an important role in the advancement of stem and stromal cell therapies and regenerative medicine. © 2020, Biomedical Engineering Society.","Springer","Article","","Scopus"

Despite acquiring dozens to thousands of spectral channels, existing technology cannot capture spectral images at the same spatial resolution as structural microscopy. Due to partial voluming and low light exposure, spectral images are often difficult to interpret and analyze. This highlights a need to upsample the low-resolution spectral image by using spatial information contained in the high-resolution image, thereby creating a fused representation with high specificity both spatially and spectrally. In this paper, we propose a framework for the fusion of co-registered structural and spectral microscopy images to create super-resolved representations of spectral images. As a first application, we super-resolve spectral images of ex-vivo retinal tissue imaged with confocal laser scanning microscopy, by using spatial information from structured illumination microscopy. Second, we super-resolve mass spectroscopic images of mouse brain tissue, by using spatial information from high-resolution histology images. We present a systematic validation of model assumptions crucial towards maintaining the original nature of spectra and the applicability of super-resolution. Goodness-of-fit for spectral predictions are evaluated through functional R2 values, and the spatial quality of the super-resolved images are evaluated using normalized mutual information. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

However, the ability of OT to distinguish breast tumours displaying different vascular characteristics has yet to be established. The aim of the study is to prove OT as a sensitive technique for differentiating breast tumour models with manifestly different vasculatures. Methods: Multispectral OT (MSOT) was performed in oestrogen-dependent (MCF-7) and oestrogen-independent (MDA-MB-231) orthotopic breast cancer xenografts. Total haemoglobin (THb) and oxygen saturation (SO2 MSOT) were calculated. Pathological and biochemical evaluation of the tumour vascular phenotype was performed for validation. Results: MCF-7 tumours show SO2 MSOT similar to healthy tissue in both rim and core, despite significantly lower THb in the core. MDA-MB-231 tumours show markedly lower SO2 MSOT with a significant rim-core disparity. Ex vivo analysis revealed that MCF-7 tumours contain fewer blood vessels (CD31+) that are more mature (CD31+/aSMA+) than MDA-MB-231. MCF-7 presented higher levels of stromal VEGF and iNOS, with increased NO serum levels. The vasculogenic process observed in MCF-7 was consistent with angiogenesis, while MDA-MB-231 appeared to rely more on vascular mimicry. Conclusions: OT is sensitive to differences in the vascular phenotypes of our breast cancer models. © 2018 The Author(s).","Nature Publishing Group","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Although sO2 changes can be an indicator of brain activity both in normal and in pathological conditions, PA imaging of the brain has mainly focused on small animal models with lissencephalic brains. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to investigate the usefulness of multispectral PA imaging in assessing sO2 in a gyrencephalic brain. To this end, we continuously imaged a porcine brain as part of an open neurosurgical intervention with a handheld PA and ultrasonic (US) imaging system in vivo. Throughout the experiment, we varied respiratory oxygen and continuously measured arterial blood gases. The arterial blood oxygenation (SaO2) values derived by the blood gas analyzer were used as a reference to compare the performance of linear spectral unmixing algorithms in this scenario. According to our experiment, PA imaging can be used to monitor sO2 in the porcine cerebral cortex. While linear spectral unmixing algorithms are well-suited for detecting changes in oxygenation, there are limits with respect to the accurate quantification of sO2, especially in depth. Overall, we conclude that multispectral PA imaging can potentially be a valuable tool for change detection of sO2 in the cerebral cortex of a gyrencephalic brain.

However, making accurate sO2 measurements without knowledge of tissue- and instrumentation-related correction factors is extremely challenging. We have developed a low-cost flow phantom to facilitate validation of PAT systems. The phantom is composed of a flow circuit of tubing partially embedded within a tissue-mimicking material, with independent sensors providing online monitoring of the optical absorption spectrum and partial pressure of oxygen in the tube. We first test the flow phantom using two small molecule dyes that are frequently used for photoacoustic imaging: methylene blue and indocyanine green. We then demonstrate the potential of the phantom for evaluating sO2 using chemical oxygenation and deoxygenation of blood in the circuit. Using this dynamic assessment of the photoacoustic sO2 measurement in phantoms in relation to a ground truth, we explore the influence of multispectral processing and spectral coloring on accurate assessment of sO2. Future studies could exploit this low-cost dynamic flow phantom to validate fluence correction algorithms and explore additional blood parameters such as pH and also absorptive and other properties of different fluids. © The Authors.

Often, diagnoses are made based on endoscopic examination of the larynx followed by biopsy and histological analysis, leading to a high interobserver variability due to subjective assessment. In this regard, early non-invasive diagnostics independent of the clinician would be a valuable tool. A recent study has shown that hyperspectral imaging (HSI) can be used for non-invasive detection of head and neck tumors, as precancerous or cancerous lesions show specific spectral signatures that distinguish them from healthy tissue. However, HSI data processing is challenging due to high spectral variations, various image interferences, and the high dimensionality of the data. Therefore, performance of automatic HSI analysis has been limited and so far, mostly ex-vivo studies have been presented with deep learning. In this work, we analyze deep learning techniques for in-vivo hyperspectral laryngeal cancer detection. For this purpose we design and evaluate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with 2D spatial or 3D spatio-spectral convolutions combined with a state-of-the-art Densenet architecture. For evaluation, we use an in-vivo data set with HSI of the oral cavity or oropharynx. Overall, we present multiple deep learning techniques for in-vivo laryngeal cancer detection based on HSI and we show that jointly learning from the spatial and spectral domain improves classification accuracy notably. Our 3D spatio-spectral Densenet achieves an average accuracy of 81%. © 2020 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In this work, the extended blind end-member and abundance extraction (EBEAE) methodology is mathematically formulated to address the blind linear unmixing (BLU) problem subject to positivity constraints in optical measurements. The EBEAE algorithm is based on a constrained quadratic optimization and an alternated least-squares strategy to jointly estimate end-members and their abundances. In our proposal, a local approach is used to estimate the abundances of each end-member by maximizing their entropy, and a global technique is adopted to iteratively identify the end-members by reducing the similarity among them. All the cost functions are normalized, and four initialization approaches are suggested for the end-members matrix. Synthetic datasets are used first for the EBEAE validation at different noise types and levels, and its performance is compared to state-of-the-art algorithms in BLU. In a second stage, three experimental biomedical imaging applications are addressed with EBEAE: M-FLIM for chemometric analysis in oral cavity samples, OCT for macrophages identification in post-mortem artery samples, and hyper-spectral images for in-vivo brain tissue classification and tumor identification. In our evaluations, EBEAE was able to provide a quantitative analysis of the samples with none or minimal a priori information. © 2019 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is a recently developed non-invasive imaging tool, which offers the unique capacity for high resolution three dimensional (3D) optical mapping of tissue by further delivering highly specific optical contrast from a depth of several millimetres to centimetres in living tissues. MSOT enables volumetric, spectroscopic differentiation of tissue, both in vivo and in real time, with and without the application of biomarker-specific probes, and is further able of providing spatial maps of skin chromophores, as well as underlying blood vasculature. Methods: Three patients with suspicious skin tumours consented to have their lesions imaged with MSOT prior to excision. The histological findings and measurements were compared. Results: We demonstrated the first in vivo clinical use of MSOT for 3D reconstruction of skin tumours in three patients with good histological correlation. Conclusion: Our findings confirm the potential benefit of the new imaging method in guiding surgical intervention to achieve a more precise excision with better clearance and lower relapse rates. It can also potentially help to shorten the duration of Mohs’ micrographic surgery. Further large-scale studies are necessary to ensure correlation between MSOT and histology. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The purpose of this chapter is to (1) summarize current methods of melanoma detection and (2) review state-of-the-art detection methods and technologies that have the potential to reduce melanoma mortality. Current strategies for the detection of melanoma range from population-based educational campaigns and screening to the use of algorithm-driven imaging technologies and performance of assays that identify markers of transformation.This chapter will begin by describing state-of-the-art methods for educating and increasing awareness of at-risk individuals and for performing comprehensive screening examinations. Standard and advanced photographic methods designed to improve reliability and reproducibility of the clinical examination will also be reviewed. Devices that magnify and/or enhance malignant features of individual melanocytic lesions (and algorithms that are available to interpret the results obtained from these devices) will be compared and contrasted. In vivo confocal microscopy and other cellular-level in vivo technologies will be compared to traditional tissue biopsy, and the role of a noninvasive “optical biopsy” in the clinical setting will be discussed. Finally, cellular and molecular methods that have been applied to the diagnosis of melanoma, such as comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), will be discussed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Kluwer Academic Publishers","Book chapter","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Although effective, SLN excision is an invasive procedure requiring radioactive tracing. Novel imaging approaches assessing SLN metastatic status could improve or replace conventional lymph node excision protocols. In our firstin-human study, we used noninvasive multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) to image SLNs ex vivo and in vivo in patients with melanoma, to determine metastatic status. MSOT significantly improved the tumor metastasis detection rate in excised SLN (506 SLNs from 214 melanoma patients) compared with the conventional EORTC (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer) Melanoma Group protocol (22.9% versus 14.2%). MSOT combined with the near-infrared fluorophore indocyanine green reliably visualized SLNs in vivo in 20 patients, up to 5-cm penetration and with 100% concordance with 99mTc-marked SLN lymphoscintigraphy. MSOT identified cancer-free SLNs in vivo and ex vivo without a single false negative (189 total lymph nodes), with 100% sensitivity and 48 to 62% specificity. Our findings indicate that a noninvasive, nonradioactive MSOT-based approach can identify and determine SLN status and confidently rule out the presence of metastasis. The study further demonstrates that optoacoustic imaging strategies can improve the identification of SLN metastasis as an alternative to current invasive SLN excision protocols.","American Association for the Advancement of Science","Article","","Scopus"

However, in complex imaging situations like HSI of the larynx with a rigid endoscope, various image interferences can disable a proper classification of cancerous tissue. We identified three main problems: i) misregistration of single images in a HS cube due to patient heartbeat ii) image noise and iii) specular reflections (SR). Consequently, an image pre-processor is developed in the current paper to overcome these image interferences. It encompasses i) image registration ii) noise removal by minimum noise fraction (MNF) transformation and iii) a novel SR detection method. The results reveal that the pre-processor improves classification performance, while the newly developed SR detection method outperforms global thresholding technique hitherto used by 46%.

These reflectances encode information on important physiological parameters not visible to the naked eye. Fast decoding of the data during surgery, however, remains challenging. While model-based methods suffer from inaccurate base assumptions, a major bottleneck related to competing machine learning-based solutions is the lack of labelled training data. In this paper, we address this issue with the first transfer learning-based method to physiological parameter estimation from multispectral images. It relies on a highly generic tissue model that aims to capture the full range of optical tissue parameters that can potentially be observed in vivo. Adaptation of the model to a specific clinical application based on unlabelled in vivo data is achieved using a new concept of domain adaptation that explicitly addresses the high variance often introduced by conventional covariance-shift correction methods. According to comprehensive in silico and in vivo experiments our approach enables accurate parameter estimation for various tissue types without the need for incorporating specific prior knowledge on optical properties and could thus pave the way for many exciting applications in multispectral laparoscopy. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Springer Verlag","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The signal analysis discriminated different starch concentration only at the amide-I band, whereas it was insensitive in the near infrared range, where the starch is not absorptive, although diffusive. Following the demonstration of optical feedback interferometry sensitivity to chemical absorption, chemical imaging of in-vivo tissues would become foreseeable. © 2018 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

Biomedical applications exploiting this large family of fluorophores will require the spectral and spatial resolution of individual (n,m) nanotube species € fluorescence and its modulation within live cells and tissues, which is not possible with current microscopy methods. We present a wide-field hyperspectral approach to spatially delineate and spectroscopically measure single nanotube fluorescence in living systems. This approach resolved up to 17 distinct (n,m) species (chiralities) with single nanotube spatial resolution in live mammalian cells, murine tissues ex vivo, and zebrafish endothelium in vivo. We anticipate that this approach will facilitate multiplexed nanotube imaging in biomedical applications while enabling deep-tissue optical penetration, and single-molecule resolution in vivo.","Nature Publishing Group","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

We interrogated whether handheld multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) could noninvasively monitor the effect of VTP using WST11, a vascular-acting photosensitizer, on tumor tissues over time using a renal cell cancer mouse model. We also investigated whether MSOT illumination can induce VTP, to implement a single-modality theranostic approach. Materials and Methods: Eight BalB/c mice were subcutaneously implanted with murine renal adenocarcinoma cells (RENCA) on the flank. Three weeks later VTP was performed (10 min continuous illumination at 753 nm following intravenous infusion) using WST11 or saline as control. Handheld MSOT images were collected prior to VTP administration and subsequently thereafter over the course of the first hour, at 24 and 48 h. Data collected were unmixed for blood oxygen saturation in tissue (SO2) based on the spectral signatures of deoxy- and oxygenated hemoglobin. Changes in oxygen saturation over time, relative to baseline, were examined by paired t-test for statistical significance (p < 0.05). In-vivo findings were corroborated by histological analyses of the tumor tissue. Results: MSOT is shown to prominently resolve changes in oxygen saturation in tumors within the first 20 min post WST11-VTP treatment. Within the first hour post-treatment, SO2 decreased by more than 60% over baseline (p < 0.05), whereas it remained unchanged (p > 0.1) in the sham-treated group. Moreover, unlike in the control group, SO2 in treated tumors further decreased over the course of 24 to 48 h post-treatment, concomitant with the propagation of profound central tumor necrosis present in histological analysis. We further show that pulsed MSOT illumination can activate WST11 as efficiently as the continuous wave irradiation employed for treatment. Conclusion: Handheld MSOT non-invasively monitored WST11-VTP effects based on the SO2 signal and detected blood saturation changes within the first 20 min post-treatment. MSOT may potentially serve as a means for both VTP induction and real-time VTP monitoring in a theranostic approach. © Ivyspring International Publisher.","Ivyspring International Publisher","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

While combined MR/PAI detection of cells requires biocompatible cell labeling probes, water-based synthesis of dual-modality MR/PAI probes presents significant technical challenges. Here we describe facile synthesis and characterization of hybrid modular dextran-stabilized gold/iron oxide (Au-IO) multimetallic nanoparticles (NP) enabling multimodal imaging of cells. The stable association between the IO and gold NP was achieved by priming the surface of dextran-coated IO with silver NP resulting from silver(I) reduction by aldehyde groups, which are naturally present within the dextran coating of IO at the level of 19-23 groups/particle. The Au-IO NP formed in the presence of silver-primed Au-IO were stabilized by using partially thiolated MPEG5-gPLL graft copolymer carrying residual amino groups. This stabilizer served as a carrier of near-infrared fluorophores (e.g., IRDye 800RS) for multispectral PA imaging. Dual modality imaging experiments performed in capillary phantoms of purified Au-IO-800RS NPs showed that these NPs were detectible using 3T MRI at a concentration of 25 μM iron. PA imaging achieved approximately 2.5-times higher detection sensitivity due to strong PA signal emissions at 530 and 770 nm, corresponding to gold plasmons and IRDye integrated into the coating of the hybrid NPs, respectively, with no bleaching of PA signal. MDA-MB-231 cells prelabeled with Au-IO-800RS retained plasma membrane integrity and were detectable by using both MR and dual-wavelength PA at 49 ± 3 cells/imaging voxel. We believe that modular assembly of multimetallic NPs shows promise for imaging analysis of engineered cells and tissues with high resolution and sensitivity. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","American Chemical Society","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

One of the two xenografts developed afterwards was used for the treatment with a recombinant vaccinia virus, while the other xenograft served as an artificial metastasis. We used the attenuated recombinant vaccinia virus (VACV) VVdGF-GFP2 of the L-IVP strain (GenBank accession number KP233807) with the deletion of two virulence genes, i.e., the genes of the virus growth factor and thymidine kinase, with the gene for the green fluorescent protein (GFP2) inserted in the place of the latter. The treatment was performed by a single intratumoral injection of recombinant VACV at a dose of 107 PFU/mouse. VACV was detected in cells of the artificial metastasis as early as two days after infection. After eight days, the virus concentration was comparable with that in the infected tumor (~109 PFU/mL). Electron microscopy revealed selective replication of the recombinant virus in the tumor cells. The targeted accumulation of GFP2 in both tumor and metastasis was shown in the UV images of the mice obtained using the In-vivo Multispectral Imaging System (Bruker, Germany). The complete destruction of the tumor was detected after 12 days, and that of metastasis, after 20 days after the injection of VVdGF-GFP2. The destruction process was accompanied by pronounced edema and leukocyte infiltration of the tumor tissue. The recombinant virus induced a significant reduction in the sizes of the tumor and metastasis. By the end of the experiment (35 days), the xenografts in the control mice were 10 times larger than those in the treated mice (5000 vs 500 mm3). Our study has shown that the attenuated VACV administered by the peripheral route can not only destroy the primary tumor but also has a distinct antimetastatic effect. © 2016, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Maik Nauka Publishing / Springer SBM","Article","","Scopus"

We have previously demonstrated a cost-effective alternative using cascaded stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in an optical fiber. An optical fiber pumped by a compact 1047 nm pulsed laser produces multiple Stokes lines at 1098, 1153, 1215, and 1284 nm. Disadvantages of this system are the fixed wavelength and broad spectral linewidth of each Stokes line. In this paper, we explore a technique to overcome these disadvantages by injection-seeding the Raman fiber amplifier. Our pump laser is a 1047 nm 2.5 kHz Q-switched Nd:YLF laser producing 14 ns pulses with 140 uJ of energy. The seed laser is a 1206 nm multimode diode laser with a 3 nm linewidth. All experiments are performed in a 100 meter long single-mode fiber. When the seed laser is present, the third Stokes line occurs at 1206 nm (11 nm linewidth). Without the seed laser, the third Stokes line occurs at 1215 nm (30 nm linewidth). The pulse energy in both cases is approximately 9 uJ. Multispectral PAM experiments are performed at 1047, 1098, 1153, 1206, and 1274 nm. A thin butter strip between 1 mm thick pieces of chicken breast meat is clearly visualized by our system, as well the fat bodies within Drosophila larva fixed in formalin. Our injection-seeded Raman amplifier has the capability of producing 1195 to 1220 nm laser pulses by tuning the seed laser wavelength. Therefore, we believe this system can benefit many in vivo PAM applications of lipid imaging. © 2016 IEEE.","IEEE Computer Society","Conference paper","","Scopus"

To use hyperspectral imaging for in vivo monitoring and diagnosis of the internal body cavities, a snapshot hyperspectral video-endoscope is required. However, such reported systems provide only about 50 wavelengths. We have developed a four-dimensional snapshot hyperspectral video-endoscope with a spectral range of 400-1000 nm, which can detect 756 wavelengths for imaging, significantly more than such systems. Capturing the three-dimensional datacube sequentially gives the fourth dimension. All these are achieved through a flexible two-dimensional to one-dimensional fiber bundle. The potential of this custom designed and fabricated compact biomedical probe is demonstrated by imaging phantom tissue samples in reflectance and fluorescence imaging modalities. It is envisaged that this novel concept and developed probe will contribute significantly towards diagnostic in vivo biomedical imaging in the near future.","Nature Publishing Group","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

One critical aspect of in vivo nanoparticle use is the characterization of biodistribution profiles. Such studies improve our understanding of particle uptake, specificity, and clearance mechanisms. Currently, the most prevalent nanoparticle biodistribution methods provide either aspatial quantification of whole-organ particle accumulation or nanometerresolution images of uptake in single cells. Few existing techniques are well-suited to study particle uptake on the micron to millimeter scales relevant to sub-tissue physiology. Here we demonstrate a new method called Hyperspectral Microscopy with Adaptive Detection (HSM-AD) that uses machine learning classification of hyperspectral dark-field images to study interactions between tissues and administered nanoparticles. This label-free, non-destructive method enables quantitative particle identification in histological sections and detailed observations of sub-organ accumulation patterns consistent with organ-specific clearance mechanisms, particle size, and the molecular specificity of the nanoparticle surface. Unlike studies with electron microscopy, HSM-AD is readily applied for large fields of view. HSM-AD achieves excellent detection sensitivity (99.4%) and specificity (99.7%) and can identify single nanoparticles. To demonstrate HSM-AD's potential for novel nanoparticle uptake studies, we collected the first data on the sub-organ localization of large gold nanorods (LGNRs) in mice. We also observed differences in particle accumulation and localization patterns in tumors as a function of conjugated molecular targeting moieties. Thus, HSM-AD affords new degrees of detail for the study of nanoparticle uptake at physiological scales. HSM-AD may offer an auxiliary or alternative approach to study the biodistribution profiles of existing and novel nanoparticles. © 2017 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

In a recent study, we carried on backscattering Muller matrix imaging on living nude mice skin using oblique illumination by a 633nm LED light source. We quantitatively measured how the anisotropy properties of the living mice skin changes as functions of the UV exposure time. The time course features provide vital clue for the mechanism of UV damage and the effectiveness of sunscreen for reducing such damage. In this work, we report an upgraded system with LED light sources of five different colors ranging from blue to red. The system is calibrated by taking multi-color Mueller matrix images using a single set of rotating achromatic quarter-wave plates. In both in situ applications on living nude mice skin and ex vivo imaging of thick fresh tissue samples, we demonstrated that the multi-color polarized light backscattering measurements are able to reveal more details on the microstructure of the sample, particularly helpful in separating different effects due to photon scattering and propagation. © 2018 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Univariate logistic regression showed cancerous tissue samples had significantly lower intensity than noncancerous tissue for 17 image types. The predictive power of multiple image types was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression (MLR) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA). Two MLR models each using two image types had receiver operating characteristic curves with area under the curve exceeding 0.9. QDA determined 56 image type combinations with perfect resubstituting using as few as five image types. Adaption of the system for future in vivo fallopian tube and ovary endoscopic imaging is possible, which may enable sensitive detection of ovarian cancer with no exogenous contrast agents. © 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","SPIE","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Optoacoustic imaging has been shown to offer exclusive applicability across multiple scales with excellent optical contrast and high resolution in deep-Tissue observations. Yet, efficient visualization of multi-scale dynamics remained difficult with state-of-The-Art systems due to inefficient trade-offs between image acquisition time and effective field of view. Herein, we introduce the spiral volumetric optoacoustic tomography technique that provides spectrally enriched high-resolution contrast across multiple spatiotemporal scales. In vivo experiments in mice demonstrate a wide range of dynamic imaging capabilities, from three-dimensional high-frame-rate visualization of moving organs and contrast agent kinetics in selected areas to whole-body longitudinal studies with unprecedented image quality.

Experimental Design: A clinical study was conducted in order to collect and image fresh, surgical specimens from patients (N = 36) with head and neck cancers undergoing surgical resection. A set of machine-learning tools were developed to quantify hyperspectral images of the resected tissue in order to detect and delineate cancerous regions which were validated by histopathologic diagnosis. More than two million reflectance spectral signatures were obtained by HSI and analyzed using machine-learning methods. The detection results of HSI were compared with autofluorescence imaging and fluorescence imaging of two vital-dyes of the same specimens. Results: Quantitative HSI differentiated cancerous tissue from normal tissue in ex vivo surgical specimens with a sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 91%, respectively, and which was more accurate than autofluorescence imaging (P < 0.05) or fluorescence imaging of 2-NBDG (P < 0.05) and proflavine (P < 0.05). The proposed quantification tools also generated cancer probability maps with the tumor border demarcated and which could provide real-time guidance for surgeons regarding optimal tumor resection. Conclusions: This study highlights the feasibility of using quantitative HSI as a diagnostic tool to delineate the cancer boundaries in surgical specimens, and which could be translated into the clinic application with the hope of improving clinical outcomes in the future. ©2017 AACR.","American Association for Cancer Research Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, maps of the PpIX biodistribution within the surgical field based on either visual perception or the raw fluorescence emissions can be masked by background signals or distorted by variations in tissue optical properties. This study evaluates the impact of algorithmic processing of hyperspectral imaging acquisitions on the sensitivity and contrast of PpIX maps. Measurements in tissue-simulating phantoms showed that (I) spectral fitting enhanced PpIX sensitivity compared with visible or integrated fluorescence, (II) confidence-filtering automatically determined the lower limit of detection based on the strength of the PpIX spectral signature in the collected emission spectrum (0.014–0.041 μg/ml in phantoms), and (III) optical-property corrected PpIX estimates were more highly correlated with independent probe measurements (r = 0.98) than with spectral fitting alone (r = 0.91) or integrated fluorescence (r = 0.82). Application to in vivo case examples from clinical neurosurgeries revealed changes to the localization and contrast of PpIX maps, making concentrations accessible that were not visually apparent. Adoption of these methods has the potential to maintain sensitive and accurate visualization of PpIX contrast over the course of surgery. © 2017, The Author(s).","Nature Publishing Group","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

During mid 1990's medical imaging research begun to use Photo Acoustic effect and in vivo images were obtained in mid-2000. Since 2009, the number of patent related to Photo Acoustic Imaging (PAI) has dramatically increased. PAI machines for pre-clinical and small animal imaging have been being used in a routine way for several years. Based on its very interesting features (non-ionizing radiation, noninvasive, high depth resolution ratio, scalability, moderate price) and because it is able to deliver not only anatomical, but functional and molecular information, PAI is a very promising clinical imaging modality. It penetrates deeper into tissue than OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) and provides a higher resolution than ultrasounds. The PAI is one of the most growing imaging modality and some innovative clinical systems are planned to be on market in 2017. Our study analyzes the different approaches such as photoacoustic computed tomography, 3D photoacoustic microscopy, multispectral photoacoustic tomography and endoscopy with the recent and tremendous technological progress over the past decade: advances in image reconstruction algorithms, laser technology, ultrasound detectors and miniaturization. We analyze which medical domains and applications are the most concerned and explain what should be the forthcoming medical system in the near future. We segment the market in four parts: Components and R&D, pre-clinical, analytics, clinical. We analyzed what should be, quantitatively and qualitatively, the PAI medical markets in each segment and its main trends.

This study introduces a non-invasive phase-filtered differential photoacoustic technique, wavelength-modulated differential photoacoustic radar (WM-DPAR) imaging that addresses this issue by eliminating the effect of the unknown wavelength-dependent fluence. It employs two laser wavelengths modulated out-of-phase to significantly suppress background absorption while amplifying the difference between the two photoacoustic signals. This facilitates pre-malignant tumor identification and hypoxia monitoring, as minute changes in total hemoglobin concentration and hemoglobin oxygenation are detectable. The system can be tuned for specific applications such as cancer screening and SO2 quantification by regulating the amplitude ratio and phase shift of the signal. The WM-DPAR imaging of a head and neck carcinoma tumor grown in the thigh of a nude rat demonstrates the functional PA imaging of small animals in vivo. The PA appearance of the tumor in relation to tumor vascularity is investigated by immunohistochemistry. Phase-filtered WM-DPAR imaging is also illustrated, maximizing quantitative SO2 imaging fidelity of tissues. (Figure presented.)

While ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used as a guidance modality, it often provides insufficient contrast for identifying nerves from surrounding tissues such as tendons. Electrical nerve stimulators can be used in conjunction with US imaging for discriminating nerves from surrounding tissues, but they are insufficient to reliably prevent neural punctures, so that alternative methods are highly desirable. In this study, an interventional multispectral photoacoustic (PA) imaging system was used to directly compare the signal amplitudes and spectra acquired from nerves and tendons ex vivo, for the first time. The results indicate that the system can provide significantly higher image contrast for discriminating nerves and tendons than that provided by US imaging.

Fluorescence and bioluminescence imaging have primarily been used to image infections in animal models, but optical scattering in tissue significantly limits imaging depth and resolution. Photoacoustic imaging, which has improved depth-to-resolution ratio compared to conventional optical imaging, could be useful for visualizing melA-expressing bacteria since melA is a bacterial tyrosinase homologue which produces melanin. Escherichia coli-expressing melA was visibly dark in liquid culture. When melA-expressing bacteria in tubes were imaged with a VisualSonics Vevo LAZR system, the signal-to-noise ratio of a 9× dilution sample was 55, suggesting that ∼20 bacteria cells could be detected with our system. Multispectral (680, 700, 750, 800, 850, and 900 nm) analysis of the photoacoustic signal allowed unmixing of melA-expressing bacteria from blood. To compare photoacoustic reporter gene melA (using Vevo system) with luminescent and fluorescent reporter gene Nano-lantern (using Bruker Xtreme In-Vivo system), tubes of bacteria expressing melA or Nano-lantern were submerged 10 mm in 1% Intralipid, spaced between <1 and 20 mm apart from each other, and imaged with the appropriate imaging modality. Photoacoustic imaging could resolve the two tubes of melA-expressing bacteria even when the tubes were less than 1 mm from each other, while bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging could not resolve the two tubes of Nano-lantern-expressing bacteria even when the tubes were spaced 10 mm from each other. After injecting 100-μL of melA-expressing bacteria in the back flank of a chicken embryo, photoacoustic imaging allowed visualization of melA-expressing bacteria up to 10-mm deep into the embryo. Photoacoustic signal from melA could also be separated from deoxy- and oxy-hemoglobin signal observed within the embryo and chorioallantoic membrane. Our results suggest that melA is a useful photoacoustic reporter gene for visualizing bacteria, and further work incorporating photoacoustic reporters into infectious bacterial strains is warranted. © The Authors.

Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is a volumetric imaging tool to differentiate tissue chromophores and exogenous contrast agents, based on differences in their spectral signatures and used for high-resolution imaging of functional and molecular contrast at centimeter scale depth. We performed MSOT imaging with two- and three-dimensional handheld scanners on 21 Asian patients with NMSC. The tumors and their oxygenation parameters could be distinguished from normal skin endogenously.

The chromophore maps can be obtained by processing several spectral images of skin, e.g., captured by hyperspectral or multispectral cameras during seconds or even minutes. To avoid motion artifacts and simplify the procedure, a single-snapshot technique for mapping melanin, oxyhemoglobin, and deoxyhemoglobin of in-vivo skin by a smartphone under simultaneous three-wavelength (448-532-659 nm) laser illumination is proposed and examined. Three monochromatic spectral images related to the illumination wavelengths were extracted from the smartphone camera RGB image data set with respect to crosstalk between the RGB detection bands. Spectral images were further processed accordingly to Beer's law in a three chromophore approximation. Photon absorption path lengths in skin at the exploited wavelengths were estimated by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The technique was validated clinically on three kinds of skin lesions: nevi, hemangiomas, and seborrheic keratosis. Design of the developed add-on laser illumination system, image-processing details, and the results of clinical measurements are presented and discussed. © 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","SPIE","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Current methods for detection of oral cancer include comprehensive visual examination of the oral cavity, typically followed by tissue biopsy. A noninvasive means to guide the clinician in making a more objective and informed decision toward tissue biopsy can potentially improve the diagnostic yield of this process. To this end, we investigate the potential of fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) for objective detection of oral carcinoma in the hamster cheek pouch model of oral carcinogenesis in vivo. We report that systematically selected FLIM features can differentiate between low-risk (normal, benign and low-grade dysplasia) and high-risk (high-grade dysplasia and cancer) oral lesions with sensitivity and specificity of 87.26% and 93.96%, respectively. We also show the ability of FLIM to generate ""disease"" maps of the tissue which can be used to evaluate relative risk of neoplasia. The results demonstrate the potential of multispectral FLIM with objective image analysis as a noninvasive tool to guide comprehensive oral examination. © 2016 The American Society of Photobiology.","","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Materials and Methods: The study was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. Sequential MSOT was performed in a mouse B16F10 melanoma limb lymph node metastasis model (n = 13) to survey the development of macro-, micro- And in-transit metastases (metastases that are in transit from the primary tumor site to the local nodal basin) in vivo. The in vitro limit of detection was assessed in a B16F10 cell phantom. Signal specificity was determined on the basis of a simultaneous lymphadenitis (n = 4) and 4T1 breast cancer lymph metastasis (n = 2) model. MSOT was compared with intravenous FDG PET/CT. The diagnosis was assessed with histologic examination. Differences in the signal ratio (metastatic node to contralateral limb) between the two modalities were determined with the two-tailed paired t test. Results: The mean signal ratios acquired with MSOT in micrometastases (2.5 ± 0.3, n = 6) and in-transit metastases (8.3 ± 5.8, n = 4) were higher than those obtained with FDG PET/CT (1.1 ± 0.5 [P < .01] and 1.3 ± 0.6 [P > .05], respectively). MSOT was able to help differentiate even small melanoma lymph node metastases from the other lymphadenopathies (P < .05 for both) in vivo, whereas FDG PET/CT could not (P . .1 for both). In vitro, the limit of detection was at an approximate cell density of five cells per microliter (P > .01). Conclusion: MSOT enabled detection of melanoma lymph node micrometastases and in-transit metastases undetectable with FDG PET/CT and helped differentiate melanoma metastasis from other lymphadenopathies. © RSNA, 2016.","Radiological Society of North America Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Currently, surgery is the only treatment that offers a chance of cure, however, accurately identifying tumor margins in real-time is difficult. Research has demonstrated that optical spectroscopy can be used to distinguish between healthy and diseased tissue. The design of a single-pixel imaging system for cancer detection is discussed. The system differentiates between healthy and diseased tissue based on differences in the optical reflectance spectra of these regions. In this study, pancreatic tissue samples from 6 patients undergoing Whipple procedures are imaged with the system (total number of tissue sample imaged was N=11). Regions of healthy and unhealthy tissue are determined based on SAM analysis of these spectral images. Hyperspectral imaging results are then compared to white light imaging and histological analysis. Cancerous regions were clearly visible in the hyperspectral images. Margins determined via spectral imaging were in good agreement with margins identified by histology, indicating that hyperspectral imaging system can differentiate between healthy and diseased tissue. After imaging the system was able to detect cancerous regions with a sensitivity of 74.50±5.89% and a specificity of 75.53±10.81%. Possible applications of this imaging system include determination of tumor margins during surgery/biopsy and assistance with cancer diagnosis and staging. © 2017 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Based on the specific spectral absorption characteristics of different biological tissue, the technology illuminates the tissue with multiple sets of short pulse laser of different wavelengths to produce tissue-specific photoacoustic signal for better photoacoustic imaging and component identification. MSOT combines the high sensitivity and resolution of optical imaging with the ability of the several centimeters deep-tissue imaging by ultrasound imaging, while compensated for the depth limitation of optical imaging and the low contrast of ultrasound imaging. Thus it enables noninvasive real-time imaging in the deep tissue with high-resolution and high-contrast, large penetration depths. Over the last years, MSOT has been applied to detecting the light-absorbing particles within the tumor, evaluating vascular structures and blood oxygenation, imaging the biological fluorescent protein and preliminary studies on the breast cancer patients. With the continuous improvement of photoacoustic imaging system, multispectral photoacoustic imaging technology combined with biomarkers (such as fluorescent reagents, gold particles, etc.) has vast applications in biomedical field, especially to molecular imaging in vivo. In this paper, we gives a brief count of the imaging principle, experimental setup and the performance characteristics of MOST. Furthermore, we mainly summarizes the progress of its latest applications in the biomedical field, particularly in the angiogenesis imaging, early diagnosis of cancer and tumors in situ imaging. © 2015, Editorial Office of Progress in Chemistry.

Examinations of resected tissues from diseased regions such as tumors are crucial procedures during surgical operations to treat cancer. Particularly, if tiny tumors remain at surgical sites after tumor resection, such tumors can result in unwanted outcomes, such as cancer recurrence or metastasis to other organs. To avoid this, accurate characterizations of tumors resected during surgery are necessary. To this end, we devised a multimodal biomicroscopic system including high-frequency ultrasound B-mode, ARFI, and multispectral imaging modalities to examine resected tumors with high levels of accuracy. This system was evaluated with tissue-mimicking phantoms with different mechanical properties. In addition, colorectal tumors excised from cancer patients were examined. The proposed system offers highly resolved anatomical, mechanical, chemical information pertaining to tumors, thus allowing the detection of tumor regions from the surface to deep inside tissues. These results therefore suggest that the multimodal biomicroscopic system has the potential to undertake qualitative characterizations of excised tumors ex vivo. © 2017 The Author(s).","Nature Publishing Group","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Applied to multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), AMF assumes that the spatially-varying tissue spectra follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution, that the spectrum of the target molecule is precisely known and that the molecular target lies in 'low probability' within the data. However, when these assumptions are violated, AMF may result in considerable performance degradation. The objective of this work is to develop a robust statistical detection framework that is appropriately suited to the characteristics of MSOT molecular imaging. Using experimental imaging data, we perform a statistical characterization of MSOT tissue images and conclude to a detector that is based on the t-distribution. More importantly, we introduce a method for estimating the covariance matrix of the background-tissue statistical distribution, which enables robust detection performance independently of the molecular target size or intensity. The performance of the statistical detection framework is assessed through simulations and experimental in vivo measurements and compared to previously used methods. © 2016 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Article","","Scopus"

However, underlying mechanisms of anticancer effects and improved wound healing, in particular plasma associated influence on microcirculation, have not been sufficiently clarified yet. To date, there is no convincing method for monitoring therapy with cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) in vivo. TIVITA™ Tissue System is an innovative hybrid technology that combines imaging and spectroscopy for assessment and documentation of tissue. By collecting spectral information, HSI generates a three-dimensional (3D) data cube that enables calculation of different microcirculation parameters. In this research two patients were treated with CAP in context of head and neck tumor therapy. HSI was able to demonstrate CAP associated effects on microcirculation showing a relevant increase of superficial and deeper cutaneous oxygen saturation, hemoglobin concentration and distribution. This effect may contribute to healing support by CAP in wounds as well as tumor disease. Still in scientific development, HSI appears to be suitable for analyzing and monitoring CAP effects in clinical setting.

Materials and methods: Docetaxel and/or optoacoustic agent-loaded polymeric micelles (with diameters of 22, 48, and 124 nm) were prepared using amphiphilic block copolymers poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether-block-poly (D,L lactide) (PEG                             2000                             –PDLLA                             x                             ).

Results: We found that MSOT imaging offers spatiotemporal and quantitative information on intratumoral distribution of micelles in living animals. All the polymeric micelles rapidly extravasated into tumor site after intravenous injection, but only the 22-nm micelle preferred to distribute into the inner tumor tissues, leading to a superior ATE than that of 48-and 124-nm micelles.

Objective: To develop the next generation of visualization catheters that can reveal irreversible atrial muscle damage caused by ablation and identify viability gaps between the lesions. Methods: Radiofrequency lesions were placed on the endocardial surfaces of excised human and bovine atria and left ventricles of blood perfused rat hearts. Tissue was illuminated with 365nm light and a series of images were acquired from individual spectral bands within 420- 720nm range. By extracting spectral profiles of individual pixels and spectral unmixing, the relative contribution of ablated and unablated spectra to each pixel was then displayed. Results of spectral unmixing were compared to lesion pathology. Results: RF ablation caused significant changes in the tissue autofluorescence profile. The magnitude of these spectral changes in human left atrium was relatively small (> 10% of peak fluorescence value), yet highly significant. Spectral unmixing of hyperspectral datasets enabled high spatial resolution, in-situ delineation of radiofrequency lesion boundaries without the need for exogenous markers. Lesion dimensions derived from hyperspectral imaging approach strongly correlated with histological outcomes. Presence of blood within the myocardium decreased the amplitude of the autofluorescence spectra while having minimal effect on their overall shapes. As a result, the ability of hyperspectral imaging to delineate ablation lesions in vivo was not affected. Conclusions: Hyperspectral imaging greatly increases the contrast between ablated and unablated tissue enabling visualization of viability gaps at clinically relevant locations. Data supports the possibility for developing percutaneous hyperspectral catheters for high-resolution ablation guidance. © 2016 Muselimyan et al.

For instance, inaccurate assumptions in the physical forward model may lead to negative optical absorption values in the reconstructed images. Any artifacts present in the single wavelength optoacoustic images can be significantly aggravated when performing a two-step reconstruction consisting in acoustic inversion and spectral unmixing aimed at rendering the distributions of spectrally distinct absorbers. We investigate a number of algorithmic strategies with non-negativity constraints imposed at the different phases of the reconstruction process. Performance is evaluated in cross-sectional multispectral optoacoustic tomography recordings from tissue-mimicking phantoms and in vivo mice embedded with varying concentrations of contrast agents. Additional in vivo validation is subsequently performed with molecular imaging data involving subcutaneous tumors labeled with genetically expressed iRFP proteins and organ perfusion by optical contrast agents. It is shown that constrained reconstruction is essential for reducing the critical image artifacts associated with inaccurate modeling assumptions. Furthermore, imposing the non-negativity constraint directly on the unmixed distribution of the probe of interest was found to maintain the most robust and accurate reconstruction performance in all experiments. © 2017 EEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In this paper, we present a novel technique for recovering intrinsic MSI measurements from endoscopic RGB images without custom hardware adaptations. The advantage of this approach is that it requires no modification to existing surgical and diagnostic endoscopic imaging systems. Our method uses a radiometric color calibration of the endoscopic camera's sensor in conjunction with a Bayesian framework to recover a per-pixel measurement of the total blood volume (THb) and oxygen saturation (SO2) in the observed tissue. The sensor's pixel measurements are modeled as weighted sums over a mixture of Poisson distributions and we optimize the variables SO2 and THb to maximize the likelihood of the observations. To validate our technique, we use synthetic images generated from Monte Carlo physics simulation of light transport through soft tissue containing sub-surface blood vessels. We also validate our method on in vivo data by comparing it to a MSI dataset acquired with a hardware system that sequentially images multiple spectral bands without overlap. Our results are promising and show that we are able to provide surgeons with additional relevant information by processing endoscopic images with our modeling and inference framework. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

The success of such treatment depends on the extent of tissue damage, where partial lesions can allow abnormal electrical conduction and risk relapse of AF. Proper evaluation of lesion delivery and ablation line continuity remains challenging with current techniques and in part limit procedural efficacy. A tool for direct visualization of endo-myocardial lesions in vivo could potentially reduce ambiguity in treatment location and extent and improve the overall fidelity of lesion sets. In this work, we introduce a method for wide-field visualization of myocardial tissue including the discernment of ablated and non-ablated regions using an endoscopic multispectral imaging system (EMIS). The system was designed to fit the working channel of most commercial sheathes (<4 Fr) and supported quadruple-wavelength reflectance imaging through a flexible fiber-bundle. A total of 50 endocardial lesions were created and imaged on nine swine hearts, ex vivo in addition to 15 lesions on human LA samples near PV regions. A pixel-wise linear discriminant analysis algorithm was developed to classify regions of ablation treatment based on calibrated EMI maps. Results show good agreement of treatment severity and spatial extent compared to post-hoc tissue vital staining. Copyright © 2018 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

The computer-Aided diagnostic approach requires accurate ground truths for both training and validation. This study details a processing pipeline for registering the cancer-normal margin from a digitized histological image to the gross-level HSI of a tissue specimen. Our work incorporates an initial affine and control-point registration followed by a deformable Demons-based registration of the moving mask obtained from the histological image to the fixed mask made from the HS image. To assess registration quality, Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) measures the image overlap, visual inspection is used to evaluate the margin, and average target registration error (TRE) of needle-bored holes measures the registration error between the histologic and HSI images. Excised tissue samples from seventeen patients, 11 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCCa) and 6 thyroid carcinoma, were registered according to the proposed method. Three registered specimens are illustrated in this paper, which demonstrate the efficacy of the registration workflow. Further work is required to apply the technique to more patient data and investigate the ability of this procedure to produce suitable gold standards for machine learning validation. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

It can provide quantitative information relating to global tissue properties associated with structural, metabolic, immunological, and genetic biochemical phenomena in terms of molecular species including amino acids, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acid (DNA). To date in vivo Raman spectroscopy systems mostly included probes and biopsy needles typically limited to single-point tissue interrogation over a scale between 100 and 500 microns. The development of wider field handheld systems could improve tumor localization for a range of open surgery applications including brain, ovarian, and skin cancers. Methods: Here we present a novel Raman spectroscopy implementation using a coherent imaging bundle of fibers to create a probe capable of reconstructing molecular images over mesoscopic fields of view. Detection is performed using linear scanning with a rotation mirror and an imaging spectrometer. Different slits widths were tested at the entrance of the spectrometer to optimize spatial and spectral resolution while preserving sufficient signal-to-noise ratios to detect the principal Raman tissue features. The nonbiological samples, calcite and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), were used to characterize the performance of the system. The new wide-field probe was tested on ex vivo samples of calf brain and swine tissue. Raman spectral content of both tissue types were validated with data from the literature and compared with data acquired with a single-point Raman spectroscopy probe. The single-point probe was used as the gold standard against which the new instrument was benchmarked as it has already been thoroughly validated for biological tissue characterization. Result: We have developed and characterized a practical noncontact handheld Raman imager providing tissue information at a spatial resolution of 115 microns over a field of view >14 mm2 and a spectral resolution of 6 cm-1 over the whole fingerprint region. Typical integration time to acquire an entire Raman image over swine tissue was set to approximately 100 s. Spectra acquired with both probes (single-point and wide-field) showed good agreement, with a Pearson correlation factor >0.85 over different tissue categories. Protein and lipid content of imaged tissue were manifested into the measured spectra which correlated well with previous findings in the literature. An example of quantitative molecular map is presented for swine tissue and calf brain based on the ratio of protein-to-lipid content showing clear delineations between white and gray matter as well as between adipose and muscle tissue. Conclusion: We presented the development of a Raman imaging probe with a field of view of a few millimeters and a spatial resolution consistent with standard surgical imaging methods using an imaging bundle. Spectra acquired with the newly developed system on swine tissue and calf brain correlated well with an establish single-point probe and observed spectral features agreed with previous finding in the literature. The imaging probe has demonstrated its ability to reconstruct molecular images of soft tissues. The approach presented here has a lot of potential for the development of surgical Raman imaging probe to guide the surgeon during cancer surgery. © 2017 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","Article","","Scopus"

Working with hyperspectral images in vivo, however, is not straightforward as the high dimensionality of the data makes real-time processing challenging. In this paper, a novel dimensionality reduction scheme and a new processing pipeline are introduced to obtain a detailed tumor classification map for intra-operative margin definition during brain surgery. However, existing approaches to dimensionality reduction based on manifold embedding can be time consuming and may not guarantee a consistent result, thus hindering final tissue classification. The proposed framework aims to overcome these problems through a process divided into two steps: dimensionality reduction based on an extension of the T-distributed stochastic neighbor approach is first performed and then a semantic segmentation technique is applied to the embedded results by using a Semantic Texton Forest for tissue classification. Detailed in vivo validation of the proposed method has been performed to demonstrate the potential clinical value of the system. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Here, we develop a new approach for “barcoding” nanoparticles composed of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) with bright, spectrally defined quantum dots (QDs) to enable direct, fluorescent detection of nanoparticle fate with subcellular resolution. We show that QD labeling does not affect major biophysical properties of nanoparticles or their interaction with cells and tissues. Live cell imaging enabled simultaneous visualization of the interaction of control and targeted nanoparticles with bEnd.3 cells in a flow chamber, providing direct evidence that surface modification of nanoparticles with the cell-penetrating peptide TAT increases their biophysical association with cell surfaces over very short time periods under convective current. We next developed this technique for quantitative biodistribution analysis in vivo. These studies demonstrate that nanoparticle surface modification with the cell penetrating peptide TAT facilitates brain-specific delivery that is restricted to brain vasculature. Although nanoparticle entry into the healthy brain parenchyma is minimal, with no evidence for movement of nanoparticles across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), we observed that nanoparticles are able to enter to the central nervous system (CNS) through regions of altered BBB permeability – for example, into circumventricular organs in the brain or leaky vasculature of late-stage intracranial tumors.

Gold nanorods are the first choice of materials for NIR-mediated photothermal therapy due to their strong localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) at NIR region. Similarly, gadolinium based MRI contrast agents have an ability to increase the ionic and molecular relaxivity, thereby enhancing the solvent proton relaxation rate resulting in contrast enhancement. Herein, the effort has been made to engineer a dual front theranostic agent with combined photothermal and magnetic resonance imaging capacity using gadolinium tethered gold nanorods (Gd3+-AuNR). NIR-responsive gold nanorods were surface fabricated by means of Au-thiol interaction using a thiolated macrocyclic chelator that chelates Gd3+ ions, and further stabilized by thiolated polyethylene glycol (PEG-SH). The magnetic properties of the Gd3+-AuNR displayed an enhanced r1 relaxivity of 12.1 mM-1s-1, with higher biological stability, and contrast enhancement in both solution state and in cell pellets. In-vitro (cell-free) and ex-vivo (on pig skin) analysis of the Gd3+-AuNR shows enhanced photothermal properties as equivalent to that of the raw AuNR. Furthermore, Gd3+-AuNR showed competent cellular entry and intracellular distribution as revealed by hyperspectral microscopy. In addition, Gd3+-AuNR also exhibits significant thermal ablation of B16-F10 cells in the presence of NIR. Thus, Gd3+-AuNR features a significant theranostic potential with combined photothermal and imaging modality, suggesting a great potential in anticancer therapy.

Reference spectral libraries (RSLs) contain hyperspectral data collected from materials of known composition and are used to detect the known materials in experimental samples through a one-to-one pixel “mapping” process. In some HSI studies, RSLs created from raw NPs were used to map NPs in experimental samples in a different matrix; for example, RSLs created from NPs in suspension to map NPs in biological tissue. Others have utilized RSLs created from NPs in the same matrix. However, few studies have systematically compared hyperspectral data as a function of the matrix in which the NPs are found and its impact on mapping results. The objective of this study is to compare RSLs created from metal oxide NPs in aqueous suspensions to RSLs created from the same NPs in rat tissues following in vivo inhalation exposure, and to investigate the differences in mapping that result from the use of each RSL. Results demonstrate that the spectral profiles of these NPs are matrix dependent: RSLs created from NPs in positive control tissues mapped to experimental tissues more appropriately than RSLs created from NPs in suspension. Aqueous suspension RSLs mapped 0-602 out of 500,424 pixels per tissue image while tissue RSLs mapped 689-18,435 pixels for the same images. This study underscores the need for appropriate positive controls for the creation of RSLs for mapping NPs in experimental samples. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Wiley-Liss Inc.","Article","","Scopus"

Methods: In this paper, we describe a noninvasive diagnosis method with a hyperspectral imager for detection and location of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) at multiple scales. At the macroscopic level, the hyperspectral imager was applied to capture the reflectance images of the entire cervix in vivo at a series of wavelengths. At the microscopic level, the hyperspectral imager was coupled with a microscope to collect the transmittance images of the pathological slide. The collected image data were calibrated. A wide-gap second derivative analysis was applied to differentiate CIN from other types of tissue. Results: At both macroscopic and microscopic levels, hyperspectral imaging analysis results were consistent with those of histopathological analysis, indicating the technical feasibility of multi-scale hyperspectral imaging for cervical neoplasia detection with accuracy and efficacy. Conclusion: We propose a multi-scale hyperspectral imaging method for noninvasive detection of cervical neoplasia. Comparison of the imaging results with those of gold standard histologic measurements demonstrates that the hyperspectral diagnostic imaging system can distinguish CIN at both tissue and cellular levels. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Springer Verlag","Article","","Scopus"

Optical sensing is commonly applied for assessing oxygen saturation but is often restricted to local measurements or else it requires spectral and spatial information at the expense of time. Many methods proposed so far require assumptions on the properties of measured tissue. In this study we investigated a computational method that uses only multispectral information and quantitatively computes tissue oxygen saturation independently of tissue optical properties. The method is based on linear transformations of measurements in three isosbestic points. We investigated the ideal isosbestic point combination out of six isosbestic points available for measurement in the visible and near-infrared region that enable accurate oxygen saturation computation. We demonstrate this method on controlled tissue mimicking phantoms having different optical properties and validated the measurements using a gas analyzer. A mean error of 2.9 ± 2.8% O2Sat was achieved. Finally, we performed pilot studies in tissues in-vivo by measuring dynamic changes in fingers subjected to vascular occlusion, the vasculature of mouse ears and exposed mouse organs. Selected steps of spectral transformations applied to oxygenation spectra. The original reflectance spectrum M(λ) is transformed in step 1 to overlap with reference spectra (grey) in three isosbestic points, resulting in M″(λ). In step 2, the gradient of M″(λ) is computed resulting in M″grad(λ), which can be used for quantitative oxygenation computation. This paper proposes a new methodology using optical imaging technology for accurate detection of blood oxygenation. Low oxygen saturation values of blood often result from or can be the cause of a variety of diseases, like different types of cancer or diabetes. Accurate blood oxygenation monitoring is therefore crucial and optical imaging offer the possibility of early, rapid and noninvasive detection of malfunctions of the body. © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, its imaging contrast and depth are limited by the turbid skull. Tissue optical clearing has a great potential for solving this problem. Our goal was to develop a transparent skull window, without performing a craniotomy, for use in assessing cerebrovascular structure and function. Methods: Skull optical clearing agents were topically applied to the skulls of mice to create a transparent window within 15 min. The clearing efficacy, repeatability, and safety of the skull window were then investigated. Results: Imaging through the optical clearing skull window enhanced both the contrast and the depth of intravital imaging. The skull window could be used on 2-8-month-old mice and could be expanded from regional to bi-hemispheric. In addition, the window could be repeatedly established without inducing observable inflammation and metabolic toxicity. Conclusion: We successfully developed an easy-to-handle, large, switchable, and safe optical clearing skull window. Combined with various optical imaging techniques, cerebrovascular structure and function can be observed through this optical clearing skull window. Thus, it has the potential for use in basic research on the physiopathologic processes of cortical vessels. © Ivyspring International Publisher.","Ivyspring International Publisher","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Theory and Methods: The susceptibility map of signal-void regions is estimated from MSI B0 field maps using total variation (TV) regularized inversion. Voxels with susceptibility estimates above a predetermined threshold are identified as metal. The accuracy of the estimated susceptibility and implant geometry was evaluated in simulations, phantom, and in vivo experiments. Results: The proposed method provided more accurate susceptibility estimation compared with a previous method without TV regularization, in both simulations and phantom experiments. In the phantom experiment where the actual implant was 40% of the signal-void region, the mean estimated susceptibility was close to the susceptibility in literature, and the precision and recall of the estimated geometry was 85% and 93%. In vivo studies in subjects with hip implants also demonstrated that the proposed method can distinguish implants from surrounding low-signal tissues, such as cortical bone. Conclusion: The proposed method can improve the delineation of metallic implant geometry by distinguishing metal voxels from artificial signal voids and low-signal tissues by estimating the susceptibility maps.

The ability to accurately measure melanin distribution at different depths and to distinguish it from hemoglobin is clearly important when assessing pigmented lesions (benign versus malignant). We have developed a multimode hyperspectral dermoscope (SkinSpect™) able to more accurately image both melanin and hemoglobin distribution in skin. SkinSpect uses both hyperspectral and polarization-sensitive measurements. SkinSpect's higher accuracy has been obtained by correcting for the effect of melanin absorption on hemoglobin absorption in measurements of melanocytic nevi. In vivo human skin pigmented nevi (N=20) were evaluated with the SkinSpect, and measured melanin and hemoglobin concentrations were compared with spatial frequency domain spectroscopy (SFDS) measurements. We confirm that both systems show low correlation of hemoglobin concentrations with regions containing different melanin concentrations (R=0.13 for SFDS, R=0.07 for SkinSpect). © 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","SPIE","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

ONBs were proposed as promising contrast-generating imaging agents due to their strong light scattering generated from nonuniformity of refractive index at the interface. With this powerful platform, we have revealed the trajectories and quantities of ONBs in cells, and demonstrated the relation between the size and diffusion coefficient. We have also evaluated the presence of ONBs in the nucleus with respect to an increase in incubation time and have quantified the uptake in single cells in ex vivo tumor tissues.

In this paper, we use a triangular geometric mesh model in order to combine the advantages of both feature and intensity information and track the tissue surface reliably and robustly. Results: Synthetic and in vivo experiments are performed to provide quantitative analysis of the tracking accuracy of our method, and we also show exemplar results for registering multispectral images where there is only a weak image signal.

A new approach for generating the HSI ground truth using a registered histological cancer margin is applied in order to create a validation dataset.

Animal models of exposure are valuable for assessing potential toxicity and adverse health effects. This study presents a method to determine relative quantitation of nanoparticle (NP) abundance in histological samples in an ex vivo model of cutaneous exposure to metal oxide NPs using enhanced darkfield microscopy (EDFM) with hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and mapping. Porcine skin tissue was topically exposed to alumina, ceria, and silica NPs using a modified Franz diffusion chamber and histologically prepared for imaging. EDFM allowed for rapid direct visualization of NPs, while hyperspectral mapping confirmed the composition of NPs throughout the tissue, based on positive matching of pixels to reference spectral libraries (RSLs). Relative quantitation of NPs was achieved based on calculating the percentage of mapped pixels per field of view (FOV). The greatest abundance of mapped NPs was found in the ceria-exposed group regardless of tissue layer, relative to the other groups. Fewer NPs were found in the dermis compared to the stratum corneum in both the alumina- and ceria-exposed groups. This study demonstrated EDFM-HSI as a valuable method to determine relative quantitation of NPs in histological samples.

The spectral profile of near infrared excitation light used in optoacoustic tomography instruments is modified by absorption and scattering as it propagates deep into biological tissue. The resulting images therefore provide only qualitative insight into the distribution of tissue chromophores. Knowledge of the spectral profile of excitation light across the mouse is needed for accurate determination of the absorption coefficient in vivo. Under the conditions of constant Grueneisen parameter and accurate knowledge of the light fluence, a linear relationship should exist between the initial optoacoustic pressure amplitude and the tissue absorption coefficient. Using data from a commercial optoacoustic tomography system, we implemented an iterative optimization based on the σ-Eddington approximation to the Radiative Transfer Equation to derive a light fluence map within a given object. We segmented the images based on the positions of phantom inclusions, or mouse organs, and used known scattering coefficients for initialization. Performing the fluence correction in simple phantoms allowed the expected linear relationship between recorded and independently measured absorption coefficients to be retrieved and spectral coloring to be compensated. For in vivo data, the correction resulted in an enhancement of signal intensities in deep tissues. This improved our ability to visualize organs at depth (> 5mm). Future work will aim to perform the optimization without data normalization and explore the need for methodology that enables routine implementation for in vivo imaging. © 2016 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

In particular, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression has been shown to have both prognostic and predictive values. Recently, an increasingly more complex view of HER2 in breast cancer has emerged from genome sequencing that highlights the role of inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity in therapy resistance. Studies on such heterogeneity demand high-content, high-resolution functional and molecular imaging in vivo, which cannot be achieved using any single imaging tool. Clearly, there is a critical need to develop a multimodality approach for breast cancer imaging. Since 2006, grating-based x-ray imaging has been developed for much-improved x-ray images. In 2014, the demonstration of fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) guided by x-ray grating-based micro-CT was reported with encouraging results and major drawbacks. In this paper, we propose to integrate grating-based x-ray tomography (GXT) and high-dimensional optical tomography (HOT) into the first-of-its-kind truly-fused GXT-HOT (pronounced as ""Get Hot"") system for imaging of breast tumor heterogeneity, HER2 expression and dimerization, and therapeutic response. The primary innovation lies in developing a brand-new high-content, high-throughput x-ray optical imager based on several contemporary techniques to have MRI-type soft tissue contrast, PET-like sensitivity and specificity, and micro-CT-equivalent resolution. This system consists of two orthogonal x-ray Talbot-Lau interferometric imaging chains and a hyperspectral time-resolved single-pixel optical imager. Both the system design and pilot results will be reported in this paper, along with relevant issues under further investigation. © Copyright 2016 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Methods: 12 healthy volunteers were recruited under an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocol. Fundus images were taken with a custom hyperspectral camera with a spectral range of 460–630 nm. We determined retinal vascular oxygen saturation (sO2) for the healthy population using the captured spectra by least squares curve fitting. Additionally, macular pigment optical density was localized and visualized using multispectral reflectometry from selected wavelengths. Results: We successfully determined the mean sO2 of arteries and veins of each subject (ages 21–80) with excellent intrasubject repeatability (1.4% standard deviation). The mean arterial sO2 for all subjects was 90.9% ± 2.5%, whereas the mean venous sO2 for all subjects was 64.5% ± 3.5%. The mean artery–vein (A–V) difference in sO2 varied between 20.5% and 31.9%. In addition, we were able to reveal and quantify macular pigment optical density. Conclusions: We demonstrated a single imaging tool capable of oxygen saturation and macular pigment density measurements in vivo. The unique combination of broad spectral range, high spectral–spatial resolution, rapid and robust imaging capability, and compact design make this system a valuable tool for multifunction spectral imaging that can be easily performed in a clinic setting. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Taylor and Francis Ltd","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

DA-OCT offers a 100-fold speed increase compared with its predecessor, multispectral multiple-scattering low coherence interferometry (ms2/LCI), by using a new beam scanning mechanism based on a microelectro-mechanical system (MEMS) mirror. The data acquisition scheme was altered to take advantage of this scanning speed, producing tomographic images at a rate of 4 frames (B-scans) per second. DA-OCT differs from ms2/LCI in that the dual axes intersect at a shallower depth (∼1 mm). This difference, coupled with the faster scanning speed, shifts the detection priority from multiply scattered to ballistic light. The utility of this approach was demonstrated by imaging both ex vivo porcine ear skin and in vivo rat skin from a McFarlane flap model. The enhanced penetration depth provided by the DA-OCT system will be beneficial to various clinical applications in dermatology and surgery. © 2017 Optical Society of America","OSA - The Optical Society","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In this study, we investigate the combined roles of liposome size and surface charge on the effectiveness of delivery to gliomas after intraarterial injection. Intracarotid injection of liposomes was performed in separate cohorts of both healthy and C6 glioma-bearing Sprague Dawley rats after induction of transient cerebral hypoperfusion. Large (200 nm) and small (60–80 nm) fluorescent dye-loaded liposomes that were either cationic or neutral in surface charge were utilized. Delivery effectiveness was quantitatively measured both with real-time, in vivo and postmortem diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Semi-quantitative multispectral fluorescence imaging was also utilized to assess the pattern and extent of liposome targeting within tumors. Large cationic liposomes demonstrated the most effective hemispheric and glioma targeting of all the liposomes tested. Selective large cationic liposome retention at the site of glioma growth was observed. The liposome deposition pattern within tumors after intraarterial injection was variable with both core penetration and peripheral deposition observed in specific tumors. This study provides evidence that liposome size and charge are important determinants of effective brain and glioma targeting after intraarterial injection.

Our spectral imaging system uses autofluorescencent emission from collagen (400 nm) and NAD(P)H (475 nm), as well as, differences in the optical reflectance spectra as diagnostics for differentiating between healthy and diseased tissue. In this study, we demonstrate the ability of our imaging system to discriminate between healthy and damaged porcine epidermal tissue. Healthy porcine epidermal tissue samples (n=11) were imaged ex vivo using our hyperspectral system. The amount of NAD(P)H emission and the reflectance properties were approximately constant across the surface of healthy tissue samples. The tissue samples were then thermally damaged using an 1850 nm thulium fiber laser and re-imaged after laser irradiation. The damaged regions were clearly visible in the hyperspectral images as the thermal damage altered the fluorescent emission of NAD(P)H and changed the scattering properties of the tissue. The extent of the damaged regions was determined based on the hyperspectral images and these estimates were compared to damage extents measured in white light images acquired with a traditional camera. The extent of damage determined via hyperspectral imaging was in good agreement with estimates based on white light imaging indicating that our system is capable of differentiating between healthy and damaged tissue. Possible applications of our single pixel hyperspectral imaging system range from real-Time determination of tumor margins during surgery to the use of this technique in the pathology lab to aid with cancer diagnosis and staging. © 2016 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

The research indicated several potential, high impact routes towards point of care application. Our current studies take the first steps to empirical assessment and practical implementation of the technology. The initial study was performed entirely with interrogating probes applied in transmission mode i.e. bones were illuminated from one side and signals measured from the opposite side. This has some disadvantages that would be overcome were reflection mode (probe and detector on same side) employed. Further, recent advances in detector technology have resulted in the first commercially available hyperspectral X-ray imaging system that has the promise of faster, lower dose imaging. Thus this pilot study involves the creation of unique, high impact data with the potential to form the basis of a new generation of medical diagnostic instrumentation. We present the findings from our initial examination of ex vivo tissues. A systematic series of conventional reflection mode experiments were performed in which bone specimens were examined through increasing thicknesses of overlaying muscle/fat/skin. This data provided an indication of parameter precision associated with the biomarkers that were used in subsequent phases. Further, we have applied a new imaging modality (focal construct technology, FCT) to these geometries. FCT is a new approach to data collection using hollow X-ray beams and this was applied in reflection mode to measure bone mineral signatures. This had not previously been attempted and required some initial modelling to ensure correct topologies of the hollow beams. The speed/dose advantage of FCT was evaluated.","TechConnect","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Herein, we developed a contrast agent that can very effectively combine multiscale PAI with MSPAI for a more comprehensive characterization of complex biological tissues. Specifically, we developed novel PIID-DTBT based semi-conducting polymer dots (Pdots) that show broad and strong optical absorption in the visible-light region (500–700 nm). The performances of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) and gold nanorods (GNRs), which have been verified as excellent photoacoustic contrast agents, were compared with that of the Pdots based on the multiscale PAI system. Both ex vivo and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the Pdots have better photoacoustic conversion efficiency at 532 nm than GNPs and showed similar photoacoustic performance with GNRs at 700 nm at the same mass concentration. Photostability and toxicity tests demonstrated that the Pdots are photostable and biocompatible. More importantly, an in vivo MSPAI experiment indicated that the Pdots have better photoacoustic performance than the blood and therefore the signals can be accurately extracted from the background of vascular-rich tissues. Our work demonstrates the great potential of Pdots as highly effective contrast agents for the precise localization of lesions relative to the blood vessels based on multiscale PAI and MSPAI.

In order to be informative, this label-free method requires careful multispectral or hyperspectral recording of autofluorescence images followed by unsupervised extraction (unmixing) of biochemical signatures. The unmixing is difficult due to the scarcity of biochemically pure regions in cells and also because autofluorescence is weak compared with signals from labelled cells, typically leading to low signal to noise ratio. Here, we solve the problem of unsupervised hyperspectral unmixing of cellular autofluorescence by introducing the Robust Dependent Component Analysis (RoDECA). This approach provides sophisticated and statistically robust quantitative biochemical analysis of cellular autofluorescence images. We validate our method on artificial images, where the addition of varying known level of noise has allowed us to quantify the accuracy of our RoDECA analysis in a way that can be applied to real biological datasets. The same unsupervised statistical minimisation is then applied to imaging of mouse retinal photoreceptor cells where we establish the identity of key endogenous fluorophores (free NADH, FAD and lipofuscin) and derive the corresponding molecular abundance maps. The pre-processing methodology of image datasets is also presented, which is essential for the spectral unmixing analysis, but mostly overlooked in the previous studies. © 2017 The Author(s).","Nature Publishing Group","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) facilitates the detection of both spatial and spectral information in a single data acquisition, however, instrumentation for HSI is typically complex, bulky and expensive. We sought to overcome these limitations using a novel robust and low cost HSI camera based on a spectrally resolved detector array (SRDA). We integrated this HSI camera into a wide-field reflectance-based imaging system operating in the near-infrared range to assess the suitability for in vivo imaging of exogenous fluorescent contrast agents. Using this fluorescence HSI (fHSI) system, we were able to accurately resolve the presence and concentration of at least 7 fluorescent dyes in solution. We also demonstrate high spectral unmixing precision, signal linearity with dye concentration and at depth in tissue mimicking phantoms, and delineate 4 fluorescent dyes in vivo. Our approach, including statistical background removal, could be directly generalised to broader spectral ranges, for example, to resolve tissue reflectance or autofluorescence and in future be tailored to video rate applications requiring snapshot HSI data acquisition. © 2017 The Authors.

We introduced and tested a multiview hyperspectral imaging technique for noninvasive topographic imaging of cutaneous wound oxygenation. The technique integrated a multiview module and a hyperspectral module in a single portable unit. Four plane mirrors were cohered to form a multiview reflective mirror set with a rectangular cross section. The mirror set was placed between a hyperspectral camera and the target biological tissue. For a single image acquisition task, a hyperspectral data cube with five views was obtained. The five-view hyperspectral image consisted of a main objective image and four reflective images. Three-dimensional (3-D) topography of the scene was achieved by correlating the matching pixels between the objective image and the reflective images. 3-D mapping of tissue oxygenation was achieved using a hyperspectral oxygenation algorithm. The multiview hyperspectral imaging technique was validated in a wound model, a tissue-simulating blood phantom, and in vivo biological tissue. The experimental results demonstrated the technical feasibility of using multiview hyperspectral imaging for 3-D topography of tissue functional properties. © 2016 The Authors.

It is thus necessary to rationally design inorganic nanomaterials with proper accumulation and clearance mechanism in vivo. Herein, we prepared ultrasmall Cu3BiS3 nanodots (NDs) as a single-phased ternary bimetal sulfide for photothermal cancer therapy guided by multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) and X-ray computed tomography (CT) due to bismuthas excellent X-ray attenuation coefficient. We then monitored and investigated their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. We also used CT imaging to demonstrate that Cu3BiS3 NDs can be quickly removed through renal clearance, which may be related to their small size, rapid chemical transformation, and degradation in an acidic lysosomal environment as characterized by synchrotron radiation-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy. These results reveal that Cu3BiS3 NDs act as a simple but powerful ""theranostic"" nanoplatform for MSOT/CT imaging-guided tumor ablation with excellent metabolism and rapid clearance that will improve safety for clinical applications in the future. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","American Chemical Society","Article","","Scopus"

The deoxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, and MMP signals were coregistered with structural magnetic resonance imaging data. The ipsi-/contralateral ratio of tissue oxygen saturation (SO2) was significantly reduced during 1 h of tMCAO and recovered after 48 h of reperfusion in tMCAO compared with sham-operated mice (n = 8 to 10 per group). A higher ipsi-/contralateral MMP signal ratio was detected at 48 h after reperfusion in the lesioned brain regions of tMCAO compared with the sham-operated animal (n = 4 to 6 per group). Ex vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging of MMP signal in brain slices was used to validate in vivo MSOT measurements.

Moreover, the biological effects of such low levels of translocation are unclear. We employed a nano-scale hyperspectral microscope to spatially observe and spectrally profile NPs in tissues and blood following pulmonary deposition in mice. In addition, we characterized effects occurring in blood, liver and heart at the mRNA and protein level following translocation from the lungs. Adult female C57BL/6 mice were exposed via intratracheal instillation to 18 or 162 μg of industrially relevant titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nano-TiO2) alongside vehicle controls. Using the nano-scale hyperspectral microscope, translocation to heart and liver was confirmed at both doses, and to blood at the highest dose, in mice analyzed 24 h post-exposure. Global gene expression profiling and ELISA analysis revealed activation of complement cascade and inflammatory processes in heart and specific activation of complement factor 3 in blood, suggesting activation of an early innate immune response essential for particle opsonisation and clearance. The liver showed a subtle response with changes in the expression of genes associated with acute phase response. This study characterizes the subtle systemic effects that occur in liver and heart tissues following pulmonary exposure and low levels of translocation of nano-TiO2 from lungs. © 2015 Crown Copyright.

Finally, these bands were assigned to be the color components of an enhanced image of the object.

A high tumour-to-background (T/B) ratio is crucial for successful imaging, which strongly depends on tumour-specific probes that rapidly accumulate in the tumour, while non-bound probes are rapidly cleared. Here, using pre-invasive breast cancer as a model, we investigate whether the use of combinations of probes with different target specificities results in higher T/B ratios and whether dual-spectral imaging leads to improvements in tumour characterization. Methods: We performed optical molecular imaging of an orthotopic breast cancer model mimicking ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). A combination of carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)- and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-specific variable domains of the heavy chain from heavy-chain antibodies (VHHs) was conjugated either to the same fluorophore (IRDye800CW) to evaluate T/B ratios or to different fluorophores (IRDye800CW, IRDye680RD or IRDye700DX) to analyse the expression of CAIX and HER2 simultaneously through dual-fluorescence detection. These experiments were performed non-invasively in vivo, in a mimicked intra-operative setting, and ex vivo on tumour sections. Results: Application of the CAIX- and HER2-specific VHH combination resulted in an increase of the T/B ratio, as compared to T/B ratios obtained from each of these single VHHs together with an irrelevant VHH. This dual tumour marker-specific VHH combination also enabled the detection of small metastases in the lung. Furthermore, dual-spectral imaging enabled the assessment of the expression status of both CAIX and HER2 in a mimicked intra-operative setting, as well as on tumour sections, which was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Conclusions: These results establish the feasibility of the use of VHH ‘cocktails’ to increase T/B ratios and improve early detection of heterogeneous tumours and the use of multispectral molecular imaging to facilitate the assessment of the target expression status of tumours and metastases, both invasive or non-invasively. © 2016, Kijanka et al.","Springer Verlag","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Due to the broad absorption in the near-infrared range, Au-Fe2C JNPs showed a significant photothermal effect with a 30.2% calculated photothermal transduction efficiency under 808 nm laser irradiation in vitro.

We found that Au-Fe2C JNPs conjugated with the affibody (Au-Fe2C-ZHER2:342) have more accumulation and deeper penetration in tumor sites than nontargeting JNPs (Au-Fe2C-PEG) in vivo. Meanwhile, our results verified that Au-Fe2C-ZHER2:342 JNPs can selectively target tumor cells with low cytotoxicity and ablate tumor tissues effectively in a mouse model. In summary, monodisperse Au-Fe2C JNPs, used as a multifunctional nanoplatform, allow the combination of multiple-model imaging techniques and high therapeutic efficacy and have great potential for precision theranostic nanomedicines. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","American Chemical Society","Article","","Scopus"

In this method, diffuse reflectance images of in vivo cortical tissue are acquired at nine wavelengths (500, 520, 540, 560, 570, 580, 600, 730, and 760 nm). A multiple regression analysis aided by the Monte Carlo simulation for the absorbance spectra is then utilized to estimate the optical coefficients of cortical tissue. This analysis calculates the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin and that of deoxygenated hemoglobin, the scattering amplitude a and the scattering power b. The spectrum of absorption coefficient is deduced from the estimated concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin. The spectrum of reduced scattering coefficient is determined by the estimated scattering amplitude and scattering power. The particle size distribution of microstructure is calculated from the estimated scattering power b for evaluating the morphological change in brain tissue quantitatively. Animal experiments with in vivo exposed brain of rats demonstrated that the responses of the absorption properties to hyperoxic and anoxic conditions are in agreement with the expected well-known cortical hemodynamics. The average particle size was significantly reduced immediately after the onset of anoxia and then it was changed into an increase, which implied the swelling and shrinkage of the cellular and subcellular structures induced by loss of tissue viability in brain tissue. © Society for Applied Spectroscopy.","SAGE Publications Inc.","Article","","Scopus"

To aid the surgeons’ eye, a camera system enabling parathyroid-specific image enhancement would be useful. Hyperspectral camera technology might work, provided that the spectral signature of parathyroid tissue offers enough specific features to be reliably and automatically distinguished from surrounding tissues. As a first step to investigate this, we examined the feasibility of wide band diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) for automated spectroscopic tissue classification, using silicon (Si) and indium-gallium-arsenide (InGaAs) sensors. Methods: DRS (350–1830 nm) was performed during (para-)thyroid resections. From the acquired spectra 36 features at predefined wavelengths were extracted. The best features for classification of parathyroid from adipose or thyroid were assessed by binary logistic regression for Si- and InGaAs-sensor ranges. Classification performance was evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation. Results: In 19 patients 299 spectra were recorded (62 tissue sites: thyroid = 23, parathyroid = 21, adipose = 18). Classification accuracy of parathyroid–adipose was, respectively, 79% (Si), 82% (InGaAs) and 97% (Si/InGaAs combined). Parathyroid–thyroid classification accuracies were 80% (Si), 75% (InGaAs), 82% (Si/InGaAs combined). Conclusions: Si and InGaAs sensors are fairly accurate for automated spectroscopic classification of parathyroid, adipose and thyroid tissues. Combination of both sensor technologies improves accuracy. Follow-up research, aimed towards hyperspectral imaging seems justified. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Optical diagnostics methods allow to obtain data on skin's structure and composition,to examine biotissue processes without any negative impact on skin. Polarization diagnostics methods are very perspective. They are of interest due to biotissue-scattered optical fields polarization characteristics' high sensitivity to the structural features and physiological status of the study object. Implementation of quantitative ellipsometry in turbid media eventually can provide qualitatively new results with studies of the tissue's morphological and functional state which relate to the most important directions of today medical diagnostics. As a result development of theoretical and practical aspects of optically heterogeneous biological structures and polarized radiation interaction while solving the tasks of non-invasive rapid medical objects' state control is considered to be of current interest for improving of skin formation detection quality. The purpose of this study is to develop a stand for in vivo skin state examination by scattering ellipsometry with a help of studying of anisotropic skin environment influence on the polarization state evolution of the radiation propagating in this skin.The possibility of implementation the method of quantitative ellipsometry for in vivo skin's optical anisotropy and structural heterogeneity studies is shown. The Mueller matrix algebra is used for describing polarization properties of the depolarizing opticallyactive biotissue medium. A setup for recording the polarization state of the backscattered radiation was designed based on a comparative analysis of the technical options and their application in experiments with biotissue. To have a uniform intensity distribution along the cross section of the input radiation beam, and also to form the polarization states necessary for the study, using the emitting channel of the LEF-3 ellipsometer in the optical scheme of the stand is proposed. The choice of the radiation source wavelength in the spectral range (He-Ne laser, 632 nm) is justified, in which radiation scattering in turbid biological media predominates over absorption, which makes it possible to tell about the sample structural parameters by changing output radiation polarization state. The receiving channel of the output polarization state analyzer was designed, which contains based on a color matrix sensor with a unified analysis field video information block, that allows further multispectral studying of the skin surface structure. The method of a skin ellipsometric examination based on the distribution visualization of the polarization state parameters along the cross section of the output radiation beam and on its subsequent analysis is proposed. For image processing and calculation of the sample polarization characteristics an algorithm and software are developed with a Python language. In the backscattering mode of probing laser radiation the distributions of the skin sector containing scar structures polarization characteristics are obtained. © 2018 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

We have previously presented a miniaturised structured light (SL) system for recovery of tissue surface shape in minimally invasive surgery (MIS), based on a flexible multispectral structured illumination probe (1.9 mm diameter) (Clancy et al. in Biomed Opt Express 2(11):3119–3128, 2011. doi:10.1364/BOE.2.003119). This paper reports further hardware and analytical developments to improve the light pattern decoding result and increase the reconstruction accuracy. Methods: The feasibility of using an 8-band multispectral camera with higher pattern-colour discrimination ability than normal RGB camera in this system was studied. Additionally, the “normalised cut” algorithm was investigated to improve pattern segmentation. Results: The whole SL system was evaluated by phantom and in vivo experiments. Higher pattern identification performance than that of an RGB camera was recorded by using the multispectral camera (average precision >97 %, average sensitivity >62 %). An average of 0.67mm reconstruction error was achieved using the proposed pattern decoding method on a heart phantom at a working distance of approximately 10 cm. Conclusions: The experiment showed the superiority of the multispectral camera over the RGB camera in the spot identification step. The proposed pattern decoding algorithm underwent evaluations using different experiments, showing that it provided promising reconstruction results. The potential of using this system in MIS environments has been demonstrated. © 2015, CARS.","Springer Verlag","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Materials and methods: Twenty-three patients with 30–70 % stenosis underwent two 3T MR carotid vessel wall exams within a 1 month interval. T1w, T2w, PDw and TOF images were acquired around the region of maximum vessel narrowing. Manual delineation of the vessel wall and plaque components (lipid, calcification, loose matrix) by an experienced observer provided the reference standard for training and evaluation of an automated plaque classifier. Areas of different plaque components and fibrous tissue were quantified and compared between segmentation methods and scan sessions. Results: In total, 304 slices from 23 patients were included in the segmentation experiment, in which 144 aligned slice pairs were available for repeatability analysis. The correlation between manual and automated segmented areas was 0.35 for lipid, 0.66 for calcification, 0.50 for loose matrix and 0.82 for fibrous tissue. For the comparison between scan sessions, the coefficient of repeatability of area measurement obtained by automated segmentation was lower than by manual delineation for lipid (9.9 vs. 17.1 mm2), loose matrix (13.8 vs. 21.2 mm2) and fibrous tissue (24.6 vs. 35.0 mm2), and was similar for calcification (20.0 vs. 17.6 mm2).

Long-term mortality from uveal melanoma, which accounts for 80% of primary intraocular tumors, could be as high as 25% depending on the size, ciliary body involvement and extraocular extension. The treatments of intraocular tumors include eye-sparing approaches such as radiotherapy and thermotherapy, and the more aggressive enucleation. The accurate diagnosis of intraocular tumors is thereby critical in the management and follow-up of the patients. The diagnosis of intraocular tumors is usually based on clinical examination with acoustic backscattering based ultrasonography. By analyzing the high frequency fluctuations within the ultrasound (US) signals, microarchitecture information inside the tumor can be characterized. However, US cannot interrogate the histochemical components formulating the microarchitecture. One representative example is the inability of US imaging (and other contemporary imaging modalities as well) in differentiating nevoid and melanoma cells as the two types of cells possesses similar acoustic backscattering properties. Combining optical and US imaging, photoacoustic (PA) measurements encode both the microarchitecture and histochemical component information in biological tissue. This study attempts to characterize ocular tumors by analyzing the high frequency signal components in the multispectral PA images. Ex vivo human eye globes with melanoma and retinoblastoma tumors were scanned using less than 6 mJ per square centimeters laser energy with tunable range of 600-1700 nm. A PA-US parallel imaging system with US probes CL15-7 and L22-14 were used to acquire the high frequency PA signals in real time. Preliminary results show that the proposed method can identify uveal melanoma against retinoblastoma tumors. © 2016 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Experimental Design: We imaged 10 female patients ages 48–81 years with malignant nonspecific breast cancer or invasive lobular carcinoma. Three healthy volunteers ages 31–36 years were also imaged. Fast-MSOT was based on unique single-frame-per-pulse (SFPP) image acquisition employed to improve the accuracy of spectral differentiation over using a small number of wavelengths.

Hyper-spectral imaging has been shown to improve sensitivity while retaining specificity when compared to white-light imaging in both microscopy and in vivo imaging. However, hyperspectral imaging methods have historically suffered from slow acquisition times due to the narrow bandwidth of spectral filters. Often minutes are required to gather a full image stack. We have developed a novel approach called excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging that provides 2-3 orders of magnitude increased signal strength. This reduces acquisition times significantly, allowing for live video acquisition. Here, we describe a preliminary prototype excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging system that can be coupled with endoscopes or microscopes for hyperspectral imaging of tissues and cells. Our system is comprised of three subsystems: illumination, transmission, and imaging. The illumination subsystem employs light-emitting diode arrays to illuminate at different wavelengths. The transmission subsystem utilizes a unique geometry of optics and a liquid light guide. Software controls allow us to interface with and control the subsystems and components. Digital and analog signals are used to coordinate wavelength intensity, cycling and camera triggering. Testing of the system shows it can cycle 16 wavelengths at as fast as 1 ms per cycle. Additionally, more than 18% of the light transmits through the system. Our setup should allow for hyperspectral imaging of tissue and cells in real time. © 2016 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

While the flexible endoscope’s fiber optic cables provide the advantage of flexibility, they also introduce an interfering honeycomb-like pattern onto images. Due to the substantial impact this pattern has on locating cancerous tissue, it must be removed before the HS data can be further processed. Thereby, the loss of information is to minimize avoiding the suppression of small-area variations of pixel values. We have developed a system that uses flexible endoscopy to record HS cubes of the larynx and designed a special filtering technique to remove the honeycomb-like pattern with minimal loss of information. We have confirmed its feasibility by comparing it to conventional filtering techniques using an objective metric and by applying unsupervised and supervised classifications to raw and pre-processed HS cubes. Compared to conventional techniques, our method successfully removes the honeycomb-like pattern and considerably improves classification performance, while preserving image details. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","MDPI AG","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This practice is frequently carried out on suspicious lesions to rule out a malignant process. Therefore, as a result, many biopsies are done on benign lesions. Unlike other fields of medicine that rely on noninvasive imaging modalities, the use of imaging devices in dermatology has not been as robust. This has been mainly due to the limited resolution offered by imaging devices that is needed to detect malignant changes in the cutaneous layers. However, the demand for more efficient in vivo and ex vivo imaging tools to reduce the amount of biopsies have led to new areas of investigation using noninvasive modalities to augment the clinical diagnosis of skin cancer. The use of noninvasive imaging both in vivo and ex vivo has the potential to increase efficiency of diagnosis and management, decrease healthcare cost, improve clinical care and enhance patient satisfaction. © 2015 Future Medicine Ltd.","Future Medicine Ltd.","Review","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Current imaging technologies are particularly limited when it comes to detecting very small tumors in vivo, i.e., very early cancers or metastases, differentiating viable tumor from surrounding dead tumor tissue, and evaluating tumor metabolism within tissue. Optoacoustic imaging offers potential solutions to these imaging problems because of its ability to image optical absorption properties of both intrinsic tissue chromophores and exogenous contrast agents without the involvement of ionizing radiation. Optoacoustic imaging uses pulsed laser to induce localized thermoelastic expansion that generates acoustic waves detectable by an ultrasound transducer. To date, multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) has primarily been used in preclinical research; however, its use in translational and clinical research is expanding. This review focuses on current and emerging applications of optoacoustic imaging for molecular imaging of cancer using both exogenous and endogenous contrast agents and sheds light on potential future clinical applications. ©2016 American Association for Cancer Research.","American Association for Cancer Research Inc.","Review","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Undetected residual malignant tissue often results in the need for additional treatment or surgical intervention. The Solaris platform is a multispectral open-air fluorescence imaging system designed for translational fluorescence-guided surgery. Solaris supports video-rate imaging in four fixed fluorescence channels ranging from visible to near infrared, and a multispectral channel equipped with a liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF) for multispectral image acquisition (520-620 nm). Identification of tumor margins using reagents emitting in the visible spectrum (400-650 nm), such as fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), present challenges considering the presence of auto-fluorescence from tissue and food in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. To overcome this, Solaris acquires LCTF-based multispectral images, and by applying an automated spectral unmixing algorithm to the data, separates reagent fluorescence from tissue and food auto-fluorescence. The unmixing algorithm uses vertex component analysis to automatically extract the primary pure spectra, and resolves the reagent fluorescent signal using non-negative least squares. For validation, intraoperative in vivo studies were carried out in tumor-bearing rodents injected with FITC-dextran reagent that is primarily residing in malignant tissue 24 hours post injection. In the absence of unmixing, fluorescence from tumors is not distinguishable from that of surrounding tissue. Upon spectral unmixing, the FITC-labeled malignant regions become well defined and detectable. The results of these studies substantiate the multispectral power of Solaris in resolving FITC-based agent signal in deep tumor masses, under ambient and surgical light, and enhancing the ability to surgically resect them. © 2017 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

We propose a hybrid system which displays an endoscopic image with a fast joint inspection of tissue surface shape using structured light (SL) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI). For SL a miniature fibre probe is used to project a coloured spot pattern onto the tissue surface. In HSI mode standard endoscopic illumination is used,with the fibre probe collecting reflected light and encoding the spatial information into a linear format that can be imaged onto the slit of a spectrograph. Correspondence between the arrangement of fibres at the distal and proximal ends of the bundle was found using spectral encoding. Then during pattern decoding,a fully convolutional network (FCN) was used for spot detection,followed by a matching propagation algorithm for spot identification. This method enabled fast reconstruction (12 frames per second) using a GPU. The hyperspectral image was combined with the white light image and the reconstructed surface,showing the spectral information of different areas. Validation of this system using phantom and ex vivo experiments has been demonstrated. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Springer Verlag","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, many solid nanoparticles exhibit a great potential to induce toxicity, hindering their use for clinical applications. On the other hand, near-infrared (NIR) dyes have also been used for extensive biological applications, but show some limitations due to their poor aqueous stability, tendency to aggregation and rapid elimination from the body. An alternative proposed in this work to overcome these limitations is the use of NIR dye-loaded nanoparticles. Here we introduce nanoparticles constructed with poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer widely used for biomedical applications, attached to the polycation polyethyleneimine (PEI) to obtain positively charged nanoparticles. The in vivo biodistribution of the cationic PEI-PLGA nanoparticles was investigated after administration through three different routes (intravenous, intraperitoneal and subcutaneous) using multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT). The prepared nanoparticles exhibited good colloidal stability and adequate optical properties for optoacoustic imaging. The in vivo biodistribution assays indicated a strong accumulation of the particles in the liver and spleen, and retention in these organs for at least 24h. Therefore, these nanoparticles could find promising applications in MSOT due to a sharp and characteristic optoacoustic spectrum and high optoacoustic signal generation, and become a promising building block for theranostic strategies. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

This is, in part, due to the limited contrast of lymphatic fluids and structures. Photoacoustic imaging, in combination with optically absorbing dyes or nanoparticles, has great potential for noninvasively visualizing the lymphatic vessels deep in tissues. Multispectral photoacoustic imaging is capable of separating the components; however, the slow wavelength switching speed of most laser systems is inadequate for imaging lymphatic pumping without motion artifacts being introduced into the processed images. We investigate two approaches for visualizing lymphatic processes in vivo. First, single-wavelength differential photoacoustic imaging is used to visualize lymphatic pumping in the hindlimb of a mouse in real time. Second, a fast-switching multiwavelength photoacoustic imaging system was used to assess the propulsion profile of dyes through the lymphatics in real time.

Monitoring the healing response of injured tissue is of high importance for basic research and clinical practice. In traditional application, biological markers characterize normal and abnormal wound healing. Understanding functional relationships of these biological processes is essential for developing new treatment strategies. However, most of the present techniques (in vitro or in vivo) include invasive microscopic or analytical tissue sampling. In the present study, a noninvasive alternative for monitoring processes during wound healing is introduced. Within this context, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an emerging and innovative non-invasive imaging technique with different opportunities in medical applications. HSI acquires the spectral reflectance of an object, depending on its biochemical and structural characteristics. An in-vitro 3-dimensional (3-D) wound model was established and incubated without and with acute and chronic wound fluid (AWF, CWF), respectively. Hyperspectral images of each individual specimen of this 3-D wound model were assessed at day 0/5/10 in vitro, and reflectance spectra were evaluated. For analysing the complex hyperspectral data, an efficient unsupervised approach for clustering massive hyperspectral data was designed, based on efficient hierarchical decomposition of spectral information according to archetypal data points. It represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of an advanced Data Mining approach in context of non-invasive analysis of wounds using hyperspectral imagery. By this, temporal and spatial pattern of hyperspectral clusters were determined within the tissue discs and among the different treatments. Results from non-invasive imaging were compared to the number of cells in the various clusters, assessed by Hematoxylin/Eosin (H/E) staining. It was possible to correlate cell quantity and spectral reflectance during wound closure in a 3-D wound model in vitro. © 2017 Wahabzada et al.

Current treatment options are dialysis or renal transplantation, which apart from their significant drawbacks in terms of increased morbidity and mortality, are placing an increasing economic burden on society. Cell-based Regenerative Medicine Therapies (RMTs) have shown great promise in rodent models of kidney disease, but clinical translation is hampered due to the lack of adequate safety and efficacy data. Furthermore, the mechanisms whereby the cell-based RMTs ameliorate injury are ill-defined. For instance, it is not always clear if the cells directly replace damaged renal tissue, or whether paracrine effects are more important. Knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of cell therapies is crucial because it could lead to the development of safer and more effective RMTs in the future. To address these questions, novel in vivo imaging strategies are needed to monitor the biodistribution of cell-based RMTs and evaluate their beneficial effects on host tissues and organs, as well as any potential adverse effects. In this review we will discuss how state-of-the-art imaging modalities, including bioluminescence, magnetic resonance, nuclear imaging, ultrasound and an emerging imaging technology called multispectral optoacoustic tomography, can be used in combination with various imaging probes to track the fate and biodistribution of cell-based RMTs in rodent models of kidney disease, and evaluate their effect on renal function. © 2016 The Authors","Elsevier B.V.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

We report on the synthesis, optical properties of a series of styryl dyes (d1-d14), and the anomalous photophysical behavior of several of these donor-acceptor pairs separated by long conjugated π-systems (d7-d10). We further describe an unusual dual emission behavior with two distinct ground state conformers which could be individually excited to locally excited (LE) and twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) excited state in push-pull dye systems (d7, d9 and d10). Additionally, unexpected emission behavior in dye systems d7 and d8 wherein the amino-derivative d7 displayed a dual emission in polar medium while the N,N-dimethyl derivative d8 and other methylated derivatives d12-d14 showed only LE emission but did not show any TICT emission. Based on photophysical and nerve binding studies, we down selected compounds that exhibited the most robust fluorescent staining of nerve tissue sections.

However, existing wound assessment methods are typically subjective and qualitative, with the need for sequential data acquisition and coregistration between modalities, and lack of reliable standards for performance evaluation or calibration. To overcome these limitations, we developed a multimodal imaging system for quasi-simultaneous assessment of cutaneous tissue oxygenation and perfusion in a quantitative and noninvasive fashion. The system integrated multispectral and laser speckle imaging technologies into one experimental setup. Tissue oxygenation and perfusion were reconstructed by advanced algorithms. The accuracy and reliability of the imaging system were quantitatively validated in calibration experiments and a tissue-simulating phantom test. The experimental results were compared with a commercial oxygenation and perfusion monitor. Dynamic detection of cutaneous tissue oxygenation and perfusion was also demonstrated in vivo by a postocclusion reactive hyperemia procedure in a human subject and a wound healing process in a wounded mouse model. Our in vivo experiments not only validated the performance of the multimodal imaging system for cutaneous tissue oxygenation and perfusion imaging but also demonstrated its technical potential for wound healing assessment in clinical practice. © 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","SPIE","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

PDT is a promising new modality in the treatment of cancers, which employs the interaction between a tumor-localizing photosensitizer and light of an appropriate wavelength to bring about ROS-induced cell death. In vitro results showed that protein EGFP-EGF1modification could significantly contribute to the uptake of nanoparticles by TF over-expressed BCECs. In vivo multispectral fluorescent imaging, the EGFP-EGF1 conjugated nanoparticles showed significantly higher accumulation in tumor tissues than non-conjugated ones. Tumor tissue slides further presented that EGFP-EGF1 conjugated nanoparticles showed significantly higher accumulation in tumor vasculature than non-conjugated ones. In vitro study demonstrated that PDT increased TF expression of BCECs. In vivo imaging, ex vivo imaging and tumor tissue slides showed that PDT further contribute EGFP-EGF1-NP accumulation in tumor. These promising results indicated that PDT enhanced EGFP-EGF1modified PEG-PLGA nanoparticle accumulation in tumor vaculature. Considering that EGFPEGF1 conjugation enhanced nanoparticles uptake by TF over-expressed endothelium and PDT increased endothelium TF expression. We conclude that PDT triggered a TF cascade targeted effect.

The use of multiple narrow wavelength bands in the near infrared (NIR) range theoretically allows not only to image brain tissue oxygenation and hemodynamics via mapping of hemoglobin concentration changes, but also to directly quantify cerebral metabolism via measurement of the redox states of mitochondrial cytochrome-c-oxidase (CCO). The aim of this study is to assess the possibility of performing hyperspectral imaging of in vivo cerebral oxyhemoglobin (HbO2), deoxyhemoglobin (HHb) and oxidized CCO (oxCCO) using commercially available HSI devices. For this reason, a hyperspectral snapshot solution based on Cubert GmbH technology (S185 FireflEYE camera) has been tested on the exposed cortex of mice during normoxic, hypoxic and hyperoxic conditions. The system allows simultaneous acquisition of 138 wavelength bands between 450 and 998 nm, with spectral sampling and resolution of ~4 to 8 nm. From the hyperspectral data, relative changes in concentration of hemoglobin and oxCCO are estimated and hemodynamic and metabolic maps of the imaged cortex are calculated for two different NIR spectral ranges. Spectroscopic analysis at particular regions of interest is also performed, showing typical oxygen-dependent hemodynamic responses. The results highlight some of the potentials of the technology, but also the limitations of the tested commercial solution for such specific application, in particular regarding spatial resolution. © 2018, The Author(s).","Springer New York LLC","Book chapter","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

As a more effective method to localize soft tissue targets, we developed an online bioluminescence tomography (BLT) system for small-animal radiation research platform (SARRP). We demonstrated BLT-guided radiation therapy and validated targeting accuracy based on a newly developed reconstruction algorithm. Methods and Materials The BLT system was designed to dock with the SARRP for image acquisition and to be detached before radiation delivery. A 3-mirror system was devised to reflect the bioluminescence emitted from the subject to a stationary charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Multispectral BLT and the incomplete variables truncated conjugate gradient method with a permissible region shrinking strategy were used as the optimization scheme to reconstruct bioluminescent source distributions. To validate BLT targeting accuracy, a small cylindrical light source with high CBCT contrast was placed in a phantom and also in the abdomen of a mouse carcass. The center of mass (CoM) of the source was recovered from BLT and used to guide radiation delivery. The accuracy of the BLT-guided targeting was validated with films and compared with the CBCT-guided delivery. In vivo experiments were conducted to demonstrate BLT localization capability for various source geometries. Results Online BLT was able to recover the CoM of the embedded light source with an average accuracy of 1 mm compared to that with CBCT localization. Differences between BLT- and CBCT-guided irradiation shown on the films were consistent with the source localization revealed in the BLT and CBCT images. In vivo results demonstrated that our BLT system could potentially be applied for multiple targets and tumors. Conclusions The online BLT/CBCT/SARRP system provides an effective solution for soft tissue targeting, particularly for small, nonpalpable, or orthotopic tumor models. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Elsevier Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In the present study, we aimed to assess the difference in the in vivo spectral reflectance of malignant colorectal tumors and normal mucosa. A total of 21 colorectal tumors or adenomatous polyps from 12 patients at Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital were examined using a flexible hyperspectral (HS) colonoscopy system that can obtain in vivo HS images of the colorectal mucosa. We determined the optimal wavelengths for differentiating tumors from normal tissue based on these recorded images.

The operational principles and designs of ten portable in-vivo skin imaging prototypes developed at the Biophotonics Laboratory of Institute of Atomic Physics and Spectroscopy, University of Latvia during the recent five years are presented in this paper. Four groups of imaging devices are considered. Multi-spectral imagers offer possibilities for distant mapping of specific skin parameters, thus facilitating better diagnostics of skin malformations. Autofluorescence intensity and photobleaching rate imagers show a promising potential for skin tumor identification and margin delineation. Photoplethysmography video-imagers ensure remote detection of cutaneous blood pulsations and can provide real-time information on cardiovascular parameters and anesthesia efficiency. Multimodal skin imagers perform several of the abovementioned functions by taking a number of spectral and video images with the same image sensor.

The importance of neurovascular cross-talk in the central nervous system has recently come into focus with the growing awareness that these two systems interact extensively both during development, in the stem-cell niche, and in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. With respect to the peripheral nervous system, however, there have been no live, real-time investigations of the potential relationship between these two developing systems. To address this deficit, we used multispectral 4D time-lapse imaging in a transgenic quail model in which endothelial cells (ECs) express a yellow fluorescent marker, while neural crest cells (NCCs) express an electroporated red fluorescent marker. We monitored EC and NCC migration in real-time during formation of the peripheral nervous system. Our time-lapse recordings indicate that NCCs and ECs are physically juxtaposed and dynamically interact at multiple locations along their trajectories. These interactions are stereotypical and occur at precise anatomical locations along the NCC migratory pathway. NCCs migrate alongside the posterior surface of developing intersomitic vessels, but fail to cross these continuous streams of motile ECs. NCCs change their morphology and migration trajectory when they encounter gaps in the developing vasculature. Within the nascent dorsal root ganglion, proximity to ECs causes filopodial retraction which curtails forward persistence of NCC motility. Overall, our time-lapse recordings support the conclusion that primary vascular networks substantially influence the distribution and migratory behavior of NCCs and the patterned formation of dorsal root and sympathetic ganglia. © 2016.","Academic Press Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

However, to date, these techniques have not been effectively translated to real-time endoscope platforms. Hyperspectral imaging of the fluorescence excitation spectrum represents new technology that may be well suited for endoscopic implementation. However, the feasibility of detecting differences between normal and cancerous mucosa using fluorescence excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging has not been evaluated. The goal of this study was to evaluate the initial feasibility of using fluorescence excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging for measuring changes in fluorescence excitation spectrum concurrent with colonic adenocarcinoma using a small pre-pilot-scale sample size. Ex vivo analysis was performed using resected pairs of colorectal adenocarcinoma and normal mucosa. Adenocarcinoma was confirmed by histologic evaluation of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) permanent sections. Specimens were imaged using a custom hyperspectral imaging fluorescence excitation-scanning microscope system. Results demonstrated consistent spectral differences between normal and cancerous tissues over the fluorescence excitation range of 390 to 450 nm that could be the basis for wavelength-dependent detection of colorectal cancers. Hence, excitation-scanning hyperspectral imaging may offer an alternative approach for discriminating adenocarcinoma from surrounding normal colonic mucosa, but further studies will be required to evaluate the accuracy of this approach using a larger patient cohort. © 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","SPIE","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Applications have ranged from single-cell microscopy to whole-animal in vivo imaging and from basic research to clinical systems. Enabling this growth has been the availability of faster, more effective hyperspectral filtering technologies and more sensitive detectors. Hence, the potential for growth of biomedical hyperspectral imaging is high, and many hyperspectral imaging options are already commercially available. However, despite the growth in hyperspectral technologies for biomedical imaging, little work has been done to aid users of hyperspectral imaging instruments in selecting appropriate analysis algorithms. Here, we present an approach for comparing the effectiveness of spectral analysis algorithms by combining experimental image data with a theoretical ""what if"" scenario. This approach allows us to quantify several key outcomes that characterize a hyperspectral imaging study: linearity of sensitivity, positive detection cut-off slope, dynamic range, and false positive events. We present results of using this approach for comparing the effectiveness of several common spectral analysis algorithms for detecting weak fluorescent protein emission in the midst of strong tissue autofluorescence. Results indicate that this approach should be applicable to a very wide range of applications, allowing a quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of the combined biology, hardware, and computational analysis for detecting a specific molecular signature. © 2017 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In this study, we present a method of visualization and diagnostics of skin and lung tumours based on registration and processing of tissues hyperspectral images. In a series of experiments registration of hyperspectral images of skin and lung tissue samples is carried out. Melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, nevi and benign tumours are studied in skin ex vivo and in vivo experiments; adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas are studied in ex vivo lung experiments. In a series of experiments the typical features of diffuse reflection spectra for pathological and normal tissues were found. Changes in tissues morphology during the tumour growth lead to the changes of blood and pigments concentration, such as melanin in skin. That is why tumours and normal tissues maybe differentiated with information about spectral response in 500-600 nm and 600 - 670 nm areas.

The work presented in this paper tries to establish a novel way in the use of hyperspectral images to help neurosurgeons to accurately determine the tumour boundaries in the process of brain tumour resection, avoiding excessive extraction of healthy tissue and the accidental leaving of un-resected small tumour tissues. So as to do that, a hyperspectral database of in-vivo human brain samples has been created and a procedure to label the pixels diagnosed by the pathologists has been described. A total of 24646 samples from normal and tumour tissues from 13 different patients have been obtained. A pre-processing chain to homogenize the spectral signatures has been developed, obtaining 3 types of datasets (using different pre-processing chain) in order to determine which one provides the best classification results using a Random Forest classifier. The experimental results of this supervised classification algorithm to distinguish between normal and tumour tissues have achieved more than 99% of accuracy.

Recently, such treatments have become available in at-home setting due to advent of self-application NAFT devices. Safety and clinical efficacy of NAFT are well established in multiple studies. Less information is available on morphological and functional changes in tissue occurring as a result of NAFT. Polarization-enhanced multispectral wide-field imaging device allows for in vivo real time visualization of dermal structures. The objective of this study is to use this imaging modality to monitor early effects of the home-use NAFT on collagen networks. Materials and Methods Eight subjects (skin types I-III) used a commercially available NAFT device (wavelength 1410 nm, energy per pulse up to 15 mJ) to treat peri-orbital wrinkles in standard recommended mode, that is daily, for a period of two weeks. In each session, subjects applied a pre-treatment gel to the peri-orbital areas and then used the device, delivering 8-10 applications to each side of the face without overlap. Subjects were asked to use the highest device setting. Cross-polarized 440 nm wide-field images were acquired from peri-orbital areas before and two weeks after the onset of the treatment regimen. Wide-field images were normalized and thresholded to a level of 40% brightness to emphasize collagen structure. Collagen content was quantitatively determined from thresholded collagen images. Improvement in collagen content at two weeks of daily treatments was assessed. Results Eight subjects (age 24-53 years) completed the study. Cross-polarized 440 nm wide-field images clearly delineated collagen networks. Quantitative assessment of collagen images revealed statistically significant (P < 0.05) improvement of collagen content at a time point of two weeks. Seven out of eight subjects showed varying degree of improvement. The increase of collagen content in responders ranged from 1-26%, with the mean improvement of 11%. Subjects in their early 40s showed the best improvement in comparison to younger and older age groups. Conclusions Polarization-enhanced multispectral wide-field reflectance imaging method is a suitable technique for noninvasive in vivo assessment of dermal structures. Post-treatment images, taken three days after the last treatment session, demonstrate that non-ablative fractional treatment resulted in increased dermal collagen content as measured by the polarization-enhanced technique as early as two weeks post onset of the treatments. However, further studies with a larger number of subjects and longer treatment period are required to determine the optimal regimen and how long the results will last. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","John Wiley and Sons Inc.","Article","","Scopus"

The study analyzes Wiener filtering in Fourier domain when a family of anisotropic shape filters is considered. The unknown noise and signal power spectral densities are estimated using spectral information of images and the autoregressive of the power 1 (AR(1) model. Edge preservation is achieved by detecting image edges in the original and the denoised image and superimposing a weighted contribution of the two edge images to the resulting denoised image. The method is tested on multispectral photoacoustic images from simulations, a tissue-mimicking phantom, as well as in vivo imaging of the mouse, with its performance compared against that of the standard Wiener filtering in Fourier domain. The results reveal better denoising and fine details preservation capabilities of the proposed method when compared to that of the standard Wiener filtering in Fourier domain, suggesting that this could be a useful denoising technique for other multispectral photoacoustic studies. © 2016 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The authors systematically assessed the performance of the BLT system in terms of target localization and the ability to resolve two neighboring sources in simulations, tissue-mimicking phantom, and in vivo environments. Methods: Multispectral measurements acquired in a single projection were used for the BLT reconstruction. The incomplete variables truncated conjugate gradient algorithm with an iterative permissible region shrinking strategy was employed as the optimization scheme to reconstruct source distributions. Simulation studies were conducted for single spherical sources with sizes from 0.5 to 3 mm radius at depth of 3-12 mm. The same configuration was also applied for the double source simulation with source separations varying from 3 to 9 mm. Experiments were performed in a standalone BLT/CBCT system. Two self-illuminated sources with 3 and 4.7 mm separations placed inside a tissue-mimicking phantom were chosen as the test cases. Live mice implanted with single-source at 6 and 9 mm depth, two sources at 3 and 5 mm separation at depth of 5 mm, or three sources in the abdomen were also used to illustrate the localization capability of the BLT system for multiple targets in vivo. Results: For simulation study, approximate 1 mm accuracy can be achieved at localizing center of mass (CoM) for single-source and grouped CoM for double source cases. For the case of 1.5 mm radius source, a common tumor size used in preclinical study, their simulation shows that for all the source separations considered, except for the 3 mm separation at 9 and 12 mm depth, the two neighboring sources can be resolved at depths from 3 to 12 mm. Phantom experiments illustrated that 2D bioluminescence imaging failed to distinguish two sources, but BLT can provide 3D source localization with approximately 1 mm accuracy. The in vivo results are encouraging that 1 and 1.7 mm accuracy can be attained for the single-source case at 6 and 9mmdepth, respectively. For the 2 sources in vivo study, both sources can be distinguished at 3 and 5 mm separations, and approximately 1 mm localization accuracy can also be achieved. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that their multispectral BLT/CBCT system could be potentially applied to localize and resolve multiple sources at wide range of source sizes, depths, and separations. The average accuracy of localizing CoM for single-source and grouped CoM for double sources is approximately 1 mm except deep-seated target. The information provided in this study can be instructive to devise treatment margins for BLT-guided irradiation. These results also suggest that the 3D BLT system could guide radiation for the situation with multiple targets, such as metastatic tumor models. © 2016 American Association of Physicists in Medicine..","AAPM - American Association of Physicists in Medicine","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

During the process of tissue development, an ideal scaffold should remodel at a rate matching with scaffold degradation. To reduce amount of animals sacrificed, non-invasive in vivo imaging of biomaterials is required which relies on using of biocompatible and in situ gel forming compounds carrying suitable imaging agents. In this study we developed a method of in situ fabrication of fluorescently labeled and injectable hyaluronan (HA) hydrogel based on one pot sequential use of Michael addition and thiol-disulfide exchange reactions for the macromolecules labeling and cross-linking respectively. Hydrogels with different content of HA were prepared and their enzymatic degradation was followed in vitro and in vivo using fluorescence multispectral imaging. First, we confirmed that the absorbance of the matrix-linked near-IR fluorescent IRDye® 800CW agent released due to the matrix enzymatic degradation in vitro matched the amount of the degraded hydrogel measured by classical gravimetric method. Secondly, the rate of degradation was inversely proportional to the hydrogel concentration and this structure-degradation relationship was similar for both in vitro and in vivo studies. It implies that the degradation of this disulfide cross-linked hyaluronan hydrogel in vivo can be predicted basing on the results of its in vitro degradation studies. The compliance of in vitro and in vivo methods is also promising for the future development of predictive in vitro tissue engineering models. Statement of significance The need for engineered hydrogel scaffolds that deliver bioactive factors to endogenous progenitor cells in vivo via gradual matrix resorption and thus facilitate tissue regeneration is increasing with the aging population. Importantly, scaffold should degrade at a modest rate that will not be too fast to support tissue growth nor too slow to provide space for tissue development. The present work is devoted to longitudinal tracking of a hydrogel material in vivo from the time of its implantation to the time of complete resorption without sacrificing animals. The method demonstrates correlation of resorption rates in vivo and in vitro for hydrogels with varied structural parameters. It opens the possibility to develop predictive in vitro models for tissue engineered scaffolds and reduce animal studies. © 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we present a novel, near real-time technique for intrinsic measurements of total haemoglobin (THb) and blood oxygenation (SO2) in tissue using only RGB images from a stereo laparoscope. The high degree of spectral overlap between channels makes inference of haemoglobin concentration challenging, non-linear and under constrained. We decompose the problem into two constrained linear sub-problems and show that with Tikhonov regularisation the estimation significantly improves, giving robust estimation of the THb. We demonstrate by using the coregistered stereo image data from two cameras it is possible to get robust SO2 estimation as well. Our method is closed from, providing computational efficiency even with multiple cameras. The method we present requires only spectral response calibration of each camera, without modification of existing laparoscopic imaging hardware. We validate our technique on synthetic data from Monte Carlo simulation and further, in vivo, on a multispectral porcine data set. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.","Springer Verlag","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Spectrosocopic photoacoustic (PA) imaging is a label-free, noninvasive technique that probes the in vivo oxygenation status of hemoglobin, resulting in a measurement of oxygen saturation (SO2) and providing a surrogate measure of tissue hypoxia. This work investigates multispectral PA imaging to assess the SO2 in the femoral bone marrow in mice. Preliminary work was performed to assess the capability of imaging through bone, followed by an oxygen challenge to determine the magnitude of systemic SO2 changes measurable in wild type mice. Furthermore, a pilot study to compare SO2 measured in a murine model of ALL versus in healthy controls was performed to investigate a correlation between SO2 changes in the femoral bone marrow and disease progression. Study results show that femoral SO2 can be measured with a variation less than 10% in wild type mice over multiple time-points. In the oxygen challenge, a 10% difference in systemic SO2 was observed between 100% and 21% O2 inhalation conditions. Additionally, leukemic mice demonstrate significantly more variation in femoral SO2 over the length of the femur than control mice at day 14 post-inoculation, indicating that femoral SO2 is affected by leukemic disease progression. This work demonstrates the feasibility of observing changes in leukemic disease progression through the measurement of SO2 with spectroscopic PA imaging, which could help develop a more complete understanding of the interplay of the local microenvironment with leukemogenesis. © 2018 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Based on spectral features, optoacoustic imaging is capable of visualizing angiogenesis and imaging cancer heterogeneity of malignant tumors through endogenous hemoglobin. However, high-resolution structural and functional imaging of whole tumor mass is limited by modest penetration and image quality, due to the insufficient capability of ultrasound detectors and the twodimensional scan geometry. In this study, we introduce a novel multi-spectral optoacoustic mesoscopy (MSOM) for imaging subcutaneous or orthotopic tumors implanted in lab mice, with the high-frequency ultrasound linear array and a conical scanning geometry. Detailed volumetric images of vasculature and oxygen saturation of tissue in the entire tumors are obtained in vivo, at depths up to 10 mm with the desirable spatial resolutions approaching 70μm. This unprecedented performance enables the visualization of vasculature morphology and hypoxia conditions has been verified with ex vivo studies. These findings demonstrate the potential of MSOM for preclinical oncological studies in deep solid tumors to facilitate the characterization of tumor's angiogenesis and the evaluation of treatment strategies. © 2017 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been the subject of much interest as they are able to generate a local dose enhancing effect (DEE), allowing lower intensity beams to achieve a given effect, sparing healthy tissue. It is important that GNP distributions can be ascertained before radiotherapy begins so that accurate treatment plans can be made. Two imaging modalities that show great promise in being able to identify these GNPs in vivo without delivering excessive DEEs are photoacoustic imaging (PAI) and photon counting multi-spectral x-ray imaging (x-CSI). This work forms part of a larger project to assess the feasibility of using x-CSI and PAI to predict DEEs during radiotherapy planning. This work assessed the degradation of gold nanorods (GNRs) in a photoacoustic system sold by iThera, specifically comparing the protective effects against degradation afforded by a silica coating as opposed to GNR PEGylation. This coating is also hoped to prevent spectral broadening when the GNRs are endocytosed, allowing PAI to confirm uptake of GNRs by cells. With regards x-CSI, this work uses a combination of Monte Carlo and Finite Element modelling techniques to realistically model cylindrical phantoms of high-Z materials in order to demonstrate the potential improvements in imaging contrast that x-CSI can produce over traditional energy integrated x-ray imaging techniques.

Tissues are heterogeneous in nature; an imaging voxel contains an ensemble of different cells and extracellular matrix components. A long-standing challenge has been to infer the content of and interactions among these microscopic tissue components within a macroscopic imaging voxel. Spatially resolved multidimensional relaxation–diffusion correlation (REDCO) spectroscopy holds the potential to deliver such microdynamic information. However, to date, vast data requirements have mostly relegated these type of measurements to nuclear magnetic resonance applications and prevented them from being widely and successfully used in conjunction with imaging. By using a novel data acquisition and processing strategy in this study, spatially resolved REDCO could be performed in reasonable scanning times with excellent prospects for clinical applications. This new MR imaging framework—which we term “magnetic resonance microdynamic imaging (MRMI)”—permits the simultaneous noninvasive and model-free quantification of multiple subcellular, cellular, and interstitial tissue microenvironments within a voxel. MRMI is demonstrated with a fixed spinal cord specimen, enabling the quantification of microscopic tissue components with unprecedented specificity. Tissue components, such as axons, neuronal and glial soma, and myelin were identified on the basis of their multispectral signature within individual imaging voxels. These tissue elements could then be composed into images and be correlated with immunohistochemistry findings. MRMI provides novel image contrasts of tissue components and a new family of microdynamic biomarkers that could lead to new diagnostic imaging approaches to probe biological tissue alterations accompanied by pathological or developmental changes. © 2017","Academic Press Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, there are few methods to evaluate them during surgery. The aim of this study was to establish an in vivo, non-contact, and label-free imaging method for identifying atherosclerotic plaque lesions from outside vessels with a diffuse-reflectance near-infrared (NIR) hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system. Methods: NIR spectra between 1000 and 2350 nm were measured using an NIR HSI imaging system outside the exposed abdominal aorta in five Watanabe Heritable Hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits in vivo. Preprocessed data were input to a supervised machine learning algorithm called a support vector machine (SVM) to create pixel-based images that can predict atherosclerotic plaques within a vessel. The images were compared with histological findings. Results: Absorbance was significantly higher in plaques than in normal arteries at 1000-1380, 1580-1810, and 1880-2320 nm. Overall predictive performance showed a sensitivity of 0.814 ± 0.017, a specificity of 0.836 ± 0.020, and an accuracy of 0.827 ± 0.008. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.905 (95% confidence interval = 0.904-0.906). Conclusions: The NIR HSI system combined with a machine learning algorithm enabled accurate detection of atherosclerotic plaques within an internal vessel with high spatial resolution from outside the vessel. The findings indicate that the NIR HSI system can provide non-contact, label-free, and precise localization of atherosclerotic plaques during vascular surgery. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Methods: Hyperspectral autofluorescence emission images were captured between 420 and 720 nm (10-nm intervals), at two excitation bands (436-460, 480-510 nm), from three locations (fovea, perifovea, near-periphery) in 20 normal RPE/Bruch’s membrane (BrM) flatmounts. Mathematical factorization extracted a BrM spectrum (S0) and abundant lipofuscin/melanolipofuscin (LF/ML) spectra of RPE origin (S1, S2, S3) from each tissue. Results: Smooth spectra S1 to S3, with perinuclear localization consistent with LF/ML at all three retinal locations and both excitations in 14 eyes (84 datasets), were included in the analysis. The mean peak emissions of S0, S1, and S2 at ʎex 436 nm were, respectively, 495 ± 14, 535 ± 17, and 576 ± 20 nm. S3 was generally trimodal, with peaks at either 580, 620, or 650 nm (peak mode, 650 nm). At ʎex 480 nm, S0, S1, and S2 were red-shifted to 526 ± 9, 553 ± 10, and 588 ± 23 nm, and S3 was again trimodal (peak mode, 620 nm). S1 often split into two spectra, S1A and S1B. S3 strongly colocalized with melanin. There were no significant differences across age, sex, or retinal location. Conclusions: There appear to be at least three families of abundant RPE fluorophores that are ubiquitous across age, retinal location, and sex in this sample of healthy eyes. Further molecular characterization by imaging mass spectrometry and localization via super-resolution microscopy should elucidate normal and abnormal RPE physiology involving fluorophores.

Conventionally, antigen expression level is examined by immunohistochemistry of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue section. This method represents the diagnostic “gold standard” for tumor target evaluation, but is affected by a number of factors, such as epitope masking and insufficient antigen retrieval. As a consequence, variances and discrepancies in histological staining results can occur, which may influence decision-making and therapeutic outcome. To overcome these problems, we have used different fluorescence-labeled therapeutic antibodies targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family members and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) in combination with fluorescence imaging modalities to determine tumor antigen expression, drug-target interaction, and biodistribution and tumor saturation kinetics in non-small cell lung cancer xenografts. For this, whole-body fluorescence intensities of labeled antibodies, applied as a single compound or antibody mixture, were measured in Calu-1 and Calu-3 tumor-bearing mice, then ex vivo multispectral tumor tissue analysis at microscopic resolution was performed. With the aid of this simple and fast imaging method, we were able to analyze the tumor cell receptor status of HER1–3 and IGF1R, monitor the antibody-target interaction and evaluate the receptor binding sites of anti-HER2-targeting antibodies. Based on this, the most suitable tumor model, best therapeutic antibody, and optimal treatment dosage and application schedule was selected. Predictions drawn from obtained imaging data were in excellent concordance with outcome of conducted preclinical efficacy studies.

However, the clinical outcome of this technique is suboptimal owing to multiple limitations such as nonuniform illumination, high-cost and bulky setup, and time-consuming data acquisition and processing. To overcome these limitations, we acquired the hyperspectral data cube in a wavelength ranging from 600 to 800 nm and processed it by a wide gap second derivative analysis method. This method effectively reduced the image artifacts caused by nonuniform illumination and background absorption. Furthermore, with second derivative analysis, only three specific wavelengths (620, 696, and 772 nm) are needed for tissue classification with optimal separability. Clinical feasibility of the proposed image analysis and classification method was tested in a clinical trial where cervical hyperspectral images from three patients were used for classification analysis. Our proposed method successfully classified the cervix tissue into three categories of normal, inflammation and high-grade lesion. These classification results were coincident with those by an experienced gynecology oncologist after applying acetic acid. Our preliminary clinical study has demonstrated the technical feasibility for in vivo and noninvasive detection of cervical neoplasia without acetic acid.

However, the optical absorption of a semiconducting polymer with a determined structure is hardly tunable when compared with that of inorganic semiconductors. In this work, we show that the optical absorption of polymer nanoparticles from one conjugated backbone can be effectively tuned through judicious design of the particle morphology and the persistence length of polymers. Highly absorbing near-infrared (NIR) polymers based on diketopyrrolopyrrole-dithiophene (DPP-DT) are synthesized to have different molecular weights (MWs). The DPP-DT polymer with a large molecular weight and high persistence length exhibited remarkably high optical absorption with a peak mass extinction coefficient of 81.7 L g−1 cm−1, which is one of the highest value among various photothermal agents reported to date. Particularly, the polymer nanoparticles with different sizes exhibit broadly tunable NIR absorption peaks from 630 to 811 nm. The PEGylated small polymer dots (Pdots) show good NIR light-harvesting efficiency and high non-radiative decay rates, resulting in a relatively high photothermal conversion efficiency in excess of 50%.

It is essential to elucidate the location, erosion, drug release and resection of implanted biomaterials in vivo. Herein, a thermosensitive hydrogel with a protoporphyrin core based on a PEG and PCL copolymer (PCL-PEG-PPOR-PEG-PCL) was synthesized by ring-opening polymerization using protoporphyrin as a fluorescence tag. The optical properties of the hydrogel were investigated by UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy in vitro and by fluorescence imaging system in vivo. The hydrogel erosion and drug delivery in vivo were monitored and tracked by multispectral fluorescence imaging system in nude mice. The results show that the thermosensitive hydrogel exhibits fluorescence and injectability in vivo with good biocompatibility. Through the modality of fluorescence imaging, the status of the hydrogel is reflected in situ in vivo including its location and erosion. Multispectral analysis separates the autofluorescence signals from the specific label and provides the ability to locate the drug and carrier.

Currently, tissue samples are sent to pathology for diagnostic confirmation. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an emerging, non-contact optical imaging technique. A reliable optical method could serve to diagnose and biopsy specimens in real-time. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as a tissue classifier, we developed a method to use HSI to perform an optical biopsy of ex-vivo surgical specimens, collected from 21 patients undergoing surgical cancer resection. Training and testing on samples from different patients, the CNN can distinguish squamous cell carcinoma (SCCa) from normal aerodigestive tract tissues with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.82, 81% accuracy, 81% sensitivity, and 80% specificity. Additionally, normal oral tissues can be sub-classified into epithelium, muscle, and glandular mucosa using a decision tree method, with an average AUC of 0.94, 90% accuracy, 93% sensitivity, and 89% specificity. After separately training on thyroid tissue, the CNN differentiates between thyroid carcinoma and normal thyroid with an AUC of 0.95, 92% accuracy, 92% sensitivity, and 92% specificity. Moreover, the CNN can discriminate medullary thyroid carcinoma from benign multi-nodular goiter (MNG) with an AUC of 0.93, 87% accuracy, 88% sensitivity, and 85% specificity. Classical-type papillary thyroid carcinoma is differentiated from benign MNG with an AUC of 0.91, 86% accuracy, 86% sensitivity, and 86% specificity. Our preliminary results demonstrate that an HSI-based optical biopsy method using CNNs can provide multi-category diagnostic information for normal head-and-neck tissue, SCCa, and thyroid carcinomas. More patient data are needed in order to fully investigate the proposed technique to establish reliability and generalizability of the work. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

In this study, we synthesized, characterized, and investigated the in vivo fate of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide-based polymer conjugates with a drug model bound via a disulfide bond, which is frequently cited in the literature as being completely stable in the bloodstream but readily cleaved after cell internalization. The concept was based on a ""dual"" labeling of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide copolymers with two different fluorescent dyes, where the first dye was linked via a disulfide bond, thus representing a model drug, while the second dye was attached as an amide and served as a label for the polymer carrier. Two conjugates, differing in their molecular weights (30 and 104 kDa), were examined using a multispectral optical imaging technique in athymic nude mice inoculated with HT-29 and DLD-1 human colon carcinoma xenografts. Additionally, necropsied organs and tumors were examined ex vivo to obtain more detailed information about polymer and model drug biodistribution. In vivo results confirmed preferential tumor accumulation for both conjugates.

The enhanced SNR and penetration depth provided by ms2/LCI could be leveraged for a variety of clinical applications including the assessment of burn injuries where current clinical classification of severity only provides limited accuracy. The utility of the approach was demonstrated by imaging a tissue phantom simulating a partial-thickness burn revealing good spectroscopic contrast between healthy and injured tissue regions deep below the sample surface.

This paper uses hyperspectral imaging technology to obtain in vivo images for blood oxygenation detection. The experiment involves dorsal skin fold window chamber preparation which was built on adult (8±10 weeks of age) female BALB/c nu/nu mice and in vivo image acquisition which was performed by hyperspectral imaging system. To get the accurate spatial and spectral information of targets, an automatic registration scheme is proposed. An adaptive feature detection method which combines the local threshold method and the level-set filter is presented to extract target vessels. A reliable feature matching algorithm with the correlative information inherent in hyperspectral images is used to kick out the outliers. Then, the registration images are used for blood oxygenation mapping. Registration evaluation results show that most of the false matches are removed and the smooth and concentrated spectra are obtained. This intensity invariant feature detection with outliers-removing feature matching proves to be effective in hyperspectral vessel image registration. Therefore, in vivo hyperspectral imaging system by the assistance of the proposed registration scheme provides a technique for blood oxygenation research. © 2017 Wang et al.

AGEs accumulate in skin and can be detected using their auto fluorescence (AF). A significant correlation exists between AGE AF and the levels of AGEs as obtained from skin biopsies. A commercial device, the AGE Reader, has become available to assess skin AF for clinical purposes but, while displaying promising results, it is limited to single-point measurements performed in contact to skin tissue. Furthermore, in vivo imaging of AGE accumulation is virtually unexplored. We proposed a non-invasive, contact-less novel technique for quantifying fluorescent AGE deposits in skin tissue using a multispectral imaging camera setup (MSI) during ultraviolet (UV) exposure. Imaging involved applying a region-of-interest mask, avoiding specular reflections and a simple calibration. Results of a study conducted on 16 subjects with skin types ranging from fair to deeply pigmented skin, showed that AGE measured with MSI in forearm skin was significantly correlated with the AGE reference method (AGE Reader on forearm skin, R=0.68, p=0.005). AGE measured in facial skin was borderline significantly related to AGE Reader on forearm skin (R=0.47, p=0.078). These results support the use of the technique in devices for non-touch measurement of AGE content in either facial or forearm skin tissue over time. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Elsevier Ltd","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, the study of adipose browning has been impeded by a lack of imaging tools that allow longitudinal and noninvasive monitoring of this process in vivo. Here, we report a preclinical imaging approach to detect development of beige adipocytes during adrenergic stimulation. In this approach, we expressed near-infrared fluorescent protein, iRFP720, driven under an uncoupling protein-1 (Ucp1) promoter in mice by viral transduction, and used multispectral optoacoustic imaging technology with ultrasound tomography (MSOT-US) to assess adipose beiging during adrenergic stimulation. We observed increased photoacoustic signal at 720 nm, coupled with attenuated lipid signals in stimulated animals. As a proof of concept, we validated our approach against hybrid positron emission tomography combined with magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging modality, and quantified the extent of adipose browning by MRI-guided segmentation of 2-deoxy-2-                             18                             F-fluoro-d-glucose uptake signals. The browning extent detected by MSOT-US and PET/MR are well correlated with Ucp1 induction.

To our knowledge, there have been no studies directly comparing MDSLA and RCM. Objective We conducted a repeated measures analysis comparing the sensitivity and specificity of MDSLA and RCM in the detection of melanoma (n = 55 lesions from 36 patients). Methods Study patients (n = 36) with atypical-appearing pigmented lesions (n = 55) underwent imaging by both RCM and MDSLA. Lesions were biopsied and analyzed by histopathology. Results RCM exhibited superior test metrics (P = .001, McNemar test) compared with MDSLA. Respectively, sensitivity measures were 85.7% and 71.4%, and specificity rates were 66.7% and 25.0%. Limitations The sample size was relatively small and was collected from only one dermatologist's patient base; there was some degree of dermatopathologist interobserver variability; and only one confocalist performed the RCM image evaluations. Conclusion RCM is a useful adjunct during clinical assessment of in vivo lesions suspicious for melanoma or those requiring re-excision because of high level of dysplasia or having features consistent with an atypical melanocytic nevus with severe cytologic atypia. © 2016 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.","Mosby Inc.","Article","","Scopus"

The ill-posedness of the FMT inverse problem makes it difficult to reconstruct and resolve multiple adjacent fluorescent targets that have different functional features but are labeled with the same fluorochrome. An algorithm based on independent component analysis (ICA) for multispectral excited FMT is proposed to resolve multiple fluorescent targets in this study. Fluorescent targets are excited by multispectral excitation, and the three-dimensional distribution of fluorescent yields under the excitation spectrum is reconstructed by an iterative Tikhonov regularization algorithm. Subsequently, multiple fluorescent targets are resolved from mixed fluorescence signals by employing ICA. Simulations were performed and the results demonstrate that multiple adjacent fluorescent targets can be resolved if the number of excitation wavelengths is not smaller than that of fluorescent targets with different concentrations. The algorithm obtains both independent components that provide spatial information of different fluorescent targets and spectral courses that reflect variation trends of fluorescent yields along with the excitation spectrum. By using this method, it is possible to visualize the metabolism status of drugs in different structure organs, and quantitatively depict the variation trends of fluorescent yields of each functional organ under the excitation spectrum. This method may provide a pattern for tumor detection, drug delivery and treatment monitoring in vivo. © 2016 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

To determine the absolute concentrations of NADH in this phantom, the fluorescence emission spectra at 465 nm were corrected using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy between 600 nm and 940 nm. The patented autoclavable Nitinol needle probe enables the acquisition of multispectral backscattering measurements of ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared and fluorescence spectra. As a phantom, a suspension of calcium carbonate (Calcilit) and water with physiological NADH concentrations between 0 mmol l-1 and 2.0 mmol l-1 were used to mimic human tissue. The light scattering characteristics were adjusted to match the backscattering attributes of human skin by modifying the concentration of Calcilit. To correct the scattering effects caused by the matrices of the samples, an algorithm based on the backscattered remission spectrum was employed to compensate the influence of multiscattering on the optical pathway through the dispersed phase. The monitored backscattered visible light was used to correct the fluorescence spectra and thereby to determine the true NADH concentrations at unknown Calcilit concentrations. Despite the simplicity of the presented algorithm, the root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP) was 0.093 mmol l-1. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Institute of Physics Publishing","Article","","Scopus"

AcousticX is a linear array ultrasound transducer (128 elements, 10 MHz)-based system in which LED arrays (selectable wavelengths, pulse repetition frequency: 4 kHz, pulse width: tunable from 40 - 100 ns) are fixed on both sides of the transducer to illuminate the tissue for photoacoustic imaging. The ultrasound/photoacoustic data from all 128 elements can be simultaneously acquired, processed and displayed. We already demonstrated our system's capability to perform photoacoustic/ultrasound imaging for dynamic imaging of the tissue at a frame rate of 10 Hz (for example to visualize the pulsation of arteries in vivo in human subjects). In this work, we present the development of a new high-speed imaging mode in AcousticX. In this mode, instead of toggling between ultrasound and photoacoustic measurements, it is possible to continuously acquire only photoacoustic data for 1.5 seconds with a time interval of 1 ms. With this improvement, we can record photoacoustic signals from the whole aperture (38 mm) at fast rate and can be reviewed later at different speeds for analyzing dynamic changes in the photoacoustic signals. We believe that AcousticX with this new high-speed mode opens up a feasible technical path for multiple dynamic studies, for example one which focus on imaging the response of voltage sensitive dyes. We envisage to improve the acquisition speed further in future for exploring ultra-high-speed applications. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

Mortality is due to diagnosis of 75% of women with late stage disease, when metastasis is already present. EOC is characterized by diffuse and widely disseminated intra-peritoneal metastasis. Cells shed from the primary tumor anchor in the mesothelium that lines the peritoneal cavity as well as in the omentum, resulting in multi-focal metastasis, often in the presence of peritoneal ascites. Efforts in our laboratory are directed at a more detailed understanding of factors that regulate EOC metastatic success. However, quantifying metastatic tumor burden represents a significant technical challenge due to the large number, small size and broad distribution of lesions throughout the peritoneum. Herein we describe a method for analysis of EOC metastasis using cells labeled with red fluorescent protein (RFP) coupled with in vivo multispectral imaging. Following intraperitoneal injection of RFP-labelled tumor cells, mice are imaged weekly until time of sacrifice. At this time, the peritoneal cavity is surgically exposed and organs are imaged in situ. Dissected organs are then placed on a labeled transparent template and imaged ex vivo. Removal of tissue auto-fluorescence during image processing using multispectral unmixing enables accurate quantitation of relative tumor burden. This method has utility in a variety of applications including therapeutic studies to evaluate compounds that may inhibit metastasis and thereby improve overall survival. © 2016 Journal of Visualized Experiments.","Journal of Visualized Experiments","Article","","Scopus"

The mechanisms underlying neutrophil depletion are still under debate. Here, we examined how identical Ly6G antibodies coupled to different fluorochromes affect neutrophil fate in vivo. BM cells stained with Ly6G antibodies were injected into mice. The number of retrieved anti-Ly6G-FITC+ cells was reduced significantly in comparison with anti-Ly6G-APC+ or anti-Ly6G-PE+ cells. Flow cytometry and multispectral imaging flow cytometry analyses revealed that anti-Ly6G-FITC+ neutrophils were preferentially phagocytosed by BMMs in vitro and by splenic, hepatic, and BM macrophages in vivo. Direct antibody injection of anti-Ly6G-FITC but not anti-Ly6G-PE depleted neutrophils to the same degree as purified anti-Ly6G, indicating that the FITC-coupled antibody eliminates neutrophils by a similar mechanism as the uncoupled antibody. With the use of a protein G-binding assay, we demonstrated that APC and PE but not FITC coupling inhibited access to interaction sites on the anti-Ly6G antibody. We conclude the following: 1) that neutrophil phagocytosis by macrophages is a central mechanism in anti-Ly6G-induced neutrophil depletion and 2) that fluorochrome-coupling can affect functional properties of anti-Ly6G antibodies, thereby modifying macrophage uptake of Ly6G-labeled neutrophils and neutrophil retrieval following adoptive cell transfer or injection of fluorescent anti-Ly6G. © Society for Leukocyte Biology.","Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","Article","","Scopus"

Using these probes in conjunction with multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) is a promising approach to improve imaging for pancreatic cancer. Methods: A pH-sensitive pHLIP (V7) was conjugated to 750 NIR fluorescent dye and evaluated as a targeted probe for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The pH-insensitive K7 pHLIP served as an untargeted control. Probe binding was assessed in vitro at pH 7.4, 6.8, and 6.6 using human pancreatic cell lines S2VP10 and S2013. Using MSOT, semiquantitative probe accumulation was then assessed in vivo with a murine orthotopic pancreatic adenocarcinoma model. Results: In vitro, the V7-750 probe demonstrated significantly higher fluorescence at pH 6.6 compared with pH 7.4 (S2VP10, P = 0.0119; S2013, P = 0.0160), whereas no difference was observed with the K7-750 control (S2VP10, P = 0.8783; S2013, P = 0.921). In the in vivo S2VP10 model, V7-750 probe resulted in 782.5 MSOT a.u. signal compared with 5.3 MSOT a.u. in K7-750 control in tumor (P = 0.0001). Similarly, V7-750 probe signal was 578.3MSOT a.u. in the S2013 model compared with K7-750 signal at 5.1 MSOT a.u. (P = 0.0005). There was minimal off-Target accumulation of the V7-750 probe within the liver or kidney, and probe distribution was confirmed with ex vivo imaging. Conclusions: Compared with pH-insensitive controls, V7-750 pH-sensitive probe specifically targets pancreatic adenocarcinoma and has minimal off-Target accumulation.

The purpose of the study was to develop a tumor-targeted theranostic nanovehicle for pancreatic cancer detectable by multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT). To improve the tumor specificity of our mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN), we utilized a dual targeting strategy: 1) an elevated tumor receptor, urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (UPAR), and 2) the acidic tumor microenvironment. The tumor specificity of the MSN particle was improved with the addition of both chitosan, targeting acidic pH, and urokinase plasminogen activator (UPA), targeting UPAR. Drug release assays confirmed pH responsive release of gemcitabine in vitro. The UPAR specific binding of MSN-UPA nanoparticles was confirmed by reduction in fluorescence signal following MSN-UPA nanoparticle treatment in UPAR positive cells blocked with a UPAR-blocking antibody. Based upon Indocyanine Green encapsulation within the nanoparticles, UPA ligand targeted MSNs demonstrated increased intensity compared to untargeted MSNs at both pH 7.4 (7 ×) and 6.5 (20 ×); however the signal was much more pronounced at a pH of 6.5 using tissue phantoms (p < 0.05).

In colorectal surgery, detecting ureters and mesenteric arteries is of utmost importance to prevent iatrogenic injury and to facilitate intraoperative decision making. A tool enabling ureter- and artery-specific image enhancement within (and possibly through) surrounding adipose tissue would facilitate this need, especially during laparoscopy. To evaluate the potential of hyperspectral imaging in colorectal surgery, we explored spectral tissue signatures using single-spot diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). As hyperspectral cameras with silicon (Si) and indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) sensor chips are becoming available, we investigated spectral distinctive features for both sensor ranges. Methods. In vivo wide-band (wavelength range 350-1830 nm) DRS was performed during open colorectal surgery. From the recorded spectra, 36 features were extracted at predefined wavelengths: 18 gradients and 18 amplitude differences. For classification of respectively ureter and artery in relation to surrounding adipose tissue, the best distinctive feature was selected using binary logistic regression for Si- and InGaAs-sensor spectral ranges separately. Classification performance was evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation. Results. In 10 consecutive patients, 253 spectra were recorded on 53 tissue sites (including colon, adipose tissue, muscle, artery, vein, ureter). Classification of ureter versus adipose tissue revealed accuracy of 100% for both Si range and InGaAs range. Classification of artery versus surrounding adipose tissue revealed accuracies of 95% (Si) and 89% (InGaAs). Conclusions.

Light is subject to both absorption and scattering when traveling through tissue; adequate knowledge of tissue optical properties and hence the spatial fluence distribution is required to create an optoacoustic image that is directly proportional to chromophore concentrations at all depths. Using data from a commercial multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) system, we implemented an iterative optimization for fluence correction based on a finite-element implementation of the delta-Eddington approximation to the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE). We demonstrate a linear relationship between the image intensity and absorption coefficients across multiple wavelengths and depths in phantoms. We also demonstrate improved feature visibility and spectral recovery at depth in phantoms and with in vivo measurements, suggesting our approach could in the future enable quantitative extraction of tissue absorption coefficients in biological tissue. © 1982-2012 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

We studied the optical properties of cervical tissue to determine multi-wavelengths for different imaging modalities. Advanced algorithms based on the second derivative spectrum and the fluorescence intensity were developed to differentiate cervical tissue into two categories: squamous normal (SN) and high grade (HG) dysplasia.

Ultrasound imaging is widely used as a guidance modality to visualize anatomical structures in real-time. However, identification of nerves and small blood vessels can be very challenging, and accidental intra-neural or intra-vascular injections can result in significant complications. Multi-spectral photoacoustic imaging can provide high sensitivity and specificity for discriminating hemoglobin-and lipid-rich tissues. However, conventional surface-illumination-based photoacoustic systems suffer from limited sensitivity at large depths. In this study, for the first time, an interventional multispectral photoacoustic imaging (IMPA) system was used to image nerves in a swine model in vivo. Pulsed excitation light with wavelengths in the ranges of 750-900 nm and 1150-1300 nm was delivered inside the body through an optical fiber positioned within the cannula of an injection needle. Ultrasound waves were received at the tissue surface using a clinical linear array imaging probe. Co-registered B-mode ultrasound images were acquired using the same imaging probe. Nerve identification was performed using a combination of B-mode ultrasound imaging and electrical stimulation. Using a linear model, spectral-unmixing of the photoacoustic data was performed to provide image contrast for oxygenated and de-oxygenated hemoglobin, water and lipids. Good correspondence between a known nerve location and a lipid-rich region in the photoacoustic images was observed. The results indicate that IMPA is a promising modality for guiding nerve blocks and other interventional procedures.

Opportunities for the application of imaging and automation in the screening process exist in settings where resources are limited. Methods: Patients with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) underwent imaging with a Multispectral Digital Colposcopy (MDC) prior to have a loop excision of the cervix. The image taken with white light was annotated by a clinician. The excised specimen was mapped by the study histopathologist blinded to the MDC data. This map was used to define areas of high grade in the excised tissue. Eleven reviewers mapped the histopathologic data into the MDC images. The reviewers’ maps were analyzed and areas of agreement were calculated. We compared the result of a boosted tree classifier with a previously developed ensemble classifier. Results: Using a boosted tree classifier we obtained a sensitivity of 95%, a specificity of 96%, and an accuracy of 96% on the training sets. When we applied the classifier to a test set, we obtained a sensitivity of 82%, a specificity of 81%, and an accuracy of 81%. The boosted tree classifier performed better than the previously developed ensemble classifier. Conclusion: Here we presented promising results which show that a boosted tree analysis on MDC images is a method that could be used as an adjunct to colposcopy and would result in greater diagnostic accuracy compared to existing methods.

Multiplexed readout from targets, such as cell surface receptors overexpressed in cancer cells, could improve both sensitivity and specificity of tumor identification. There remains, however, a need for compact and cost effective implementations of the technology. We have implemented a low-cost wide-field multiplexed fluorescence imaging system, which combines LED excitation at 590, 655 and 740 nm with a compact commercial solid state HSI system operating in the range 600-1000 nm. A key challenge for using reflectance-based HSI is the separation of contrast agent fluorescence from the reflectance of the excitation light. Here, we illustrate how it is possible to address this challenge in software, using two offline reflectance removal methods, prior to least-squares spectral unmixing. We made a quantitative comparison of the methods using data acquired from dilutions of contrast agents prepared in well-plates. We then established the capability of our HSI system for non-invasive in vivo fluorescence imaging in small animals using the optimal reflectance removal method. The HSI presented here enables quantitative unmixing of at least four fluorescent contrast agents (Alexa Fluor 610, 647, 700 and 750) simultaneously in living mice. A successful unmixing of the four fluorescent contrast agents was possible both using the pure contrast agents and with mixtures. The system could in principle also be applied to imaging of ex vivo tissue or intraoperative imaging in a clinical setting. These data suggest a promising approach for developing clinical applications of HSI based on multiplexed fluorescence contrast agent imaging. © 2016 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

An injectable thermosensitive hydrogel based on a four-arm poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-poly(Îμ -Caprolactone) (PCL) copolymer was prepared and characterized with a zinc phthalocyanine core as the drug carrier.

Methods: Cu2MnS2 NPs were synthesized through a facile and environmentally friendly process. A series of experiments, including the characterization of Cu2MnS2 NPs, the long-term toxicity of Cu2MnS2 NPs in BALB/c nude mice, the applications of Cu2MnS2 NPs for in vitro and in vivo MRI/MSOT dual-modal imaging and NIR-II PTT of cancer were carried out. Results: The as-synthesized Cu2MnS2 NPs exhibit low cytotoxicity, excellent biocompatibility as well as high photothermal conversion efficiency (~49.38%) and outstanding photostability. Together with their good T1-shortening effect and strong absorbance in the NIR-I and NIR-II region, the Cu2MnS2 NPs display high-contrast imaging performance both in MRI and MSOT (900 nm laser source). Moreover, the subsequent in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that the Cu2MnS2 NPs possess excellent PTT efficacy under 1064 nm laser irradiation with a low power density (0.6 W cm-2). In addition, the detailed long-term toxicity studies further confirming the safety of Cu2MnS2 NPs in vivo.

These new materials meet important prerequisites as relevant to biological processes: they are minimally toxic to living cells and retain structural integrity in water and phosphate-buffered saline.

Novel advanced direct visualization techniques that require less time, cost, and resource investment than electron microscopy (EM) are needed for identifying and locating ENMs in biological samples. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) combines spectrophotometry and imaging, using advanced optics and algorithms to capture a spectrum from 400 to 1000 nm at each pixel in an enhanced dark-field microscopic (EDFM) image. HSI-EDFM can be used to confirm the identity of the materials of interest in a sample and generate an image ""mapping"" their presence and location in a sample. Hyperspectral mapping is particularly important for biological samples, where ENM morphology is visually indistinct from surrounding tissue structures. While use of HSI (without mapping) is increasing, no studies to date have compared results from hyperspectral mapping with conventional methods. Thus, the objective of this study was to utilize EDFM-HSI to locate, identify, and map metal oxide ENMs in ex vivo histological porcine skin tissues, a toxicological model of cutaneous exposure, and compare findings with those of Raman spectroscopy (RS), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results demonstrate that EDFM-HSI mapping is capable of locating and identifying ENMs in tissue, as confirmed by conventional methods. This study serves as initial confirmation of EDFM-HSI mapping as a novel and higher throughput technique for ENM identification in biological samples, and serves as the basis for further protocol development utilizing EDFM-HSI for semiquantitation of ENMs. Microsc.

Many synthetic polymers have already been synthesized for targeted tumor therapy, but potential advantages of these carbohydrates include inexpensive synthesis, constant availability, a good safety profile, biodegradability and the long clinical use as plasma expanders. Three polymers have been tested for cytotoxicity and cytokine activation in cell cultures and conjugated with a near-infrared fluorescent dye: hydroxyethyl starches (HES 200 kDa and HES 450 kDa) and dextran (DEX 500 kDa). Particle size and molecular weight distribution were determined by asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4). The biodistribution was investigated non-invasively in nude mice using multispectral optical imaging. The most promising polymer conjugate was characterized in human colon carcinoma xenograft bearing nude mice. A tumor specific accumulation of HES 450 was observed, which proves it's potential as carrier for passive tumor targeting.","","Article","","Scopus"

Since existing imaging models are incapable of quantifying the vascular response to biomaterial implants after transplantation, in this study, we demonstrate the use of invivo laser speckle imaging (LSI) and wide-field functional imaging (WiFI) to monitor the microvascular environment surrounding biomaterial implants. The vascular response to two islet-containing biomaterial encapsulation devices, alginate microcapsules and a high-guluronate alginate sheet, was studied and compared after implantation into the mouse dorsal window chamber (N=4 per implant group). Images obtained over a 14-day period using LSI and WiFI were analyzed using algorithms to quantify blood flow, hemoglobin oxygen saturation and vascular density. Using our method, we were able to monitor the changes in the peri-implant microvasculature noninvasively without the use of fluorescent dyes. Significant changes in blood flow, hemoglobin oxygen saturation and vascular density were noted as early as the first week post-transplant. The dorsal window chamber model enables comparison of host responses to transplanted biomaterials.

While several studies have elucidated cross-midline perfusion, further characterization of perfusion to the ipsilateral hemiabdomen is necessary for minimizing rates of fat necrosis or partial fat necrosis in bilateral DIEP flaps. Eighteen patients (29 flaps) underwent DIEP flap harvest using a prospectively designed protocol. Perforators were marked and imaged with a novel system for quantitatively measuring tissue oxygenation, the Digital Light Hyperspectral Imager. Images were then analyzed to determine if perforator selection influenced ipsilateral flap perfusion. Flaps based on a single lateral row perforator (SLRP) were found to have a higher level of hemoglobin oxygenation in Zone I (mean %HbO2 = 76.1) compared to single medial row perforator (SMRP) flaps (%HbO2 = 71.6). Perfusion of Zone III relative to Zone I was similar between SLRP and SMRP flaps (97.4% vs. 97.9%, respectively). These differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05). Perfusion to the lateral edge of the flap was slightly greater for SLRP flaps compared SMRP flaps (92.1% vs. 89.5%, respectively). SMRP flaps had superior perfusion travelling inferiorly compared to SLRP flaps (88.8% vs. 83.9%, respectively). Overall, it was observed that flaps were better perfused in the lateral direction than inferiorly. Significant differences in perfusion gradients directed inferiorly or laterally were observed, and perforator selection influenced perfusion in the most distal or inferior aspects of the flap. This suggests broader clinical implications for flap design that merit further investigation. © 2013 SPIE.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

TPEF can take advantage of the autofluorescence of molecules intrinsically contained in a biological tissue, as such NADH, elastin, collagen, and flavins. Two-photon microscopy has been already successfully used to image several types of tissues, including skin, muscles, tendons, bladder. Nevertheless, its usefulness in imaging colon tissue has not been deeply investigated yet. In this work we have used combined two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF), second harmonic generation microscopy (SHG), fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and multispectral two-photon emission detection (MTPE) to investigate different kinds of human ex-vivo fresh biopsies of colon. Morphological and spectroscopic analyses allowed to characterize both healthy mucosa, polyp, and colon samples in a good agreement with common routine histology. Even if further analysis, as well as a more significant statistics on a large number of samples would be helpful to discriminate between low, mild, and high grade cancer, our method is a promising tool to be used as diagnostic confirmation of histological results, as well as a diagnostic tool in a multiphoton endoscope or colonoscope to be used in in-vivo imaging applications. © 2012 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

With the recent emergence of methods appropriate for in vivo staining, such as bioluminescence, fluorescent molecular probes, and proteins, as well as nanoparticle-based targeted agents, significant attention has been shifted toward in vivo interrogations of different dynamic biological processes at the molecular level. This progress has been largely supported by the development of advanced optical tomographic imaging technologies suitable for obtaining volumetric visualization of biomarker distributions in small animals at a whole-body or whole-organ scale, an imaging frontier that is not accessible by the existing tissue-sectioning microscopic techniques due to intensive light scattering beyond the depth of a few hundred microns. Biomedical optoacoustics has also emerged in the recent decade as a powerful tool for high-resolution visualization of optical contrast, overcoming a variety of longstanding limitations imposed by light scattering in deep tissues. By detecting tiny sound vibrations, resulting from selective absorption of light at multiple wavelengths, multispectral optoacoustic tomography methods can now ""hear color"" in three dimensions, i.e., deliver volumetric spectrally enriched (color) images from deep living tissues at high spatial resolution and in real time.

Here, the impact of the structure of the acid-labile spacer between the drug and the polymer carrier on the biodistribution of both the drug and the carrier was studied using in vivo noninvasive multispectral optical imaging of dual fluorescently labeled HPMA copolymers. Five different spacers containing a pH-sensitive hydrazone bond were synthesized and used to combine a fluorescent model drug with a polymer backbone, conjugated with another non-releasable fluorescent dye. Two copolymers differing in polymer chain structure (linear and star-like) and molecular weight (30 and 200 kDa) were used to distinguish between carriers with molecular weights above and below the limit for renal filtration. The rate of model drug release from the conjugates was determined in vitro. The biodistributions of the six most promising conjugates were investigated in vivo in athymic nude mice inoculated with human colon carcinoma xenograft. The structure of the spacer in the vicinity of the hydrazone bond significantly influenced the release rate of the model drug. The slow release rate of a pyridyl group bearing spacer resulted in a greater amount of the model drug being transported to the tumor, which was independent of the carrier structure. The results of this study emphasize the importance of careful selection of the structure and appropriate spacer when designing polymer conjugates intended for passive tumor targeting. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","","Article","","Scopus"

Here, we present, for the first time, a method combining SFDI with unstructured (zero spatial frequency) illumination to extract tissue absorption and scattering properties over a wavelength range (850 to 1800 nm) largely unexplored by previous tissue optics techniques. To obtain images over this wavelength range, we employ a SWIR camera in conjunction with an SFDI system. We use SFDI to obtain in vivo tissue reduced scattering coefficients at the wavelengths from 850 to 1050 nm, and then use unstructured wide-field illumination and an extrapolated power-law fit to this scattering spectrum to extract the absorption spectrum from 850 to 1800 nm. Our proof-of-principle experiment in a rat burn model illustrates that the combination of multispectral SWIR imaging, SFDI, and unstructured illumination can characterize in vivo changes in skin optical properties over a greatly expanded wavelength range. In the rat burn experiment, these changes (relative to normal, unburned skin) included increased absorption and increased scattering amplitude and slope, consistent with changes that we previously reported in the near-infrared using SFDI. © The Authors.","","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Current techniques are often complicated by tumor heterogeneity. Herein, a novel in vivo approach that combines 19F magnetic resonance imaging (19F-MRI) R1 mapping with diffusionbased multispectral (MS) analysis is introduced. This approach restricts the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) measurements to viable tumor, the tissue of therapeutic interest. The technique exhibited sufficient sensitivity to detect a breathing gas challenge in a xenograft tumor model, and the hypoxic region measured by MS 19F-MRI was strongly correlated with histologic estimates of hypoxia. This approach was then applied to address the effects of antivascular agents on tumor oxygenation, which is a research question that is still under debate. The technique was used to monitor longitudinal pO2 changes in response to an antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (B20.4.1.1) and a selective dual phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (GDC-0980). GDC-0980 reduced viable tumor pO2 during a 3-day treatment period, and a significant reduction was also produced by B20.4.1.1. Overall, this method provides an unprecedented view of viable tumor pO2 and contributes to a greater understanding of the effects of antivascular therapies on the tumor's microenvironment. © 2013 Neoplasia Press, Inc.

Using the resultant absorbance spectrum as a response variable and the extinction coefficients of melanin, oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin as predictor variables, multiple regression analysis provides regression coefficients.

Successful analysis of separate cell populations or signaling events by intravital microscopy requires optimal pairing of multiphoton excitation wavelengths with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. While prior studies have analyzed two photon absorption properties of isolated fluorescent proteins, there is limited information about two photon excitation and fluorescence emission profiles of fluorescent proteins expressed in living cells and intact tissues. Multiphoton microscopy was used to analyze fluorescence outputs of multiple blue, green, and red fluorescent proteins in cultured cells and orthotopic tumor xenografts of human breast cancer cells. It is shown that commonly used orange and red fluorescent proteins are excited efficiently by 750 to 760 nm laser light in living cells, enabling dual color imaging studies with blue or cyan proteins without changing excitation wavelength. It is also shown that small incremental changes in excitation wavelength significantly affect emission intensities from fluorescent proteins, which can be used to optimize multi-color imaging using a single laser wavelength.

Methods: Wide band (440-1830 nm) spectra were collected using an optical fiber probe and spectrometer from freshly explanted, ex vivo, human colonic specimens. These data were normalized at 810 nm (an isobestic wavelength for hemoglobin and oxy-hemoglobin) and mathematically analyzed using total principal component regression (TPCR). Results: 929 spectra were collected from specimens of 19 patients, distinguishing 5 tissue types: mesenteric fat (MF, n = 269), blood vessels (BV, n = 377), colonic tissue (CT, n = 213), ureter (UR, n = 10) and tumorous tissue in colon (TT, n = 60). For each individual tissue type the distinctive ability was determined against all other tissue types pooled as a group. Paired probability density function (PDF) of ""tissue"" (centered around label 1) versus ""all other pooled tissues"" (centered around label 0) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) at label crossover value 0.5 was determined for each tissue type (MF: CDF = 0.99 [SD = 0.19]; BV: CDF = 0.95 [SD = 0.29]; CT: CDF = 0.98 [SD = 0.22]; UR: CDF = 0.99 [SD = 0.09]; TT: CDF = 0.99 [SD = 0.18]).

Interrupting any of these phases may result in chronically unhealed wounds, amputation, or even patient death. Despite the clinical significance in chronic wound management, no effective methods have been developed for quantitative image-guided treatment. We integrated a multimodal imaging system with a cold atmospheric plasma probe for image-guided treatment of chronic wound. Multimodal imaging system offers a non-invasive, painless, simultaneous and quantitative assessment of cutaneous wound healing. Cold atmospheric plasma accelerates the wound healing process through many mechanisms including decontamination, coagulation and stimulation of the wound healing. The therapeutic effect of cold atmospheric plasma is studied in vivo under the guidance of a multimodal imaging system. Cutaneous wounds are created on the dorsal skin of the nude mice. During the healing process, the sample wound is treated by cold atmospheric plasma at different controlled dosage, while the control wound is healed naturally. The multimodal imaging system integrating a multispectral imaging module and a laser speckle imaging module is used to collect the information of cutaneous tissue oxygenation (i.e. oxygen saturation, StO2) and blood perfusion simultaneously to assess and guide the plasma therapy. Our preliminary tests show that cold atmospheric plasma in combination with multimodal imaging guidance has the potential to facilitate the healing of chronic wounds.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Among vertebrates, zebrafish is uniquely suited for in vivo imaging owing to its small size and optical translucency. However, distinguishing and following cells over extended time periods remains difficult. Previous studies have demonstrated that Cre recombinase-mediated recombination can lead to combinatorial expression of spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins (RFP, YFP and CFP) in neighboring cells, creating a 'Brainbow' of colors. The random combination of fluorescent proteins provides a way to distinguish adjacent cells, visualize cellular interactions and perform lineage analyses. Here, we describe Zebrabow (Zebrafish Brainbow) tools for in vivo multicolor imaging in zebrafish. First, we show that the broadly expressed ubi:Zebrabow line provides diverse color profiles that can be optimized by modulating Cre activity. Second, we find that colors are inherited equally among daughter cells and remain stable throughout embryonic and larval stages. Third, we show that UAS:Zebrabow lines can be used in combination with Gal4 to generate broad or tissue-specific expression patterns and facilitate tracing of axonal processes. Fourth, we demonstrate that Zebrabow can be used for long-term lineage analysis. Using the cornea as a model system, we provide evidence that embryonic corneal epithelial clones are replaced by large, wedge-shaped clones formed by centripetal expansion of cells from the peripheral cornea.

However, mouse CSF drainage into lymphatics has not been thoroughly characterized. We aimed to image this using an in vivo approach that combined quantum dot fluorescent nanoparticles with hyperspectral imaging.Findings: Quantum dot 655 was injected into the CSF of the cisterna magna in seven mice and visualized by in vivo hyperspectral imaging at time points 20 and 40 min, 1, 2, and 6 h after injection. In controls (n = 4), quantum dots were applied directly onto intact dura mater covering the cisterna magna. After imaging, lymph nodes in the neck were harvested and processed post-mortem for histological analysis. After injection into the CSF, quantum dot signal was detected in vivo in submandibular lymph nodes of all mice studied as early as 20 min, but not in controls. Post-mortem gross and histological examination of lymph nodes confirmed in vivo observations.Conclusions: Non-invasive in vivo hyperspectral imaging is a useful tool to study CSF lymphatic drainage and is relevant to understanding this pathway in CNS disease models. © 2013 Mathieu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Sensitivity is limited, especially in the visible spectral range, by the presence of ubiquitous autofluorescence signals (mostly arising from the skin and gut), which need to be separated from those of targeted fluorophores. Fluorescence-based imaging is also affected by absorbing and scattering properties of tissue in both the visible and to a lesser extent the near-infrared (NIR) regions. However, the small size of typical animal models (usually mice) often permits the detection of enough light arising even from relatively deep locations to allow the capture of signals with an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio. Multispectral imaging, through its ability to separate autofluorescence from label fluorescence, can increase sensitivity as much as 300 times compared to conventional approaches, and concomitantly improve quantitative accuracy. In the NIR region, autofluo-rescence, while still significant, poses less of a problem. However, the task of disentangling signals from multiple fluorophores remains. Multispectral imaging allows the separation of five or more fluorophores, with each signal quantitated and visualized separately. Preclinical small animal imaging is often accompanied by microscopic analysis, both before and after the in vivo phase. This can involve tissue culture manipulations and/or histological examination of fixed or frozen tissue. Due to the same advantages in sensitivity, quantitation, and multiplexing, microscopy-based multispectral techniques form an excellent complement to in vivo imaging.","","Article","","Scopus"

We use deconvolution for spatially varying kernels to process multispectral information obtained by using a novel laparoscopic imaging device. The trinocular design of the system allows visible light images provide information about the tissue morphology and motion that we use to construct a per pixel deformation map.

Tumor hypoxia has been associated with a poor clinical outcome and plays a critical role in tumor radioresistance. Recent Advances: Two main types of hypoxia exist in the tumor microenvironment: chronic and cycling hypoxia. Chronic hypoxia results from the limited diffusion distance of oxygen, and cycling hypoxia primarily results from the variation in microvessel red blood cell flux and temporary disturbances in perfusion. Chronic hypoxia may cause either tumor progression or regressive effects depending on the tumor model. However, there is a general trend toward the development of a more aggressive phenotype after cycling hypoxia. With advanced hypoxia imaging techniques, spatiotemporal characteristics of tumor hypoxia and the changes to the tumor microenvironment can be analyzed. Critical Issues: In this review, we focus on the biological and clinical consequences of chronic and cycling hypoxia on radiation treatment. We also discuss the advanced non-invasive imaging techniques that have been developed to detect and monitor tumor hypoxia in preclinical and clinical studies. Future Directions: A better understanding of the mechanisms of tumor hypoxia with non-invasive imaging will provide a basis for improved radiation therapeutic practices. Antioxid.

To address this need, non-invasive, quantitative optical imaging techniques were developed to assess the timecourse of recovery in the mouse HLI model. Hyperspectral imaging and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were used to non-invasively image hemoglobin oxygen saturation and microvessel morphology plus blood flow, respectively, in the anesthetized mouse after induction of HLI. Hyperspectral imaging detected significant increases in hemoglobin saturation in the ischemic paw as early as 3 days after femoral artery ligation (P < 0.01), and significant increases in distal blood flow were first detected with OCT 14 days postsurgery (P < 0.01). Intravital OCT images of the adductor muscle vasculature revealed corkscrew collateral vessels characteristic of the arteriogenic response to HLI. The hyperspectral imaging and OCT data significantly correlated with each other and with laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) and tissue oxygenation sensor data (P < 0.01). However, OCT measurements acquired depth-resolved information and revealed more sustained flow deficits following surgery that may be masked by more superficial measurements (LDPI, hyperspectral imaging). Therefore, intravital OCT may provide a robust biomarker for the late stages of ischemic limb recovery. This work validates non-invasive acquisition of both functional and morphological data with hyperspectral imaging and OCT. Together, these techniques provide cardiovascular researchers an unprecedented and comprehensive view of the temporal dynamics of HLI recovery in living mice. © 2013 the American Physiological Society.","","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Cell-based therapies are highly promising strategies for GLD. In this study, G-Olig2 mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) were induced into oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and were implanted into the brains of twitcher mice, an animal model of GLD, to explore the therapeutic potential of the cells. Methods: The G-Olig2 ESCs were induced into OPCs by using cytokines and a multi-step differentiation procedure. Oligodendrocyte markers were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunocytochemistry. The toxicity of psychosine to OPCs was determined by a cell proliferation assay kit. The GALC level of OPCs was also examined. OPCs were labeled with Dir and transplanted into the brains of twitcher mice. The transplanted cells were detected by in-Vivo Multispectral Imaging System and real-time PCR. The physiological effects of twitcher mice were assessed. Results: Oligodendrocyte markers were expressed in OPCs, and 76%∈±∈5.76% of the OPCs were enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-positive, eGFP was driven by the Olig2 promoter. The effect of psychosine on cell viability indicated that OPCs were more resistant to psychosine toxicity. The GALC level of OPCs was 10.0∈±∈1.23 nmol/hour per mg protein, which was significantly higher than other cells. Dir-labeled OPCs were injected into the forebrain of post-natal day 10 twitcher mice. The transplanted OPCs were myelin basic protein (MBP)-positive and remained along the injection tract as observed by fluorescent microscopy. The level of the Dir fluorescent signal and eGFP mRNA significantly decreased at days 10 and 20 after injection, as indicated by in-Vivo Multispectral Imaging System and real-time PCR. Because of poor cell survival and limited migration ability, there was no significant improvement in brain GALC activity, MBP level, life span, body weight, and behavioral deficits of twitcher mice. Conclusions: ESC-derived OPC transplantation was not sufficient to reverse the clinical course of GLD in twitcher mice. © 2015 Kuai et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

By combining the techniques of hyperspectral imaging and a dorsal skinfold window chamber, this method enabled the real-time monitoring of vascular transport and tissue deposition of nanoparticles labeled with near-infrared (NIR) dye. Using this imaging method, we quantified the delivery pharmacokinetics of the native high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted HDL nanoparticles and demonstrated these HDLs had long circulation time in blood stream (half-life >12 h). These HDL nanoparticles could efficiently carry cargo DiR-BOA to extravasate from blood vessels, diffuse through extracellular matrix, and penetrate and be retained in the tumor site. The EGFR targeting specificity of EGFR-targeted HDL (EGFR-specific peptide conjugated HDL) was also visualized in vivo by competitive inhibition with excess EGFR-specific peptide. In summary, this imaging technology may help point the way toward the development of novel imaging-based pharmacokinetic assays for preclinical drugs and evaluation of drug delivery efficiency, providing a dynamic window into the development and application of novel drug delivery systems. © World Scientific Publishing Company.","","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Invasive extraction of cells from a living organism, however, may lead to changes in cell properties and prevents the long-term study of cells in their native environment. Here, we summarize recent advances of new generation flow cytometry for in vivo noninvasive label-free or targeted detection of cells in blood, lymph, bone, cerebral and plant vasculatures using photoacoustic (PA) detection techniques, multispectral high-pulse-repetition-rate lasers, tunable ultrasharp (up to 0.8. nm) rainbow plasmonic nanoprobes, positive and negative PA contrasts, in vivo magnetic enrichment, time-of-flight cell velocity measurement, PA spectral analysis, and integration of PA, photothermal (PT), fluorescent, and Raman methods. Unique applications of this tool are reviewed with a focus on ultrasensitive detection of normal blood cells at different functional states (e.g., apoptotic and necrotic) and rare abnormal cells including circulating tumor cells (CTCs), cancer stem cells, pathogens, clots, sickle cells as well as pharmokinetics of nanoparticles, dyes, microbubbles and drug nanocarriers. Using this tool we discovered that palpation, biopsy, or surgery can enhance CTC release from primary tumors, increasing the risk of metastasis. The novel fluctuation flow cytometry provided the opportunity for the dynamic study of blood rheology including red blood cell aggregation and clot formation in different medical conditions (e.g., blood disorders, cancer, or surgery). Theranostics, as a combination of PA diagnosis and PT nanobubble-amplified multiplex therapy, was used for eradication of CTCs, purging of infected blood, and thrombolysis of clots using PA guidance to control therapy efficiency. In vivo flow cytometry using a portable fiber-based devices can provide a breakthrough platform for early diagnosis of cancer, infection and cardiovascular disorders with a potential to inhibit, if not prevent, metastasis, sepsis, and strokes or heart attack by well-timed personalized therapy. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","","Review","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Pixel-wise estimates of the mucosal blood volume fraction, density of the scattering particles and thickness were derived using a two-stage method. In the first (forward) stage reflectance spectra corresponding to given instances of the parameter values were computed using Monte Carlo simulation of photon propagation through a multi-layered tissue. In the second (inversion) stage the parameter values were obtained via optimization using an iterated conditional modes algorithm based on Discrete Markov Random Fields. The method was validated on computer generated data contaminated with noise giving a mean normalized root mean square deviation (NRMSD) of 2.04. Validation on ex vivo images demonstrated that parametric maps show gross correspondence with histological features of mucosa characteristic of cancerous, precancerous and noncancerous colon lesions.

The mutations cause undersulfation of glycosaminoglycans in cartilage. Studies of dtd mice with a knock-in Slc26a2 mutation showed an unusual progression of the disorder: net undersulfation is mild and normalizing with age, but the articular cartilage degrades with age and bones develop abnormally. To understand underlying mechanisms, we studied newborn dtd mice. We developed, verified and used high-definition infrared hyperspectral imaging of cartilage sections at physiological conditions, to quantify collagen and its orientation, noncollagenous proteins, and chondroitin chains, and their sulfation with 6-μm spatial resolution and without labeling.Wefound that chondroitin sulfation across the proximal femur cartilage varied dramatically in dtd, but not in the wild type. Corresponding undersulfation of dtd was mild in most regions, but strong in narrow articular and growth plate regions crucial for bone development. This undersulfation correlated with the chondroitin synthesis rate measured via radioactive sulfate incorporation, explaining the sulfation normalization with age. Collagen orientation was reduced, and the reduction correlated with chondroitin undersulfation. Such disorientation involved the layer of collagen covering the articular surface and protecting cartilage from degradation. Malformation of this layer may contribute to the degradation progression with age and to collagen and proteoglycan depletion from the articular region, which we observed in mice already at birth. The results provide clues to in vivo sulfation, DTD treatment, and cartilage growth. © 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.","","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

This work intends to characterize the polarimetric response of the uterine cervix in its healthy and pathological states.

These quantities can be estimated from the contribution of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin to the absorption spectrum of the dermis. However, estimation of blood related absorption in skin can be confounded by the strong absorption of melanin in the epidermis and epidermal thickness and pigmentation varies with anatomic location, race, gender, and degree of disease progression. Therefore, a method is desired that decouples the effect of melanin absorption in the epidermis from blood absorption in the dermis for a large range of skin types and thicknesses. A previously developed inverse method based on a neural network forward model was applied to simulated spatial frequency domain reflectance of skin for multiple wavelengths in the near infrared. It is demonstrated that the optical thickness of the epidermis and absorption and reduced scattering coefficients of the dermis can be determined independently and with minimal coupling. Then, the same inverse method was applied to reflectance measurements from a tissue simulating phantom and in vivo human skin. Oxygen saturation and total hemoglobin concentrations were estimated from the volar forearms of weakly and strongly pigmented subjects using a standard homogeneous model and the present two layer model. © 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The algorithm is based on a forward model of light transport in multilayered skin tissue and an inverse algorithm for StO2 reconstruction. Based on the forward simulation results, a parameter of a second derivative ratio (SDR) is derived as a function of cutaneous tissue StO2. The SDR function is optimized at a wavelength set of 544, 552, 568, 576, 592, and 600 nm so that cutaneous tissue StO2 can be derived with minimal artifacts by blood concentration, tissue scattering, and melanin concentration. The proposed multispectral StO2 imaging algorithm is verified in both benchtop and in vivo experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed multispectral imaging algorithm is able to map cutaneous tissue StO2 in high temporal resolution with reduced measurement artifacts induced by different skin conditions in comparison with other three commercial tissue oxygen measurement systems. These results indicate that the multispectral StO2 imaging technique has the potential for noninvasive and quantitative assessment of skin tissue oxygenation with a high temporal resolution. © 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","SPIE","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Conventionally, multispectral information and diffusion theory were introduced to achieve whole-body tomographic reconstruction. However, the diffusion theory inevitably causes systematic error in blue bands of the electromagnetic spectrum due to high-tissue absorption, and CL has a blue-weighted broad spectrum. Therefore, it is challenging to improve the accuracy of CLT. The performance of the n-order simplified spherical harmonics approximation (SPn) in different spectra is evaluated, and a multispectral hybrid CLT based on the combination of different SPn models is proposed to handle the Cerenkov photon transport problem in complex media. The in vivo xenograft experiment shows that this approach can effectively improve the quality and accuracy of the reconstructed light source.

However, many existing clinical practices and multimodal imaging systems are subjective, qualitative, sequential for multimodal data collection, and need co-registration between different modalities. To overcome these limitations, we developed a multimodal imaging system for quantitative, non-invasive, and simultaneous imaging of cutaneous tissue oxygenation and blood perfusion parameters. The imaging system integrated multispectral and laser speckle imaging technologies into one experimental setup. A Labview interface was developed for equipment control, synchronization, and image acquisition. Advanced algorithms based on a wide gap second derivative reflectometry and laser speckle contrast analysis (LASCA) were developed for accurate reconstruction of tissue oxygenation and blood perfusion respectively. Quantitative calibration experiments and a new style of skinsimulating phantom were designed to verify the accuracy and reliability of the imaging system. The experimental results were compared with a Moor tissue oxygenation and perfusion monitor. For In vivo testing, a post-occlusion reactive hyperemia (PORH) procedure in human subject and an ongoing wound healing monitoring experiment using dorsal skinfold chamber models were conducted to validate the usability of our system for dynamic detection of oxygenation and perfusion parameters. In this study, we have not only setup an advanced multimodal imaging system for cutaneous tissue oxygenation and perfusion parameters but also elucidated its potential for wound healing assessment in clinical practice. © 2014 Copyright SPIE.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Quantitative description of such data requires estimating the number of components in the sample, their characteristic fluorescent decays, and their relative contributions or abundances. Unfortunately, this inverse problem usually requires prior knowledge about the data, which is seldom available in biomedical applications. This work presents a new methodology to estimate the number of potential endogenous fluorophores present in biological tissue samples from time-domain m-FLIM data. Furthermore, a completely blind linear unmixing algorithm is proposed. The method was validated using both synthetic and experimental m-FLIM data. The experimental m-FLIM data include in-vivo measurements from healthy and cancerous hamster cheek-pouch epithelial tissue, and ex-vivo measurements from human coronary atherosclerotic plaques. The analysis of m-FLIM data from in-vivo hamster oral mucosa identified healthy from precancerous lesions, based on the relative concentration of their characteristic fluorophores. The algorithm also provided a better description of atherosclerotic plaques in term of their endogenous fluorophores. These results demonstrate the potential of this methodology to provide quantitative description of tissue biochemical composition. © 2014 Optical Society of America.","Optical Society of America","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Emerging consensus suggests that perhaps over 50% of the most lethal form of the disease, high grade serous ovarian cancer, originates in the Fallopian tube. Cancer changes molecular concentrations of various endogenous fluorophores. Using specific excitation wavelengths and emissions bands on a Multispectral Fluorescence Imaging (MFI) system, spatial and spectral data over a wide field of view can be collected from endogenous fluorophores. Wavelength specific reflectance images provide additional information to normalize for tissue geometry and blood absorption. Ratiometric combination of the images may create high contrast between neighboring normal and abnormal tissue. Twenty-six women undergoing oophorectomy or debulking surgery consented the use of surgical discard tissue samples for MFI imaging. Forty-nine pieces of ovarian tissue and thirty-two pieces of Fallopian tube tissue were collected and imaged with excitation wavelengths between 280 nm and 550 nm. After imaging, each tissue sample was fixed, sectioned and HE stained for pathological evaluation. Comparison of mean intensity values between normal, benign, and cancerous tissue demonstrate a general trend of increased fluorescence of benign tissue and decreased fluorescence of cancerous tissue when compared to normal tissue. The predictive capabilities of the mean intensity measurements are tested using multinomial logistic regression and quadratic discriminant analysis. Adaption of the system for in vivo Fallopian tube and ovary endoscopic imaging is possible and is briefly described. © 2015 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

We examine herein multispectral opto-acoustic tomography (MSOT), a novel technology for high-resolution molecular imaging deep inside tissues. MSOT illuminates tissue with light pulses at multiple wavelengths and detects the acoustic waves generated by the thermoelastic expansion of the environment surrounding absorbing molecules. Using spectral unmixing analysis of the data collected, MSOT can then differentiate the spectral signatures of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin and of photo-absorbing agents and quantify their concentration. By being able to detect absorbing molecules up to centimeters deep in the tissue it represents an ideal modality for small animal brain imaging, simultaneously providing anatomical, hemodynamic, functional, and molecular information. In this work we examine the capacity of MSOT in cross-sectional brain imaging of mice. We find unprecedented optical imaging performance in cross-sectional visualization of anatomical and physiological parameters of the mouse brain. For example, the potential of MSOT to characterize ischemic brain areas was demonstrated through the use of a carbon dioxide challenge. In addition, indocyanine green (ICG) was injected intravenously, and the kinetics of uptake and clearance in the vasculature of the brain was visualized in real-time. We further found that multiparameter, multispectral imaging of the growth of U87 tumor cells injected into the brain could be visualized through the intact mouse head, for example through visualization of deoxygenated hemoglobin in the growing tumor. We also demonstrate how MSOT offers several compelling features for brain research and allows time-dependent detection and quantification of brain parameters that are not available using other imaging methods without invasive procedures. © 2012.","","Article","","Scopus"

In this study, we derived several intensity normalization approaches with inspiration from expert manual analysis protocols, for classification of carotid vessel wall plaque from in vivo multispectral MRI. We investigated intensity normalization based on a circular region centered at lumen (nCircle); based on sternocleidomastoid muscle (nSCM); based on intensity scaling (nScaling); based on manually classified fibrous tissue (nManuFibrous) and based on automatic classified fibrous tissue (nAutoFibrous). The proposed normalization methods were evaluated using three metrics: (1) Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) between manual and automatic segmentation obtained by classifiers using different normalizations; (2) correlation between proposed normalizations and normalization used by expert; (3) Mahalanobis Distance between pairs of components. In the performed classification experiments, features of normalized image, smoothed, gradient magnitude and Laplacian images at multi-scales, distance to lumen, distance to outer wall, wall thickness were calculated for each vessel wall (VW) pixel. A supervised pattern recognition system, based on a linear discriminate classifier, was trained using the manual segmentation result to classify each VW pixel to be one of the four classes: fibrous tissue, lipid, calcification, and loose matrix according to the highest posterior probability. We evaluated our method on image data of 23 patients. Compared to the result of conventional square region based intensity normalizatio n, nScaling resulted in significant increase in DSC for lipid (p = 0.006) and nAutoFibrous resulted in significant increase in DSC for calcification (p = 0.004). In conclusion, it was demonstrated that the conventional region based normalization approach is not optimal and nAutoFibrous and nScaling are promising approaches deserving further studies. © 2015 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Current methods have not proven optimal for the quantitative analysis of DNA methylation and corresponding in situ protein expression within cells in small specimens like skin biopsies. We have overcome this limitation by combining and modifying several techniques: target cell enrichment, DNA micro-isolation, one-step denaturation/bisulphite conversion/in-column desulphonation, specially designed PCR amplification, pyrosequencing and multispectral image analysis. Using this approach optimized for small samples, we can quantify minor alterations in gene methylation and protein expression using minimal amounts of tissue. Comparative studies of fresh and processed cells showed that our method is valid for DNA in both fresh and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens. We can measure the effects of DNA methylation inhibitors, administered in vitro or in vivo, on the promoter methylation and protein expression of selected genes in specific cells. This novel approach should prove useful for a wide variety of investigative and clinical applications in dermatology and other specialties where the collection of small, routinely processed biopsy specimens is common.

Since an incompletely resected tumor easily leads to recidivism, the gold standard is to remove malignant tissue with a sufficient safety margin and send it to pathology for examination with patho-histological techniques (rapid section diagnosis). This approach, however, exhibits several disadvantages: The removal of additional tissue (safety margin) means additional stress to the patient; the correct interpretation of proper tumor excision relies on the pathologist""™s experience and the waiting time between resection and pathological result can be more than 45 minutes. This last aspect implies unnecessary occupation of cost-intensive operating room staff as well as longer anesthesia for the patient. Various research groups state that hyperspectral imaging in the mid-infrared, especially in the so called «fingerprint region», allows spatially resolved discrimination between normal and malignant tissue. All these experiments, though, took place in a laboratory environment and were conducted on dried, ex vivo tissue and on a microscopic scale. It is therefore our aim to develop a system incorporating the following properties: Intraoperatively and in vivo applicable, measurement time shorter than one minute, based on mid infrared spectroscopy, providing both spectral and spatial information and no use of external fluorescence markers. Theoretical assessment of different concepts and experimental studies show that a setup based on a tunable Quantum Cascade Laser and Attenuated Total Reflection seems feasible for in vivo tissue discrimination via imaging. This is confirmed by experiments with a first demonstrator. © 2015 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Materials and Methods: Institutional Review Board′s approval was obtained for this study. A total of 30 patients undergoing prostatectomy for biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer were included in this study with informed consent. Multispectral PA imaging was performed on surgically excised prostate tissue and chromophore images that represent optical absorption of deoxyhemoglobin (dHb), oxyhemoglobin (HbO 2 ), lipid, and water were reconstructed. After the imaging procedure is completed, malignant prostate, BPH and normal prostate regions were marked by the genitourinary pathologist on histopathology slides and digital images of marked histopathology slides were obtained. The histopathology images were co-registered with chromophore images. Region of interest (ROI) corresponding to malignant prostate, BPH and normal prostate were defined on the chromophore images. Pixel values within each ROI were then averaged to determine mean intensities of dHb, HbO 2 , lipid, and water. Results: Our preliminary results show that there is statistically significant difference in mean intensity of dHb (P < 0.0001) and lipid (P = 0.0251) between malignant prostate and normal prostate tissue. There was difference in mean intensity of dHb (P < 0.0001) between malignant prostate and BPH. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of our imaging system were found to be 81.3%, 96.2%, 92.9% and 89.3% respectively. Conclusion: Our preliminary results of ex-vivo human prostate study suggest that multispectral PA imaging can differentiate between malignant prostate, BPH and normal prostate tissue.","Medknow Publications","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Materials and Methods: Procedures involving animals were approved by the government of Upper Bavaria. Imaging of subcutaneous tumors in mice was performed by using an experimental MSOT setup that produces transverse images at 10 frames per second with an in-plane resolution of approximately 150 mm. To study dynamic contrast enhancement, three mice with 4T1 tumors were imaged before and immediately, 20 minutes, 4 hours, and 24 hours after systemic injection of indocyanine green (ICG). Epifluorescence imaging was used for comparison. MSOT of a targeted fluorescent agent (6 hours after injection) and hemoglobin oxygenation was performed simultaneously (4T1 tumors: n = 3). Epifluorescence of cryosections served as validation. The accumulation owing to enhanced permeability and retention in tumors (4T1 tumors: n = 4, HT29 tumors: n = 3, A2780 tumors: n = 2) was evaluated with use of long-circulating gold nanorods (before and immediately, 1 hour, 5 hours, and 24 hours after injection). Dark-field microscopy was used for validation. Results: Dynamic contrast enhancement with ICG was possible. MSOT, in contrast to epifluorescence imaging, showed a heterogeneous intratumoral agent distribution. Simultaneous imaging of a targeted fluorescent agent and oxyand deoxyhemoglobin gave functional information about tumor vasculature in addition to the related agent uptake. The accumulation of gold nanorods in tumors seen at MSOT over time also showed heterogeneous uptake. Conclusion: MSOT enables live high-spatial- resolution observations through tumors, producing images of distributions of fluorochromes and nanoparticles as well as tumor vasculature. © RSNA, 2012.","","Article","","Scopus"

Additionally, increased diagnostic sensitivity is expected with the application of multiple molecular probes. We developed a real-time multispectral fluorescence-reflectance scanning fiber endoscope (SFE) for wide-field molecular imaging of fluorescent dye-labeled molecular probes at nanomolar detection levels. Concurrent multichannel imaging with the wide-field SFE also allows for real-time mitigation of the background autofluorescence (AF) signal, especially when fluorescein, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved dye, is used as the target fluorophore. Quantitative tissue AF was measured for the ex vivo porcine esophagus and murine brain tissues across the visible and nearinfrared spectra. AF signals were then transferred to the unit of targeted fluorophore concentration to evaluate the SFE detection sensitivity for sodium fluorescein and cyanine. Next, we demonstrated a real-time AF mitigation algorithm on a tissue phantom, which featured molecular probe targeted cells of high-grade dysplasia on a substrate containing AF species. The target-to-background ratio was enhanced by more than one order of magnitude when applying the real-time AF mitigation algorithm. Furthermore, a quantitative estimate of the fluorescein photodegradation (photobleaching) rate was evaluated and shown to be insignificant under the illumination conditions of SFE. In summary, the multichannel laser-based flexible SFE has demonstrated the capability to provide sufficient detection sensitivity, image contrast, and quantitative target intensity information for detecting small precancerous lesions in vivo. © 2014 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.","","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Furthermore, imaging speeds in previous multispectral stimulated Raman scattering imaging techniques were limited. Here, we demonstrate label-free imaging of tissues by 30 frames/s stimulated Raman scattering microscopy with frame-by-frame wavelength tunability. To produce multicolour images showing different constituents, spectral images were processed by modified independent component analysis, which can extract small differences in spectral features.

The development of denoising methods which prevent the need for signal averaging in time presents an important goal for advancing the dynamic capabilities of the technology.; Methods: In this paper, a denoising method is developed for multispectral optoacoustic imaging which exploits the implicit sparsity of multispectral optoacoustic signals both in space and in spectrum. Noise suppression is achieved by applying thresholding on a combined wavelet-KarhunenLoeve representation in which multispectral optoacoustic signals appear particularly sparse. The method is based on inherent characteristics of multispectral optoacoustic signals of tissues, offering promise for general application in different incarnations of multispectral optoacoustic systems.; Results: The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on mouse images acquired in vivo for two common additive noise sources: time-varying parasitic signals and white noise. In both cases, the proposed method shows considerable improvement in image quality in omparison to previously published denoising strategies that do not consider multispectral information.; Conclusions: The suggested denoising methodology can achieve noise suppression with minimal signal loss and considerably outperforms previously proposed denoising strategies, holding promise for advancing the dynamic capabilities of multispectral optoacoustic imaging while retaining image quality. © 2014 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","AAPM - American Association of Physicists in Medicine","Article","","Scopus"

Within this study a potential toxicity risk of all nanoscaled drug delivery systems was found. An accumulation of several structurally different nanocarriers but not of soluble polymers was detected in rodent ovaries after intravenous (i.v.) administration. Studies in different mouse species and Wistar rats were conducted and a high local accumulation of nanoparticles, nanocapsules and nanoemulsions in specific locations of the ovaries was found in all animals. We characterised the enrichment by in vivo and ex vivo multispectral fluorescence imaging and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The findings of this study emphasise the role of early and comprehensive in vivo studies in pharmaceutical research. Nanocarrier accumulation in the ovaries may also comprise an important toxicity issue in humans but the results might as well open a new field of targeted ovarian therapies. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","","Article","","Scopus"

To investigate the potential of the NP-based strategies for colon-specific delivery, two formulations, free Eudragit® NPs and enteric-coated NP-loaded chitosan-hypromellose microcapsules (MCs) were fluorescently-labelled and their tissue distribution in mice after oral administration was monitored by multispectral small animal imaging. The free NPs showed a shorter transit time throughout the mouse digestive tract than the MCs, with extensive excretion of NPs in faeces at 5 h. Conversely, the MCs showed complete NP release in the lower region of the mouse small intestine at 8 h post-administration. Overall, the encapsulation of NPs in MCs resulted in a higher colonic NP intensity from 8 h to 24 h post-administration compared to the free NPs, due to a NP 'guarding' effect of MCs during their transit along mouse gastrointestinal tract which decreased NP excretion in faeces. These imaging data revealed that this widely-utilised colon-targeting MC formulation lacked site-precision for releasing its NP load in the colon, but the increased residence time of the NPs in the lower gastrointestinal tract suggests that it is still useful for localised release of chemotherapeutics, compared to NP administration alone. In addition, both formulations resided in the stomach of mice at considerable concentrations over 24 h. Thus, adhesion of NP- or MC-based oral delivery systems to gastric mucosa may be problematic for colon-specific delivery of the cargo to the colon and should be carefully investigated for a full evaluation of particulate delivery systems. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To remove fluorophore emission cross-talk in wide-field multispectral fluorescence molecular imaging, we evaluate three different solutions: (1) image stitching, (2) concurrent imaging with cross-talk ratio subtraction algorithm, and (3) frame-sequential imaging. A phantom with fluorophore emission cross-talk is fabricated, and a 1.2-mm ultrathin scanning fiber endoscope (SFE) is used to test and compare these approaches. Results show that fluorophore emission cross-talk could be successfully avoided or significantly reduced. Near term, the concurrent imaging method of wide-field multispectral fluorescence SFE is viable for early stage cancer detection and localization in vivo.

However, clinical acceptance of hyper spectral imaging in ischemic wound assessment is hampered by its poor reproducibility, low accuracy, and misinterpreted biology. These limitations are partially caused by the lack of a traceable calibration standard. We proposed a digital tissue phantom (DTP) platform for quantitative calibration and performance evaluation of spectral wound imaging devices. The technical feasibility of such a DTP platform was demonstrated by both in vitro and in vivo experiments. The in vitro DTPs were developed based on a liquid blood phantom model. The in vivo DTPs were developed based on a porcine ischemic skin flap model. The DTPs were projected by a Hyper spectral Image Projector (HIP) with high fidelity. A wide-gap 2nd derivative oxygenation algorithm was developed to reconstruct tissue functional parameters from hyper spectral measurements. In this study, we have demonstrated not only the technical feasibility of using DTPs for quantitative calibration, evaluation, and optimization of spectral imaging devices but also its potential for ischemic wound assessment in clinical practice. © 2012 Optical Society of America.","OSA - The Optical Society","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

It is therefore useful to develop instrumentation that can be used to characterize tissue autofluorescence in situ. While spectroscopic imaging modalities such as fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) and multispectral imaging are clearly desirable to correlate biochemical information with morphology and facilitate direct comparisons with histopathology, the amount of useful spectroscopic information available can be limited by the finite numbers of detected photons associated with clinically practical data acquisition times and by difficulties associated with engineering appropriately compact and sterilizable clinical endoscopes. Fiber-optic-based probes delivering single-point measurements of autofluorescence can be made much more compact and at lower cost compared to imaging instruments and are simpler to engineer. They also provide more opportunities for more sophisticated multidimensional analysis of autofluorescence signals because all the detected photons contribute to a single (spatial) detection channel and measurement times of a few seconds, which are practical for in vivo applications and can provide sufficient photons to permit, for example, spectrally resolved analysis of multiexponential fluorescence decay profiles. Furthermore, the compact nature of nonimaging fiber-optic probes means that they can be readily applied via the biopsy port of a standard clinical endoscope with minimal perturbation to existing clinical procedures. © 2015 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","CRC Press","Book chapter","","Scopus"

In our study, we will research the image features of FIuo-ACP probe targeted bladder cancer for fluorescence molecular imaging diagnosis for bladder cancer in vivo and ex vivo. Methods: After the FIuo-ACP probe was synthetized, the binding sites, factors affecting binding rates, the specificity and the targeting of Fluo-ACP labeled with bladder cancer cells were studied respectively by laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM), immunofluorescence and multispectral fluorescence ex vivo optical molecular imaging system. Results: The binding sites were located in nucleus and the binding rates were correlated linearly with the dose of probe and the grade of pathology. Moreover, the probe has a binding specificity with bladder cancer in vivo and ex vivo. Tumor cells being labeled by the Fluo-ACP, bright green spots were observed under LSCM. The tissue samples and tumor cells can be labeled and identified by fluorescence microscope. Optical molecular imaging of xenograft tumor tissues was exhibited as fluorescent spots under EMCCD.

There is evident coupling between increases in neuronal activity and increases in local blood flow; however, many aspects of this neurovascular coupling remain unexplained by current models. Based on the rapid dilation of distant pial arteries during cortical functional hyperemia, we hypothesized that endothelial signaling may play a key role in the long-range propagation of vasodilation during functional hyperemia in the brain. Although well characterized in the peripheral vasculature, endothelial involvement in functional neurovascular coupling has not been demonstrated. Methods and Results-We combined in vivo exposed-cortex multispectral optical intrinsic signal imaging (MS-OISI) with a novel in vivo implementation of the light-dye technique to record the cortical hemodynamic response to somatosensory stimulus in rats before and after spatially selective endothelial disruption. We demonstrate that discrete interruption of endothelial signaling halts propagation of stimulus-evoked vasodilation in pial arteries, and that wide-field endothelial disruption in pial arteries significantly attenuates the hemodynamic response to stimulus, particularly the early, rapid increase and peak in hyperemia. Conclusions-Involvement of endothelial pathways in functional neurovascular coupling provides new explanations for the spatial and temporal features of the hemodynamic response to stimulus and could explain previous results that were interpreted as evidence for astrocyte-mediated control of functional hyperemia.

To acquire information on this cell-matrix interaction, we developed a technique for colocalized, correlative multispectral tissue analysis by implementing high-sensitivity, wide-field fluorescence imaging on a confocal Raman microscope. As a proof of principle, we study early stages of bone formation in the zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae because the zebrafish has emerged as a model organism to study vertebrate development.

Results obtained from early stages of mineral deposition in the zebrafish fin bone unequivocally show the presence of hydrogen phosphate containing mineral phases in addition to the carbonated apatite mineral.

While ultrasound is widely used in clinical practice for real-time guidance, the image contrast that it provides can be insufficient for visualizing tissue structures such as blood vessels, nerves, and tumors. This study was centered on the development of a photoacoustic imaging system for interventional procedures that delivered excitation light in the ranges of 750 to 900 nm and 1150 to 1300 nm, with an optical fiber positioned in a needle cannula. Coregistered B-mode ultrasound images were obtained. The system, which was based on a commercial ultrasound imaging scanner, has an axial resolution in the vicinity of 100 μm and a submillimeter, depth-dependent lateral resolution. Using a tissue phantom and 800 nm excitation light, a simulated blood vessel could be visualized at a maximum distance of 15 mm from the needle tip. Spectroscopic contrast for hemoglobin and lipids was observed with ex vivo tissue samples, with photoacoustic signal maxima consistent with the respective optical absorption spectra.

Background: Near-infrared approaches to imaging cardiovascular disease enable visualization of disease-associated biological processes in vivo. However, even at the scale of small animals, the strong scattering of light prevents high resolution imaging after the first 1-2. mm of tissue, leading to degraded signal localization. Methods: Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) was used to non-invasively image myocardial infarction (MI) in a murine model of coronary artery ligation at resolutions not possible with current deep-tissue optical imaging methods. Post-MI imaging was based on resolving the spectral absorption signature of a dendritic polyglycerol sulfate-based (dPGS) near-infrared imaging agent targeted to P- and L-selectin. Results: In vivo imaging succeeded in detection of the agent in the injured myocardium after intravenous injection. The high anatomic resolution (<200. μm) achieved by the described method allowed signals originating in the infarcted heart to be distinguished from uptake in adjacent regions. Histological analysis found dPGS signal in infarcted areas, originating from leukocytes and endothelial cells. Conclusions: MSOT imaging of myocardial infarction provides non-invasive visualization of optical contrast with a high spatial resolution that is not degraded by the scattering of light. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.","","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

High precision imaging methods are available, though expensive and non-portable, however, the methods devised for the mass population, often suffer from the lack of precision. Therefore, the development of a safe, mobile, non-invasive, optical method that would be easy to perform, precise and low-cost, but also would offer an accurate assessment of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) both in lean and in obese persons is required. Thereof, the diffuse optical spectroscopy is advantageous over the aforementioned techniques. A prototype device using an optical method for measurement of the SAT thickness in vivo has been developed. The probe contained multiple LEDs (660nm) distributed at various distances from the photo-detector which allow different light penetration depths into the subcutaneous tissue. The differences of the reflected light intensities were used to create a non-linear model, and the computed values were compared with the corresponding thicknesses of SAT, assessed by B-mode ultrasonography. The results show that with the optical system used in this study, accurate results of different SAT thicknesses can be obtained, and imply a further potential for development of multispectral optical system to observe changes of SAT thickness as well as to determine the percentage of total body fat. © 2012 SPIE.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Moreover, these measurements were carried out with two different substrates (one bright and the other dark) successively placed beneath each sample, allowing a reasonably accurate evaluation of the contributions to the overall backscattered light by the various layers. For the shorter investigated wavelengths (500 to 550 nm) the major contribution comes from mucosa and submucosa, while for the longer wavelengths (650 to 700 nm) muscular tissue and fat also contribute significantly. The depolarization has also been studied and is found to be stronger in the red part of the spectrum, mainly due to the highly depolarizing power of the muscular and fat layers. © 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","","Article","","Scopus"

However, a key obstacle to cell therapy's success is the loss of engrafted cells due to apoptosis or necrosis in the ischemic myocardium. While many strategies have been developed to improve engrafted cell survival, tools to evaluate cell efficacy within the body are limited. Traditional genetic labeling tools, such as GFP-like fluorescent proteins (eGFP, DsRed, mCherry), have limited penetration depths in vivo due to tissue scattering and absorption. To circumvent these limitations, a near-infrared fluorescent mutant of the DrBphP bacteriophytochrome from Deinococcus radiodurans, IFP1.4, was developed for in vivo imaging, but it has yet to be used for in vivo stem/progenitor cell tracking. In this study, we incorporated IFP1.4 into mouse cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) by a lentiviral vector. Live IFP1.4-labeled CPCs were imaged by their near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) using an Odyssey scanner following overnight incubation with biliverdin. A significant linear correlation was observed between the amount of cells and NIRF signal intensity in in vitro studies. Lentiviral mediated IFP1.4 gene labeling is stable, and does not impact the apoptosis and cardiac differentiation of CPC. To assess efficacy of our model for engrafted cells in vivo, IFP1.4-labeled CPCs were intramyocardially injected into infarcted hearts. NIRF signals were collected at 1-day, 7-days, and 14-days postinjection using the Kodak in vivo multispectral imaging system. Strong NIRF signals from engrafted cells were imaged 1 day after injection. At 1 week after injection, 70% of the NIRF signal was lost when compared to the intensity of the day 1 signal. The data collected 2 weeks following transplantation showed an 88% decrease when compared to day 1. Our studies have shown that IFP1.4 gene labeling can be used to track the viability of transplanted cells in vivo.

We investigated here the performance of optoacoustic mesoscopy implemented at 24MHz center frequency and its ability to resolve optical absorption contrast in the mouse kidney ex vivo. The developed system achieved better than 30μm in-plane resolution and 110μm elevation resolution over a cylindrical volume of 9-mm diameter and 9-mm height.

An objective measurement device can help as a valuable tool for skin analysis. We propose an explorative new multispectral camera specifically developed for dermatology/cosmetology applications. The multispectral imaging system provides images of skin reflectance at different wavebands covering visible and near-infrared domain. It is coupled with a neural network-based algorithm for the reconstruction of reflectance cube of cutaneous data. This cube contains only skin optical reflectance spectrum in each pixel of the bidimensional spatial information. The reflectance cube is analyzed by an algorithm based on a Kubelka-Munk model combined with evolutionary algorithm. The technique allows quantitative measure of cutaneous tissue and retrieves five skin parameter maps: melanin concentration, epidermis/dermis thickness, haemoglobin concentration, and the oxygenated hemoglobin. The results retrieved on healthy participants by the algorithm are in good accordance with the data from the literature. The usefulness of the developed technique was proved during two experiments: a clinical study based on vitiligo and melasma skin lesions and a skin oxygenation experiment (induced ischemia) with healthy participant where normal tissues are recorded at normal state and when temporary ischemia is induced. © 2013 Romuald Jolivot et al.","","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Our customized multispectral hardware, which featured a scanning transmission microscope and imaging spectrographs equipped with silicon and InGaAs charge-coupled diode array detectors, allowed for direct comparison of the Michelson contrast obtained from a phantom composed of a honeycomb grid, Intralipid, and India ink. The measured contrast depended on the size of the grid, luminance, and the wavelength of measurements. We demonstrated that at low thickness of the phantom, a reasonable contrast of the objects can be achieved at any wavelength between 700 and 1400 nm and between 1500 and 1600 nm. At larger thicknesses, such contrast can be achieved mostly between 1200 and 1350 nm.

The murine dorsal skinfold window chamber model has been used for the study of both tumor microvasculature and other vascular diseases, including the study of anti-angiogenic agents in cancer therapy. Hyperspectral imaging of oxygen status of the microvasculature has not been widely used to evaluate response to inhibition of angiogenesis in early tumor cell induced vascular development. This study demonstrates the use of two different classes of anti-angiogenic agents, one targeting the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) pathway involved with vessel sprouting and the other targeting the Angiopoietin/Tie2 pathway involved in vascular destabilization. Studies evaluated the tumor microvascular response to anti-angiogenic inhibitors in the highly angiogenic renal cell carcinoma induced angiogenesis model. Methods. Human renal cell carcinoma, Caki-2 cells, were implanted in the murine skinfold window chamber. Mice were treated with either VEGF pathway targeted small molecule inhibitor Sunitinib (100 mg/kg) or with an anti-Ang-2 monoclonal antibody (10 mg/kg) beginning the day of window chamber surgery and tumor cell implantation. Hyperspectral imaging of hemoglobin saturation was used to evaluate both the development and oxygenation of the tumor microvasculature. Tumor volume over time was also assessed over an 11-day period post surgery. Results: The window chamber model was useful to demonstrate the inhibition of angiogenesis using the VEGF pathway targeted agent Sunitinib. Results show impairment of tumor microvascular development, reduced oxygenation of tumor-associated vasculature and impairment of tumor volume growth compared to control. On the other hand, this model failed to demonstrate the anti-angiogenic effect of the Ang-2 targeted agent. Follow up experiments suggest that the initial surgery of the window chamber model may interfere with such an agent thus skewing the actual effects on angiogenesis. Conclusions: Results show that this model has great potential to evaluate anti-VEGF, or comparable, targeted agents; however the mere protocol of the window chamber model interferes with proper evaluation of Ang-2 targeted agents. The limitations of this in vivo model in evaluating the response of tumor vasculature to anti-angiogenic agents are discussed. © 2014 Biel et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

With the increasing percentage of the population becoming overweight, it is important to diagnose when the excess adipose tissue becomes malign. The development of a safe, mobile, non-invasive method that would be easy to perform, and low-cost, but also would offer an accurate assessment of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) both in lean and in obese persons is required. A prototype device using an optical method for measurement of the SAT in vivo has been developed, it contains multiple LEDs with four wavelengths (660nm, 780nm, 870nm, 940nm) distributed at various distances from the photodetector which allow different light penetration depths into the subcutaneous tissue. Five young healthy female students participated in the study; the measurements were performed on three body sites: calf, upper and lower abdomen. The backscattered light acquired with the prototype was compared to SAT measured with high resolution ultrasound imaging. The coefficient of variation indicated high reliability of the measurements. Statistically significant (from r=0.81 to r=0.95; p<0.05) correlation between intensity of backscattered light and SAT thicknesses for all four wavelength was observed, especially at source-detector distance 25mm. The novel device prototype has a potential to be a good alternative for conventional SAT measurement and assessment of cardiometabolic risk. Amultispectral approach can potentially increase precision and spatial resolution of SAT determination. © 2013 SPIE.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

The analysis of skin images for the extraction of melanin and hemoglobin is an example of the use of BSS. This paper presents a proof of concept of the use of source separation of ex-vivo aorta tissue multispectral Images. The images are acquired with an interference filter-based imaging system. The images are processed by means of two algorithms: Independent Components analysis and Non-negative Matrix Factorization. In both cases, it is possible to obtain maps that quantify the concentration of the main chromophores present in aortic tissue. Also, the algorithms allow for spectral absorbance of the main tissue components. Those spectral signatures were compared against the theoretical ones by using correlation coefficients. Those coefficients report values close to 0.9, which is a good estimator of the method’s performance. Also, correlation coefficients lead to the identification of the concentration maps according to the evaluated chromophore.

In particular, light scattering and attenuation in tissue at depths beyond subcutaneous implantation hinder adequate visualization. We evaluate the use of multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) to detect upregulated epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor in orthotopic pancreatic xenografts using a near-infrared EGF-conjugated CF-750 fluorescent probe. MSOT is based on the photoacoustic effect and thus not limited by photon scattering, resulting in high-resolution tomographic images. Pancreatic tumor-bearing mice with luciferase-transduced S2VP10L tumors were intravenously injected with EGF-750 probe before MSOT imaging. We characterized probe specificity and bioactivity via immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometric analysis. In vitro data along with optical bioluminescence/fluorescence imaging were used to validate acquired MSOT in vivo images of probe biodistribution. Indocyanine green dye was used as a nonspecific control to define specificity of EGF-probe accumulation. Maximum accumulation occurred at 6 hours postinjection, demonstrating specific intratumoral probe uptake and minimal liver and kidney off-target accumulation. Optical bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging confirmed tumor-specific probe accumulation consistent with MSOT images. These studies demonstrate the utility of MSOT to obtain volumetric images of ligand probe biodistribution in vivo to detect orthotopic pancreatic tumor lesions through active targeting of the EGF receptor. © 2014 American Association for Cancer Research.","American Association for Cancer Research Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Here we investigate the applicability of real-time functional optoacoustic imaging for monitoring of stroke progression in the whole brain of living animals.

Results: Post ischemia an asymmetry of deoxygenated hemoglobin in the brain was observed as a region of hypoxia in the hemisphere affected by the ischemic event. Furthermore, we were able to visualize the penumbra in-vivo as a localized hemodynamically-compromised area adjacent to the region of stroke-induced perfusion deficit.

Although trastuzumab reduces production of the angiogenic factor VEGF in HER2 + tumors, the acute and sustained effects of trastuzumab on the tumor vasculature are not understood fully, particularly in trastuzumab-resistant tumors. We used mouse models of trastuzumab sensitive and trastuzumab-resistant HER2 + breast cancers to measure dynamic changes in tumor microvessel density and hemoglobin oxygenation (sO2) in vivo using quantitative hyperspectral imaging at 2, 5, 9, and 14 days after antibody treatment. Further analysis quantified the distribution of microvessels into low and high oxygenation groups, and monitored changes in these distributions with trastuzumab treatment. Gold standard immunohistochemistry was performed to validate complementary markers of tumor cell and vascular response to treatment. Trastuzumab treatment in both responsive and resistant tumors resulted in decreased sO2 5 days after initial treatment when compared to IgG-treated controls (p<0.05). Importantly, responsive tumors showed significantly higher vessel density and significantly lower sO2 than all other groups at 5 days post-treatment (p<0.05). Distribution analysis of vessel sO2 showed a significant (p<0.05) shift of highly oxygenated vessels towards lower oxygenation over the time-course in both trastuzumab-treated responsive and resistant tumors. This study suggests that longitudinal hyperspectral imaging of microvessel sO2 and density could distinguish trastuzumab responsive from trastuzumab-resistant tumors, a finding that could be exploited in the post-neoadjuvant setting to guide post-surgical treatment decisions. © 2014 Optical Society of America.","OSA - The Optical Society","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The method proposed exploits a multispectral imaging device to acquire a set of images in the visible and NIR range. This kind of information can be very helpful to improve early diagnosis of melanoma, a very aggressive cutaneous neoplasm, incidence and mortality of which continues to rise worldwide. Currently, noninvasive methods (i.e. dermoscopy) have improved melanoma detection, but the definitive diagnosis is still achieved only by invasive method (istopathological observation of the excised lesion). The multispectral system we developed is capable of imaging layers of structures placed at increasing depth, thanks to the fact that light propagates into the skin and reaches different depths depending on its wavelength. This allows to image many features which are less or not visible in the clinical and dermoscopic examination. A new semeiotics is proposed to describe the content of multispectral images. Dermoscopic criteria can be easily applied to describe each image in the set, however inter-images correlations need new suitable descriptors. The first group of new parameters describes how the dermoscopic features, vary across the set of images. More aspects are then introduced. E.g. the longest wavelength where structures can be detected gives an estimate of the maximum depth reached by the pigmented lesion. While the presence of a bright-to-dark transition between the wavebands in the violet to blue range, reveals the presence of blue-whitish veil, which is a further malignancy marker. © 2013 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

To address this limitation, we developed dynamic imaging methods to measure blood flow and hemoglobin oxygen saturation in implanted prevascularized tissues noninvasively and longitudinally. Using laser speckle imaging, multispectral imaging, and intravital microscopy, we demonstrate that fibrin-based tissue implants anastomose with the host (severe combined immunodeficient mice) in as short as 20 h. Anastomosis results in initial perfusion with highly oxygenated blood, and an increase in average hemoglobin oxygenation of 53%. However, shear rates in the preformed vessels were low (20.8 ± 12.8 s -1), and flow did not persist in the vast majority of preformed vessels due to thrombus formation. These findings suggest that designing an appropriate vascular network structure in prevascularized tissues to maintain shear rates above the threshold for thrombosis may be necessary to maintain flow following implantation. We conclude that wide-field and microscopic functional imaging together enables longitudinal assessment of hemodynamics in prevascularized tissues, and rapid evaluation and refinement of vascularization strategies used in tissue engineering. © OSA 2012.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

The six optical technologies investigated include fluorescence spectroscopy, reflectance spectroscopy, and their combination using point probe or multispectral imaging approaches. Searching in the well-known databases, the most recent published works were sought out. Various aspects of the studies were evaluated including the details of the technology used, the pathologic threshold for tissue classification and the gold standard, the study population and prevalence of disease in this population, the method of measurement, the number of clinicians involved in the study, the classification and validation algorithms, and the performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity and, when available, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Forty-four studies conducted from 1994 to 2012 were evaluated. The data are gathered in two comprehensive tables, and five illustrations are provided to simplify a comparison between studies from different points of view. There is a broad band of studies from small pilot studies through phase III clinical trials. Among the reviewed articles, only three factors were found to influence the performance of the optical spectroscopy studies. Multispectral approaches show higher specificity than the point probe approaches (p = 0.001). The use of acetic acid before measurement and prevalence of disease among the studied population, also, have an impact on the sensitivity and specificity of the studies (p < 0.05), respectively. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","Springer-Verlag London Ltd","Review","","Scopus"

Beef tissues treated by both water bath and high-intensity focused ultrasound were imaged and evaluated by photoacoustic imaging method, where light in multiple optical wavelengths between 700nm and 900nm is applied. Tissue denaturation after being treated by water bath and high-intensity focused ultrasound has been observed in multispectral photoacoustic images. The denaturation is more striking in relatively shorter optical wavelength photoacoustic images than in relatively longer optical wavelength photoacoustic images. This study suggests that multispectral photoacoustic imaging method is promising in the evaluation of tissue denaturation induced by high- intensity focused ultrasound treatment. © 2013 Copyright SPIE.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

The aim of exploiting the DOP as the contrast element is to demonstrate that the elliptical DOP provides more information characterizing complex medium than the more traditional linear and circular ones. The system considers an incoherent input white light beam and opportunely calibrated nematic crystals (LCVR), so no mechanical tools are necessary. The particular features of the system indicate it to be the perfect candidate for a new imaging system considering in-vivo (as well as ex-vivo) non invasive superficial diagnostic for medical application as dermatologic diagnostics, since no type of sample preparation is necessary, i.e. tissue biopsy, radiation or contrast agent injection. Thus the biomedical application of this method suggests a simple, direct, fast and also easily exploitable future employment, as a desirable mean for clinical investigation but also for digital recognition in biometrics. Further new elements to improve the model of light scattering and matter-light interaction will be acquired, in particular considering a very complete characterization of the system response using latex microspheres suspension to simulate turbid media with different concentration. © 2012 SPIE.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Here, the mechanism of neutrophil abscess formation was investigated using a mouse model of Staphylococcus aureus cutaneous infection. Gene expression analysis and in vivo multispectral noninvasive imaging during the S. aureus infection revealed a strong functional and temporal association between neutrophil recruitment and IL-1β/IL-1R activation. Unexpectedly, neutrophils but not monocytes/macrophages or other MHCII-expressing antigen presenting cells were the predominant source of IL-1β at the site of infection. Furthermore, neutrophil-derived IL-1β was essential for host defense since adoptive transfer of IL-1β-expressing neutrophils was sufficient to restore the impaired neutrophil abscess formation in S. aureus-infected IL-1β-deficient mice. S. aureus-induced IL-1β production by neutrophils required TLR2, NOD2, FPR1 and the ASC/NLRP3 inflammasome in an α-toxin-dependent mechanism. Taken together, IL-1β and neutrophil abscess formation during an infection are functionally, temporally and spatially linked as a consequence of direct IL-1β production by neutrophils. © 2012 Cho et al.","","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Recent work has suggested that this approach may be extended to allow surgical attachment of larger tissue segments for applications such as bowel anastomosis. In a large series of porcine surgical procedures bipolar RF energy was used to resect and re-seal the small bowel in vivo with a commercial tissue fusion device (Ligasure; Covidien PLC, USA). The tissue was then imaged with a multispectral imaging laparoscope to obtain a spectral datacube comprising both fused and healthy tissue. Maps of blood volume, oxygen saturation and scattering power were derived from the measured reflectance spectra using an optimised light-tissue interaction model. A 60% increase in reflectance of visible light (460-700 nm) was observed after fusion, with the tissue taking on a white appearance. Despite this the distinctive shape of the haemoglobin absorption spectrum was still noticeable in the 460-600 nm wavelength range. Scattering power increased in the fused region in comparison to normal serosa, while blood volume and oxygen saturation decreased. Observed fusion-induced changes in the reflectance spectrum are consistent with the biophysical changes induced through tissue denaturation and increased collagen cross-linking. The multispectral imager allows mapping of the spatial extent of these changes and classification of the zone of damaged tissue. Further analysis of the spectral data in parallel with histopathological examination of excised specimens will allow correlation of the optical property changes with microscopic alterations in tissue structure. © 2015 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

But information abstracted from these images is in most cases restricted to 2-dimensions, without the depth information. In this work, a simple method has been developed to accurately ascertain the tissue imaging depth based on the relative luminescence intensity ratio of multispectral NaYF4:Yb 3+,Er3+ UCNPs. A theoretical mode was set up, where the parameters in the quantitative relation between the relative intensities of the upconversion luminescence spectra and the depth of the UCNPs were determined using tissue mimicking liquid phantoms. The 540 nm and 650 nm luminescence intensity ratios (G/R ratio) of NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ UCNPs were monitored following excitation path (Ex mode) and emission path (Em mode) schemes, respectively. The model was validated by embedding NaYF 4:Yb3+,Er3+ UCNPs in layered pork muscles, which demonstrated a very high accuracy of measurement in the thickness up to centimeter.

As these images can be obtained at multiple wavelengths, quantitatively accurate, spatially resolved, estimates for chromophore concentration, for example, may be obtainable. Such a capability would nd a wide range of clinical and pre-clinical applications. However, despite a growing body of theoretical papers on how this might be achieved, there is a noticeable lack of studies providing validated evidence that it can be achieved experimentally, either in vitro or in vivo. Well-dned, versatile and stable phantom materials are essential to assess the accuracy, robustness and applicability of multispectral Quantitative Photoacoustic Imaging (qPAI) algorithms in experimental scenarios. This study assesses the potential of polyvinyl chloride plastisol (PVCP) as a phantom material for qPAI, building on previous work that focussed on using PVCP for quality control. Parameters that might be controlled or tuned to assess the performance of qPAI algorithms were studied: broadband acoustic properties, multiwavelength optical properties with added absorbers and scatterers, and photoacoustic efficiency. The optical and acoustic properties of PVCP can be tuned to be broadly representative of soft tissue. The Grüneisen parameter is larger than expected in tissue, which is an advantage as it increases the signal-to-noise ratio of the photoacoustic measurements. Interestingly, when the absorption was altered by adding absorbers, the absorption spectra measured using high peak power nanosecond-pulsed sources (typical in photoacoustics) were repeatably diffierent from the ones measured using the low power source in the spectrophotometer, indicative of photochemical reactions taking place.CCC. © 2015 SPIE-OSA.","OSA - The Optical Society","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Traditional imaging mass spectrometry and magnetic resonance imaging are unable to probe the spatial-temporal dynamics of metabolites at the subcellular level due to either lack of spatial resolution or inability to perform live cell imaging. Here we report a complementary metabolic imaging technique that is based on hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (hsSRS). We demonstrated the use of hsSRS imaging in quantifying two major neutral lipids: cholesteryl ester and triacylglycerol in cells and tissues. Our imaging results revealed previously unknown changes of lipid composition associated with obesity and steatohepatitis. We further used stable-isotope labeling to trace the metabolic dynamics of fatty acids in live cells and live Caenorhabditis elegans with hsSRS imaging. We found that unsaturated fatty acid has preferential uptake into lipid storage while saturated fatty acid exhibits toxicity in hepatic cells. Simultaneous metabolic fingerprinting of deuterium-labeled saturated and unsaturated fatty acids in living C. elegans revealed that there is a lack of interaction between the two, unlike previously hypothesized. Our findings provide new approaches for metabolic tracing of neutral lipids and their precursors in living cells and organisms, and could potentially serve as a general approach for metabolic fingerprinting of other metabolites. © 2014 American Chemical Society.","American Chemical Society","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This enables specific land covers to be identified without the need to physically travel to the areas examined. In the medical field, efforts are underway to develop optical technologies that detect altering tissue surfaces without the necessity to perform an excisional biopsy. With the establishment of expedient classification procedures, hyperspectral imaging may provide a non-invasive diagnostic method that allows determination of pathological tissue with high reliability. In this study, we examined the performance of a hyperspectral hybrid method classification for the automatic detection of altered mucosa of the human larynx.Materials and methods: Hyperspectral Imaging was performed in vivo and 30 bands from 390 to 680 nm for 5 cases of laryngeal disorders (2x hemorrhagic polyp, 3x leukoplakia) were obtained. Image stacks were processed with unsupervised clustering (linear spectral unmixing), spectral signatures were extracted from unlabeled cluster maps and subsequently applied as end-members for supervised classification (spectral angle mapper) of further medical cases with identical diagnosis.Results: Linear spectral unmixing clearly highlighted altered mucosa as single spectral clusters in all cases. Matching classes were identified, and extracted spectral signatures could readily be applied for supervised classifications. Automatic target detection performed well, as the considered classes showed notable correspondence with pathological tissue locations.Conclusions: Using hyperspectral classification procedures derived from remote sensing applications for diagnostic purposes can create concrete benefits for the medical field. The approach shows that it would be rewarding to collect spectral signatures from histologically different lesions of laryngeal disorders in order to build up a spectral library and to prospectively allow non-invasive optical biopsies. © 2012 Martin et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Sets of optimal wavelengths have been identified and validated in vivo for multispectral imaging of the OB of rats following odor stimulus. We studied the influence of the wavelengths sets on the magnitude and time courses of the oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin concentration variations as well as on the spatial extent of activated brain areas following stimulation. Beyond the estimation of hemodynamic parameters from multispectral reflectance data, we observed repeatedly and for all wavelengths a decrease of light reflectance. For wavelengths longer than 590 nm, these observations differ from those observed in the somatosensory and barrel cortex and question the basis of the reflectance changes during activation in the OB. To solve this issue, Monte Carlo simulations (MCS) have been carried out to assess the relative contribution of absorption, scattering and anisotropy changes to the intrinsic optical imaging signals in somatosensory cortex (SsC) and OB model. © 2012 SPIE.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

It can be challenging to visualise nerves with conventional ultrasound imaging, however. One of the challenges is that nerves can have very similar appearances to nearby structures such as tendons. Several recent studies have highlighted the potential of near-infrared optical spectroscopy for differentiating nerves and adjacent tissues, as this modality can be sensitive to optical absorption of lipids that are present in intra- and extra-neural adipose tissue and in the myelin sheaths. These studies were limited to point measurements, however. In this pilot study, a custom photoacoustic system with a clinical ultrasound imaging probe was used to acquire multi-spectral photoacoustic images of nerves and tendons from swine ex vivo, across the wavelength range of 1100 to 1300 nm. Photoacoustic images were processed and overlaid in colour onto co-registered conventional ultrasound images that were acquired with the same imaging probe. A pronounced optical absorption peak centred at 1210 nm was observed in the photoacoustic signals obtained from nerves, and it was absent in those obtained from tendons. This absorption peak, which is consistent with the presence of lipids, provides a novel image contrast mechanism to significantly enhance the visualization of nerves. In particular, image contrast for nerves was up to 5.5 times greater with photoacoustic imaging (0.82 ± 0.15) than with conventional ultrasound imaging (0.148 ± 0.002), with a maximum contrast of 0.95 ± 0.02 obtained in photoacoustic mode. This pilot study demonstrates the potential of photoacoustic imaging to improve clinical outcomes in ultrasound-guided interventions in regional anaesthesia and interventional oncology. © 2014 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

However, the progress in clinic has been slower and less efficient than expected. This suggests a need for further development using carefully designed chemical components to improve usefulness under clinical conditions and maximize therapeutic effect. For cancer chemotherapy, PEGylated liposomes were the first nanomedicine to reach the market and have been used clinically for several years. Approaches toward targeted drug delivery using next generation ""thermally triggered"" nanoparticles are now in clinical trials. However, clinically tested thermosensitive liposomes (TSLs) lack the markers that allow tumor labeling and improved imaging for tissue specific applied hyperthermia. Here we describe the development of optically labeled TSLs for image guidance drug delivery and proof-of-concept results for their application in the treatment of murine xenograft tumors using the anticancer drug topotecan. These labeled TSLs also allow the simultaneous, real-time diagnostic imaging of nanoparticle biodistribution using a near-infrared (NIR; 750-950 nm) fluorophore coupled to a lipidic component of the lipid bilayer. When combined with multispectral fluorescence analysis, this allows for specific and high sensitivity tracking of the nanoparticles in vivo.

We show that ultrasound frequency-dependent artifacts suppress multispectral features and complicate spectral analysis. In response, we employ a wavelet decomposition to perform spectral unmixing on a per-scale basis (or per ultrasound frequency band) and showcase imaging of fine-scale features otherwise hidden by low frequency components.

Recent work has suggested that this approach may be extended to allow surgical attachment of larger tissue segments for applications such as bowel anastomosis. In a large series of porcine surgical procedures bipolar RF energy was used to resect and re-seal the small bowel in vivo with a commercial tissue fusion device (Ligasure; Covidien PLC, USA). The tissue was then imaged with a multispectral imaging laparoscope to obtain a spectral datacube comprising both fused and healthy tissue. Maps of blood volume, oxygen saturation and scattering power were derived from the measured reflectance spectra using an optimised lighttissue interaction model. A 60% increase in reflectance of visible light (460-700 nm) was observed after fusion, with the tissue taking on a white appearance. Despite this the distinctive shape of the haemoglobin absorption spectrum was still noticeable in the 460- 600 nm wavelength range. Scattering power increased in the fused region in comparison to normal serosa, while blood volume and oxygen saturation decreased. Observed fusion-induced changes in the reflectance spectrum are consistent with the biophysical changes induced through tissue denaturation and increased collagen cross-linking. The multispectral imager allows mapping of the spatial extent of these changes and classification of the zone of damaged tissue. Further analysis of the spectral data in parallel with histopathological examination of excised specimens will allow correlation of the optical property changes with microscopic alterations in tissue structure. © 2015 SPIE-OSA.","OSA - The Optical Society","Conference paper","","Scopus"

In vitro evaluation of two-dimensional cells and three-dimensional tumor spheroids revealed that DGlu-NP/PTX was more potent than those of plain nanoparticles (NP/PTX) and Taxol.

In certain procedures, where nerves show visual resemblance to surrounding adipose tissue, this can be particularly challenging for the human eye. An example of such a delicate procedure is thyroid and parathyroid surgery, where iatrogenic injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve can result in transient or permanent vocal problems (0.5-2.0% reported incidence). A camera system, enabling nerve-specific image enhancement, would be useful in preventing such complications. This might be realized with hyperspectral camera technology using silicon (Si) or indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) sensor chips. Methods As a first step towards such a camera, we evaluated the performance of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy by analysing spectra collected during 18 thyroid and parathyroid resections. We assessed the contrast information present in two different spectral ranges, for respectively Si and InGaAs sensors. Two hundred fifty three in vivo, wide-band diffuse reflectance spectra (350-1,830 nm range, 1 nm resolution) were acquired on 52 tissue spots, including nerve (n = 22), muscle (n = 12), and adipose tissue (n = 18). We extracted 36 features from these spectroscopic data: 18 gradients and 18 amplitude differences at predefined points in the tissue spectra. Best distinctive feature combinations were established using binary logistic regression. Classification performance was evaluated in a cross-validation (CV) approach by leave-one-out (LOO). To generalize nerve recognition applicability, we performed a train-test (TT) validation using the thyroid and parathyroid surgery data for training purposes and carpal tunnel release surgery data (10 nerve spots and 5 adipose spots) for classification purposes. Results For combinations of two distinctive spectral features, LOO revealed an accuracy of respectively 78% for Si-sensors and 95% for InGaAs-sensors. TT revealed accuracies of respectively 67% and 100%. Conclusions Using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy we have identified that InGaAs sensors are better suited for automated discrimination between nerves and surrounding adipose tissue than Si sensors. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","John Wiley and Sons Inc.","Article","","Scopus"

Most IMCLs organize into lipid droplets (LDs), the fates of which are regulated by lipid droplet coat proteins. Perilipin 5 (PLIN5) is an LD coating protein, which is strongly linked to lipid storage in muscle tissue. Here we employ a tandem in vitro/ex vivo approach and use chemical imaging by label-free, hyperspectral coherent Raman microscopy to quantify compositional changes in individual LDs upon PLIN5 overexpression. Our results directly show that PLIN5 overexpression in muscle alters individual LD composition and physiology, resulting in larger LDs with higher esterified acyl chain concentration, increased methylene content, and more saturated lipid species. These results suggest that lipotoxic protection afforded by natural PLIN5 upregulation in muscle involves molecular changes in lipid composition within LDs.

Absorption and scattering of the near infrared excitation light modulates the spectral profile of light as it propagates deep into biological tissue, meaning the images obtained provide only qualitative insight into the distribution of tissue chromophores. The goal of this work is to accurately recover the spectral profile of excitation light by modelling light fluence in the data reconstruction, to enable quantitative imaging. We worked with a commercial small animal MSOT scanner and developed our light fluence correction for its' cylindrical geometry. Optoacoustic image reconstruction pinpoints the sources of acoustic waves detected by the transducers and returns the initial pressure amplitude at these points. This pressure is the product of the dimensionless Grüneisen parameter, the absorption coefficient and the light fluence. Under the condition of constant Grüneisen parameter and well modelled light fluence, there is a linear relationship between the initial pressure amplitude measured in the optoacoustic image and the absorption coefficient. We were able to reproduce this linear relationship in different physical regions of an agarose gel phantom containing targets of known optical absorption coefficient, demonstrating that our light fluence model was working. We also demonstrate promising results of light fluence correction effects on in vivo data. © 2015 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

These procedures include fetal interventions, tumor biopsies and treatments, central venous catheterisations and peripheral nerve blocks. Ultrasound imaging is commonly used for guidance, but it often provides insufficient contrast with which to identify soft tissue structures such as vessels, tumors, and nerves. In this study, a hybrid interventional imaging system that combines ultrasound imaging and multispectral photoacoustic imaging for guiding minimally invasive procedures was developed and characterized. The system provides both structural information from ultrasound imaging and molecular information from multispectral photoacoustic imaging. It uses a commercial linear-array ultrasound imaging probe as the ultrasound receiver, with a multimode optical fiber embedded in a needle to deliver pulsed excitation light to tissue. Co-registration of ultrasound and photoacoustic images is achieved with the use of the same ultrasound receiver for both modalities.

To achieve this, two or more excitation wavelengths are employed to sequentially illuminate tissue. Due to depth-related spectral dependencies and detection related effects, the multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) spectral unmixing problem presents a complex non-linear inversion operation. So far, different studies have showcased the spectral capacity of optoacoustic imaging, without however relating the performance achieved to the number of wavelengths employed. Overall, the dependence of the sensitivity and accuracy of optoacoustic imaging as a function of the number of illumination wavelengths has not been so far comprehensively studied. In this paper we study the impact of the number of excitation wavelengths employed on the sensitivity and accuracy achieved by molecular optoacoustic tomography. We present a quantitative analysis, based on synthetic MSOT datasets and observe a trend of sensitivity increase for up to 20 wavelengths. Importantly we quantify this relation and demonstrate an up to an order of magnitude sensitivity increase of multi-wavelength illumination vs. single or dual wavelength optoacoustic imaging.

Sickle red blood cells (SSRBCs) have shown an ability to target such hypoxic niches and induce tumoricidal effects when used together with exogenous pro-oxidants. Here we determine whether the delivery of a model therapeutic encapsulated in murine SSRBCs can be enhanced by ex vivo photo sensitization under conditions that delay autohemolysis to a time that coincides with maximal localization of SSRBCs in a hypoxic tumor. Hyperspectral imaging of 4T1 carcinomas shows oxygen saturation levels <10% in a large fraction (commonly 50% or more) of the tumor. Using video microscopy of dorsal skin window chambers implanted with 4T1 tumors, we demonstrate that allogeneic SSRBCs, but not normal RBCs (nRBCs), selectively accumulate in hypoxic 4T1 tumors between 12 and 24 h after systemic administration. We further show that ex vivo photo-oxidation can program SSRBCs to postpone hemolysis/release of a model therapeutic to a point that coincides with their maximum sequestration in hypoxic tumor microvessels. Under these conditions, drug-loaded photosensitized SSRBCs show a 3-4 fold greater drug delivery to tumors compared to non-photosensitized SSRBCs, drug-loaded photosensitized nRBCs, and free drug. These results demonstrate that photo-oxidized SSRBCs, but not photo-oxidized nRBCs, sequester and hemolyze in hypoxic tumors and release substantially more drug than photo-oxidized nRBCs and non-photo-oxidized SSRBCs. Photo-oxidation of drug-loaded SSRBCs thus appears to exploit the unique tumor targeting and carrier properties of SSRBCs to optimize drug delivery to hypoxic tumors. Such programmed and drug-loaded SSRBCs therefore represent a novel and useful tool for augmenting drug delivery to hypoxic solid tumors. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy can provide quantitative biochemical and morphological information for tissue characterization. The diffuse reflectance data is influenced by the functional state of matter, which affects the optical properties. White light is used to measure these changes in optical properties which in turn give an idea about the region under scan. Optical imaging has been gaining importance especially in medical field. An optical fibre spectrometer is set up to obtain the reflectance data. Reflectance probe is mounted on a movable mechanism with two degrees of freedom which is controlled by a Programmable Logic Control (PLC) unit. PLC unit contains Human-Machine interface (HMI) to feed in manually the dimension of the area to be scanned, scan speed (thereby resolution) with which scanner arm is to be moved. This automation could avoid overlapping of data during scanning. Codes are written in MATLAB to display the direct reflected intensity images, functional images and multispectral images. The reflected intensity images give the structural details of the region under scan. The functional imaging enables to measure the physiological changes (change in molar concentrations of oxy-hemoglobin, deoxy-hemoglobin and oxygenation state) in tissue under diseased conditions. The multispectral imaging helps to visualize the changes in the optical properties of tissues at any particular wavelength underneath the region of scan in turn, aiding in disease diagnosis. The unique information obtained from the diffuse reflectance spectroscopy makes it suitable for a variety of clinical applications.

A complete removal of malignant tissue and conservation of healthy tissue is important for the preservation of organ function, patient satisfaction, and quality of life. Visual inspection and palpation is not sufficient for discriminating between malignant and normal tissue types. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology has the potential to noninvasively delineate surgical tumor margin and can be used as an intra-operative visual aid tool. Since histological images provide the ground truth of cancer margins, it is necessary to warp the cancer regions in ex vivo histological images back to in vivo hyperspectral images in order to validate the tumor margins detected by HSI and to optimize the imaging parameters. In this paper, principal component analysis (PCA) is utilized to extract the principle component bands of the HSI images, which is then used to register HSI images with the corresponding histological image. Affine registration is chosen to model the global transformation. A B-spline free form deformation (FFD) method is used to model the local non-rigid deformation. Registration experiment was performed on animal hyperspectral and histological images. Experimental results from animals demonstrated the feasibility of the hyperspectral imaging method for cancer margin detection. © 2014 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This study established a method for fluorescent tracking of the degradation of a chitosan membrane scaffold for use in vitro in bioreactors and ultimately in vivo. The basis of this tracking system is a fluorescence emitting biomaterial obtained by covalent binding of the fluorophore tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) onto the backbone of chitosan. Using confocal microscopy, this study quantitated the reductions in fluorescence intensity of the membrane and correlated these decreases with weight loss during polymer breakdown, thereby providing a technique for non-destructively assessing the extent of degradation of chitosan materials over time in vitro. Using multispectral imaging in a mouse model, the study assessed the degradation profile of the fluorophore-labeled biomaterial in vivo in real time and identified the dispersing pathway of the chitosan membrane degradation products in vivo. The results revealed that TRITC conjugated chitosan was biocompatible and supported bone cell growth.

This yeast interacts closely with innate immune cells, leading to various fates, including fungal persistence within cells, making possible the dissemination of the yeast cells with monocytes via a Trojan horse strategy. In humans, the natural history of the infection begins with primoinfection during childhood, which is followed by dormancy and, in some individuals, reactivation upon immunosuppression. To address the question of dormancy, we studied C. neoformans infection at the macrophage level (in vitro H99- macrophage interaction) and at the organ level in a murine model of cryptococcosis. We analyzed the diversity of yeast adaptation to the host by characterizing several C. neoformans populations with new assays based on flow cytometry (quantitative flow cytometry, multispectral imaging flow cytometry, sorting), microscopy (dynamic imaging), and gene expression analysis. On the basis of parameters of multiplication and stress response, various populations of yeast cells were observed over time in vivo and in vitro. Cell sorting allowed the identification of a subpopulation that was less prone to grow under standard conditions than the other populations, with growth enhanced by the addition of serum. Gene expression analysis revealed that this population had specific metabolic characteristics that could reflect dormancy. Our data suggest that dormant yeast cells could exist in vitro and in vivo. C. neoformans exhibits a huge plasticity and adaptation to hosts that deserves further study. In vitro generation of dormant cells is now the main challenge to overcome the limited number of yeast cells recovered in our models. IMPORTANCE Cryptococcus neoformans is a sugar-coated unicellular fungus that interacts closely with various cells and organisms, including amoebas, nematodes, and immune cells of mammals. This yeast is able to proliferate and survive in the intracellular environment. C. neoformans causes cryptococcosis, and yeast dormancy in humans has been suggested on the basis of epidemiological evidence obtained years ago. By studying an in vitro model of yeast-macrophage interaction and murine models of cryptococcosis, we observed that yeast cells evolve in heterogeneous populations during infection on the basis of global metabolic activity. We compared the growth ability and gene expression of yeast cells belonging to various populations in those two models. We eventually found a population of yeast cells with low metabolism that fit some of the criteria for dormant cells. This paves the way for further characterization of dormancy in C. neoformans. © 2015 Alanio et al.","American Society for Microbiology","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

As these images can be obtained at multiple wavelengths, quantitatively accurate, spatially resolved, estimates for chromophore concentration, for example, may be obtainable. Such a capability would find a wide range of clinical and pre-clinical applications. However, despite a growing body of theoretical papers on how this might be achieved, there is a noticeable lack of studies providing validated evidence that it can be achieved experimentally, either in vitro or in vivo. Well-defined, versatile and stable phantom materials are essential to assess the accuracy, robustness and applicability of multispectral Quantitative Photoacoustic Imaging (qPAI) algorithms in experimental scenarios. This study assesses the potential of polyvinyl chloride plastisol (PVCP) as a phantom material for qPAI, building on previous work that focused on using PVCP for quality control. Parameters that might be controlled or tuned to assess the performance of qPAI algorithms were studied: broadband acoustic properties, multiwavelength optical properties with added absorbers and scatterers, and photoacoustic efficiency. The optical and acoustic properties of PVCP can be tuned to be broadly representative of soft tissue. The Grüneisen parameter is larger than expected in tissue, which is an advantage as it increases the signal-to-noise ratio of the photoacoustic measurements. Interestingly, when the absorption was altered by adding absorbers, the absorption spectra measured using high peak power nanosecond-pulsed sources (typical in photoacoustics) were repeatably different from the ones measured using the low power source in the spectrophotometer, indicative of photochemical reactions taking place. © 2015 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Circulating monocytes and hepatic macrophages are central mediators of inflammatory responses and tissue repair processes during human AALF. Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) modulates monocyte/macrophage function through inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling. The aims of this study were to establish the role of SLPI in AALF. Circulating levels of SLPI, monocyte cluster of differentiation 163 (CD163), human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated levels of NF-κBp65, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-6 were determined in patients with AALF, chronic liver disease, and healthy controls. Immunohistochemistry and multispectral imaging of AALF explant tissue determined the cellular sources of SLPI and hepatic macrophage phenotype. The phenotype and function of monocytes and macrophages was determined following culture with recombinant human (rh)-SLPI, liver homogenates, and plasma derived from AALF patients in the presence and absence of antihuman (α)SLPI. Hepatic and circulatory concentrations of SLPI were elevated in AALF and immunohistochemistry revealed SLPI expression in biliary epithelial cells and within hepatic macrophages (h-mψ) in areas of necrosis. H-mψ and circulating monocytes in AALF exhibited an anti-inflammatory phenotype and functional characteristics; typified by reductions in NF-κBp65, TNF-α, and IL-6 and preserved IL-10 secretion following LPS challenge. Culture of healthy monocytes with AALF liver homogenates, plasma, or rhSLPI induced monocytes with strikingly similar anti-inflammatory characteristics which were reversed by inhibiting the activity of SLPI. Conclusion: SLPI is a pivotal mediator of anti-inflammatory responses in AALF through modulation of monocyte/macrophage function, which may account for the susceptibility to sepsis in AALF. © 2014 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","Article","","Scopus"

Three samples of colorectal carcinomas treated by radiochemotherapy together with one untreated sample are analyzed ex vivo before fixation in formalin by using a multispectral Mueller polarimetric imaging system operated from 500 to 700 nm. The Mueller images, analyzed using the Lu-Chipmann decomposition, show negligible diattenuation and retardation. The nonirradiated rectum exhibits a variation of depolarization with cancer evolution stage. At all wavelengths on irradiated samples, the contrast between the footprint of the initial tumor and surrounding healthy tissue is found to be much smaller for complete tumor regression than when a residual tumor is present, even at volume fractions of the order of 5%. This high sensitivity is attributed to the modification of stromal collagen induced by the cancer. The depolarization contrast between treated cancer and healthy tissue is found to increase monotonously with the volume fraction of residual cancer in the red part of the spectrum. Polarimetric imaging is a promising technique for detecting short-time small residual cancers, which is valuable information for pathological diagnosis and patient management by clinicians. © 2013 The Authors.","","Article","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Fifty patients undergoing thyroidectomy because of thyroid lesions participated in this study. Multispectral photoacoustic imaging was performed on surgically excised thyroid tissue, and chromophore images that represented optical absorption of deoxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, lipid, and water were reconstructed. After the imaging procedure, the pathologist marked malignant tissue, benign nodules, and normal regions on histopathologic slides, and digital images of the marked histopathologic slides were obtained. The histopathologic images were coregistered with chromophore images. Areas corresponding to malignant tissue, benign nodules, and normal tissue were defined on the chromophore images. Pixel values within each area were averaged to determine the mean intensities of deoxyhemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin, lipid, and water. RESULTS. There was a statistically significant difference between malignant and benign nodules with respect to mean intensity of deoxyhemoglobin (p = 0.014). There was a difference between malignant and normal tissue in mean intensity of deoxyhemoglobin (p = 0.003), lipid (p = 0.001), and water (p < 0.0001). A difference between benign nodules and normal tissue was found in mean intensity of oxyhemoglobin (p < 0.0001), lipid (p < 0.0001), and water (p < 0.0001). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the system tested in differentiating malignant from nonmalignant thyroid tissue were 69.2%, 96.9%, 81.8%, and 93.9%. CONCLUSION. The preliminary results of this ex vivo human thyroid study suggest that multispectral photoacoustic imaging can be used to differentiate malignant and benign nodules and normal human thyroid tissue. © American Roentgen Ray Society.","American Roentgen Ray Society","Article","","Scopus"

We have designed and are constructing a dual modality Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Multispectral Fluorescence Imaging (MFI) endoscope to optically screen the Fallopian tube and ovary for early stage cancer. The endoscope reaches the ovary via the natural pathway of the vagina, cervix, uterus and Fallopian tube. In order to navigate the Fallopian tube the endoscope must have an outer diameter of 600 μm, be highly flexible, steerable, tracking and nonperforating. The imaging systems consists of six optical subsystems, two from OCT and four from MFI. The optical subsystems have independent and interrelated design criteria. The endoscope will be tested on realistic tissue models and ex vivo tissue to prove feasibility of future human trials.

Multispectral imaging and analysis have been used in the literature to detect spectral variations in tissue reflectance that may be visible to the naked eye. Using this technique, hidden structures can be visualized and analyzed for effective tissue classification. Here, we investigated the feasibility of automated tissue classification using multispectral tissue analysis. Broadband reflectance spectra (200-1050 nm) were collected from nine different ex vivo porcine tissues types using an optical fiber-probe based spectrometer system. We created a mathematical model to train and distinguish different tissue types based upon analysis of the observed spectra using total principal component regression (TPCR). Compared to other reported methods, our technique is computationally inexpensive and suitable for real-time implementation. Each of the 92 spectra was cross-referenced against the nine tissue types. Preliminary results show a mean detection rate of 91.3%, with detection rates of 100% and 70.0% (inner and outer kidney), 100% and 100% (inner and outer liver), 100% (outer stomach), and 90.9%, 100%, 70.0%, 85.7% (four different inner stomach areas, respectively). We conclude that automated tissue differentiation using our multispectral tissue analysis method is feasible in multiple ex vivo tissue specimens. Although measurements were performed using ex vivo tissues, these results suggest that real-time, in vivo tissue identification during surgery may be possible.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

This review summarizes reports about current prototypes that were applied in vivo in humans. Methods: Four databases were searched for reports about prototypes of photoacoustic breast tomography that were tested in vivo in humans. Data extracted from the reports comprised details about system design, phantom studies, and clinical studies. Results: Five prototypes were included. System designs comprised planar, hemicylindrical and hemispherical geometries. In total, 52 of 61 breast cancers (85 %) were detected by three of the prototypes, showing image details such as ring-pattern of the haemoglobin-rich tumour vasculature. A refined prototype provided submillimetre resolution at a good contrast-to-noise ratio up to a depth of about 5 cm in a cup-shaped breast configuration. Another novel prototype demonstrated that in the mammographic imaging geometry, the total imaging depth approximately duplicates with bilateral laser illumination. Most prototypes focused on detecting elevated haemoglobin content related to tumours, but proof-of-principle was also given for multispectral optoacoustic tomography by additional imaging of tissue oxygenation. Conclusions: Photoacoustic breast tomography can detect breast cancer. This radiation-free molecular imaging technology should be further refined and studied for clinical applications. Key Points: • Photoacoustics combines optical imaging with sonographic signal detection. • Photoacoustic tomography could provide molecular imaging at high image resolution. • Prototypes have been designed for human breast cancer imaging. • Preliminary evaluation studies show that photoacoustic tomography detects breast cancer. • This radiation-free method should be further improved and studied for clinical applications. © 2015, European Society of Radiology.","Springer Verlag","Review","","Scopus"

Discrimination between tumour and inflammation could be therefore difficult. Improvement of fluorescence diagnosis through observation of cell metabolism could be the solution, which needs a detailed understanding of the origin of autofluorescence. However, a complex combination of fluorophores give rise to the emission signal. Also in PDD (photodynamic diagnosis) different photosensitizer metabolites contribute to the fluorescence signal. Therefore, the fluorescence decay in many cases does not show a simple monoexponential profile. In those cases a considerable improvement could be achieved when time-resolved and spectral-resolved techniques are simultaneously incorporated. The discussion will focus on the detection of NADH, FAD and 5-ALA induced porphyrins. With respect to NADH and FAD the discrimination between protein bound and free coenzyme was investigated with multispectral FLIM in normal oral keratinocytes and squamous carcinoma cells from different origin. The redox ratio, which can be correlated with the fluorescence lifetimes of NADH and FAD changed depending on the state of the cells. Most of the investigations were done in monolayer cell cultures.

However, many clinical imaging systems have limitations and fail to provide noninvasive, real time, and quantitative assessment of biological tissue in an operation room. To overcome these limitations, we developed and tested a multiview hyperspectral imaging system. The multiview hyperspectral imaging system integrated the multiview and the hyperspectral imaging techniques in a single portable unit. Four plane mirrors are cohered together as a multiview reflective mirror set with a rectangular cross section. The multiview reflective mirror set was placed between a hyperspectral camera and the measured biological tissue. For a single image acquisition task, a hyperspectral data cube with five views was obtained. The five-view hyperspectral image consisted of a main objective image and four reflective images. Three-dimensional topography of the scene was achieved by correlating the matching pixels between the objective image and the reflective images. Three-dimensional mapping of tissue oxygenation was achieved using a hyperspectral oxygenation algorithm. The multiview hyperspectral imaging technique is currently under quantitative validation in a wound model, a tissue-simulating blood phantom, and an in vivo biological tissue model. The preliminary results have demonstrated the technical feasibility of using multiview hyperspectral imaging for three-dimensional topography of tissue functional properties. © Copyright SPIE.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Light at multiple optical wavelengths between 700 and 900 nmwas delivered to the treated bovine muscle tissue to excite the photoacoustic signal. Apparent tissue denaturation has been observed in multispectral photoacoustic images after being treated in a water bath and by HIFU. It is interesting that the denaturation is more striking at shorter optical wavelength photoacoustic images than at longer optical wavelength photoacoustic images.

Fast 3-D data acquisition is realized through a time multiplexing approach based on a parallel lighting configuration - our system can achieve 0.12ms per source per wavelength and up to 14Hz sampling rate for a full set of data for 3-D DOT image reconstruction. The system is validated using both static and dynamic tissue-like phantoms. In vivo rat experiments using both focal and generalized models of seizure are also demonstrated. In the focal seizure experiment, hemodynamic seizure focus was clearly detected and tracked. In the generalized seizure experiment, early hemodynamic responses with heterogeneous patterns were detected several minutes preceding the EEG onset of seizures and widespread hemodynamic changes were found evolving from local regions. Connectivity changes were also found during the development of seizures. This study demonstrates that DOT represents a powerful tool for investigating seizure generation and propagation, elucidating the causes and mechanism of seizures. © 2013 Copyright SPIE.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Adult C57BL/6 mice were exposed via single intratracheal instillations to free forms of TiO2NPs (10, 20.6, or 38 nm in diameter) with different surface coatings, or TiO2NPs embedded in paint matrices. Controls were exposed to dispersion medium devoid of NPs. TiO2NPs were characterized for size, surface area, chemical impurities, and agglomeration state in the exposure medium. Pulmonary transcriptional profiles were generated using microarrays from tissues collected one and 28 d postexposure. Property-specific pathway effects were identified. Pulmonary protein levels of specific inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were confirmed by ELISA. The data were collapsed to 659 differentially expressed genes (P ≤ 0.05; fold change ≥ 1.5). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of these genes revealed that TiO2NPs clustered mainly by postexposure timepoint followed by particle type. A pathway-based meta-analysis showed that the combination of smaller size, large deposited surface area, and surface amidation contributes to TiO2NP gene expression response. Embedding of TiO2NP in paint dampens the overall transcriptional effects. The magnitude of the expression changes associated with pulmonary inflammation differed across all particles; however, the underlying pathway perturbations leading to inflammation were similar, suggesting a generalized mechanism-of-action for all TiO2NPs.

Fortunately, the survival rate for early-diagnosed patients is relatively high. Therefore, in vivo imaging plays an important role for the detection and treatment of the disease. Accurate prostate cancer localization with noninvasive imaging can be used to guide biopsy, radiotherapy, and surgery as well as to monitor disease progression. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed with an endorectal coil provides higher prostate cancer localization accuracy, when compared to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). However, in general, a single type of MRI is not sufficient for reliable tumor localization. As an alternative, multispectral MRI, i.e., the use of multiple MRI-derived datasets, has emerged as a promising noninvasive imaging technique for the localization of prostate cancer; however, almost all studies are with human readers. There is a significant inter- and intra-observer variability for human readers, and it is substantially difficult for humans to analyze the large dataset of multispectral MRI. To solve these problems, this study presents an automated localization method. We first perform tests to see the best performing combination of multiparametric MRI, then develop localization methods using cost-sensitive support vector machines (SVMs), and show that this method results in improved localization accuracy than classical SVM. Additionally, we develop a new segmentation method by combining conditional random fields (CRF) with a cost-sensitive framework and show that our method further improves cost-sensitive SVM (C-SVM) results by incorporating spatial information. We test SVM, C-SVM, and the proposed cost-sensitive CRF on multispectral MRI datasets acquired from 21 biopsy-confirmed cancer patients. Our results show that multispectral MRI helps to increase the accuracy of prostate cancer localization when compared to single MR images and that using advanced methods such as C-SVM as well as the proposed cost-sensitive CRF can boost the performance significantly when compared to SVM. We finally discuss potentially effective methods of localization using texture as the next steps of research. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.","Springer US","Book chapter","","Scopus"

Retinal hemorrhages (RHs) and vascular abnormalities can serve as diagnostic indicators of head trauma. Ensuring an accurate and complete diagnosis of the trauma requires a quantitative description of the hemorrhages. In this work, we describe an optical interferometry-based photoacoustic (PA) microscope (PAM) to remotely evaluate retinal tissue at sub-micron resolution with an ultra-broadband detection bandwidth (1 GHz). To demonstrate feasibility, ex-vivo porcine retina specimens containing typical blood-vessel networks were imaged using our all-optical PAM. PA signals were generated in the tissue by a 532-nm pulsed laser, and PA-induced broadband ultrasound signals were detected at the surface of the specimen using an optical interferometer operating at 532 nm. K-space reconstruction methods were employed to obtain the tissue properties by time-reversing and back-propagating the measured signals into the medium. A tunable pulsed laser was employed to perform multispectral PA imaging of the vasculature to demonstrate feasibility of measuring blood volume, oxygen concentration and lipids. Multispectral PA data were obtained to a depth of 5 mm, in raster-scanned steps of 50 microns over the wavelength range of 680 to 950 nm. © 2014 IEEE.","IEEE Computer Society","Conference paper","","Scopus"

A complete set of polarization parameters was derived. The combination of linear depolarization and linear retardance yields the highest accuracy in sample classification. When the depolarization of linearly polarized light due to scattering is independent of the orientation angle of the incident linear polarization vector, the derivation of linear polarization properties will require only 3 × 3 Mueller matrix, which would significantly reduce the complexity of the polarimetry imaging system. When additional parameters are needed to complement the two linear polarization parameters, retardance, circular depolarization, and depolarization can be included in classification in the order of preference. However, these additional parameters would require the measurement of 4 × 4 Mueller matrix.

The recent development in nanotechnology offers a new opportunity for real-time study of reproductive cells in their physiological environments. As a first step toward that goal, we evaluated the effectiveness of a fluorescent and luminescent nanoparticle for in vitro and ex vivo imaging of porcine gametes. Methods: Freshly harvested boar sperm were labeled with red-shifted (655 nm) quantum dot nanoparticles conjugated (QD+) or not (QD-) with plasminogen antibody and evaluated. Subsets of labeled spermatozoa were loaded into straws and placed within the lumen of gilt reproductive tracts for ex vivo intra-uterine imaging. Porcine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were matured in the presence of QD- or QD+. Ovarian follicles were microinjected with QD- or QD+ and placed in culture for up to 4 days. After labeling, all samples were supplemented with coelenterazine, the luciferase substrate, and immediately submitted to bioluminescence analysis, followed by fluorescence and hyperspectral imaging. Data were analyzed with ANOVA and P < 0.05 indicated significant differences. Results: All labeled-samples revealed bioluminescence emission that was confirmed by fluorescence and hyperspectral imaging of the QD localization within the cells and tissues. Over 76% of spermatozoa and both immature and mature COCs were successfully labeled with QD- or QD+. The QD- fluorescence appeared homogenously distributed in the oocytes, while found in the entire sperm length with a higher accumulation within the mid-piece. Labeled-follicles exhibited a progressive migration of QD nanoparticles within the follicle wall during culture. In contrast, QD+ fluorescence signals appeared condensed and stronger in the follicle cells, sperm head, and sub-plasma membrane area of mature oocytes. Weaker QD+ signals were detected in the cumulus cells. Fluorescence and hyperspectral microscope imaging showed comparable intracellular QD localization. Ex-vivo intra-uterine bioluminescence imaging of labeled spermatozoa revealed stronger signals captured over the oviducts, with uterine body allowing the lowest signal detection. Conclusion: Findings indicate that conjugated and non-conjugated fluorescent nanoparticles can be used for effective labeling of mammalian gametes for in vitro monitoring and potential in vivo targeted-imaging. © 2015 Feugang et al.","BioMed Central Ltd.","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

These procedures include fetal interventions, tumor biopsies and treatments, central venous catheterisations and peripheral nerve blocks. Ultrasound imaging is commonly used for guidance, but it often provides insufficient contrast with which to identify soft tissue structures such as vessels, tumors, and nerves. In this study, a hybrid interventional imaging system that combines ultrasound imaging and multispectral photoacoustic imaging for guiding minimally invasive procedures was developed and characterized. The system provides both structural information from ultrasound imaging and molecular information from multispectral photoacoustic imaging. It uses a commercial linear-array ultrasound imaging probe as the ultrasound receiver, with a multimode optical fiber embedded in a needle to deliver pulsed excitation light to tissue. Co-registration of ultrasound and photoacoustic images is achieved with the use of the same ultrasound receiver for both modalities.Using tissue ex vivo, the system successfully discriminated deep-located fat tissue from the surrounding muscle tissue.

A Monte Carlo simulation-based multiple regression analysis for the corresponding spectral absorbance images at nine wavelengths (500, 520, 540, 560, 570, 580, 600, 730, and 760 nm) was then used to specify the absorption and scattering parameters of brain tissue. In this analysis, the concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin and that of deoxygenated hemoglobin were estimated as the absorption parameters, whereas the coefficient a and the exponent b of the reduced scattering coefficient spectrum approximated by a power law function were estimated as the scattering parameters. The spectra of absorption and reduced scattering coefficients were reconstructed from the absorption and scattering parameters, and the spectral images of absorption and reduced scattering coefficients were then estimated. In order to confirm the feasibility of this method, we performed in vivo experiments on exposed rat brain. The estimated images of the absorption coefficients were dominated by the spectral characteristics of hemoglobin. The estimated spectral images of the reduced scattering coefficients had a broad scattering spectrum, exhibiting a larger magnitude at shorter wavelengths, corresponding to the typical spectrum of brain tissue published in the literature. The changes in the estimated absorption and scattering parameters during normoxia, hyperoxia, and anoxia indicate the potential applicability of the method by which to evaluate the pathophysiological conditions of in vivo brain due to the loss of tissue viability. © 2015 The Authors.","SPIE","Article","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Therapeutic success remains elusive, however, because of inhomogeneous particle distribution within tumor tissue. Insufficient tumor vascularization limits particle transport and also results in avascular hypoxic regions with non-proliferating cells, which can regenerate tissue after nanoparticle-delivered cytotoxicity or thermal ablation. Nanoparticle surface modifications provide for increasing tumor targeting and uptake while decreasing immunogenicity and toxicity. Herein, we created novel two layer gold-nanoshell particles coated with alkanethiol and phosphatidylcholine, and three layer nanoshells additionally coated with high-density-lipoprotein. We hypothesize that these particles have enhanced penetration into 3-dimensional cell cultures modeling avascular tissue when compared to standard poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-coated nanoshells. Particle uptake and distribution in liver, lung, and pancreatic tumor cell cultures were evaluated using silver-enhancement staining and hyperspectral imaging with dark field microscopy. Two layer nanoshells exhibited significantly higher uptake compared to PEGylated nanoshells.

The methods such as X-rays, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have played an important role in preoperative accurate diagnosis. However, most of them are inapplicable for intraoperative surgery. We have proposed a surgical navigation system based on optical molecular imaging technology for intraoperative detection of tumors and metastasis. This system collects images from two CCD cameras for real-time fluorescent and color imaging. For image processing, the template matching algorithm is used for multispectral image fusion. For the application of tumor detection, the mouse breast cancer cell line 4T1-luc, which shows highly metastasis, was used for tumor model establishment and a model of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expressing breast cancer. The tumor-bearing nude mice were given tail vein injection of MMP 750FAST (PerkinElmer, Inc. USA) probe and imaged with both bioluminescence and fluorescence to assess in vivo binding of the probe to the tumor and metastases sites. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed to confirm the presence of tumor and metastasis. As a result, one tumor can be observed visually in vivo. However liver metastasis has been detected under surgical navigation system and all were confirmed by histology. This approach helps surgeons to find orthotopic tumors and metastasis during intraoperative resection and visualize tumor borders for precise positioning. Further investigation is needed for future application in clinics.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

The use of ICG-loaded microballoons in biliary imaging is demonstrated in both biliary-simulating phantoms and an ex vivo tissue model. The biliary-simulating phantoms are prepared by embedding ICG-loaded microballoons in agar gel and imaged by a fluorescence imaging module in a Da Vinci surgical robot. The ex vivo model consists of liver, gallbladder, common bile duct, and part of the duodenum freshly dissected from a domestic swine. After ICG-loaded microballoons are injected into the gallbladder, the biliary structure is imaged by both hyperspectral and fluorescence imaging modalities.

While fluorescence imaging provides dynamic information of movement and flow in the surgical region of interest, data from hyperspectral imaging allow for rapid identification of the bile duct and safe exclusion of any contaminant fluorescence from tissue not part of the biliary anatomy.

However, existing single-spectral and multispectral methods are not very efficient and effective at reconstructing the distribution of the radionuclide tracer. In this paper, we present a semi-quantitative Cerenkov radiation spectral characteristic-based source reconstruction method named the hybrid spectral CLT, to efficiently reconstruct the radionuclide tracer with both encouraging reconstruction results and less acquisition and image reconstruction time. Methodology/Principal Findings: We constructed the implantation mouse model implanted with a 400 μCi Na131I radioactive source and the physiological mouse model received an intravenous tail injection of 400 μCi radiopharmaceutical Iodine-131 (I-131) to validate the performance of the hybrid spectral CLT and compared the reconstruction results, acquisition, and image reconstruction time with that of single-spectral and multispectral CLT. Furthermore, we performed 3D noninvasive monitoring of I-131 uptake in the thyroid and quantified I-131 uptake in vivo using hybrid spectral CLT. Results showed that the reconstruction based on the hybrid spectral CLT was more accurate in localization and quantification than using single-spectral CLT, and was more efficient in the in vivo experiment compared with multispectral CLT. Additionally, 3D visualization of longitudinal observations suggested that the reconstructed energy of I-131 uptake in the thyroid increased with acquisition time and there was a robust correlation between the reconstructed energy versus the gamma ray counts of I-131 (r2 = 0.8240). The ex vivo biodistribution experiment further confirmed the I-131 uptake in the thyroid for hybrid spectral CLT. Conclusions/Significance: Results indicated that hybrid spectral CLT could be potentially used for thyroid imaging to evaluate its function and monitor its treatment for thyroid cancer. © 2012 Hu et al.","","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Due to its hybrid nature, that is, optical excitation and ultrasonic detection, the method benefits from both the rich and versatile optical contrast and high (diffraction-limited) spatial resolution associated with the low scattering nature of ultrasonic wave propagation. By detecting tiny sound vibrations, resulting from selective absorption of light at multiple wavelengths, multispectral optoacoustic tomography can now 'hear color' in three dimensions, that is, deliver volumetric spectrally enriched (color) images from deep living tissues at high spatial resolution and in real time. These newfound imaging abilities directly relate to preclinical screening applications in animal models and are foreseen to significantly impact clinical decision making as well.

Absorption and scattering of the near infrared excitation light modulates the spectral prole of light as it propagates deep into biological tissue, meaning the images obtained provide only qualitative insight into the distribution of tissue chromophores. The goal of this work is to accurately recover the spectral prole of excitation light by modelling light uence in the data reconstruction, to enable quantitative imaging. We worked with a commercial small animal MSOT scanner and developed our light uence correction for its' cylindrical geometry. Optoacoustic image reconstruction pinpoints the sources of acoustic waves detected by the transducers and returns the initial pressure amplitude at these points. This pressure is the product of the dimensionless Grüneisen parameter, the absorption coefficient and the light uence. Under the condition of constant Grüneisen parameter and well modelled light uence, there is a linear relationship between the initial pressure amplitude measured in the optoacoustic image and the absorption coefficient. We were able to reproduce this linear relationship in diffierent physical regions of an agarose gel phantom containing targets of known optical absorption coefficient, demonstrating that our light uence model was working. We also demonstrate promising results of light uence correction eects on in vivo data.CCC. © 2015 SPIE-OSA.","OSA - The Optical Society","Conference paper","","Scopus"

A multispectral MRI-coupled fluorescence molecular tomography system was used to image the uptake kinetics of two fluorescent tracers injected simultaneously, one tracer targeted to the receptor of interest and the other tracer a nontargeted reference. These dynamic tracer data were then fit to a dual-tracer compartmental model to estimate the density of receptors available for binding in the tissue.

Tomographic acquisition with ultrasound linear arrays offers an easy implementation of single-side access, parallelized, and high-frequency detection, but usually comes with an image quality impaired by the directionality of the detectors. Indeed, a simple translation of the array perpendicular to its median imaging plane is often used, but results both in a poor resolution in the translation direction and strong limited-view artifacts. To improve the spatial resolution and the visibility of complex structures while retaining a planar detection geometry, we introduce, in this paper, a rotate-translate scanning scheme and investigate the performance of a scanner implemented at 15 MHz center frequency. The developed system achieved a quasi-isotropic uniform 3-D resolution of ∼170 μm over a cubic volume of side length 8.5 mm, i.e., an improvement in the resolution in the translation direction by almost one order of magnitude.

The Monte Carlo simulation-based multiple regression analysis for the absorbance spectra is then used to specify the absorption and scattering parameters of brain tissue. In this analysis, the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin and that of deoxygenated hemoglobin are estimated as the absorption parameters whereas the scattering amplitude a and the scattering power b in the expression of μs'=aλ-b as the scattering parameters, respectively.

A three-dimensional coordinates computing (TDCP) method including a preprocess algorithm is presented based on binocular stereo vision theory, to figure out the solution for diffusive nature of light in tissue and the emission spectra overlap of fluorescent labels. This algorithm is validated to be efficient to extract targets from multispectral images and determine the spot center of biological interests. Further data analysis indicates that this TDCP method could be used in three-dimensional positioning of the fluorescent target in small animals.

The pathologic α-helix → β-strand conversion of amyloid β1-42 and amyloid β1-40 peptides causes neuronal death in the vicinity. Symptomology often presents only after significant neurodegeneration. This thus warrants early detection of amyloidopathy in Alzheimers disease. Nonexistent modalities for direct identification and quantitation of soluble amyloid aggregates or (proto)fibrils forced us to undertake the development of a spectrophotometric technique to support ongoing drug design. Key requirements were independence from the need for extraneous staining, unambiguous amyloid aggregate detection, and minimal influence of interpretative errors. A Cytoviva instrument pivotal to this study captures scattering of light of visible-near-infrared (VNIR, 400-1000 nm) wavelengths within each pixel of the microscopic view field. We thus assembled a scattering intensity pattern database that provided ""signatures"" of amyloid aggregates. Comparison of unknown samples against this database enabled direct detection of amyloid aggregates. The technique was found useful for monitoring retinal and brain amyloidopathy in an ongoing preclinical anti-AD study, attesting to the techniques sensitivity and specificity. Interestingly, the technique was found applicable not just to excised brain tissue but also to isolated mouse retina. With the retina being heralded widely as a (diagnostic) extension of the CNS and retinal amyloidopathy occurring well before that in the brain, this development raises a possibility for the first direct retinal imaging diagnosis of early asymptomatic Alzheimers disease. © 2014 American Chemical Society.","American Chemical Society","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

Intraoperative hemodynamic imaging is needed to perform cerebrovascular reconstruction safely and effectively. Optical intrinsic signal (OIS) imaging is commonly used for assessing cerebral hemodynamics in experimental studies, because it can provide high-resolution mapping images. However, OIS is not used clinically due to algorithm, instrumentation and spectral resolution limitations. We tested the feasibility of a hyperspectral camera (HSC) for assessment of cortical hemodynamics with spectral imaging of the cerebral cortex in rats and in vivo humans.; Methods: A hyperspectral camera (HSC) was tested in a rat model of cerebral ischemia (middle cerebral artery occlusion) and during human revascularization surgery (STA–MCA anastomosis). Changes in cortical oxygen saturation were derived from spectral imaging data (400–800 nm) collected by exposing the cortex to Xenon light. Reflected light was sampled using the HSC. The system was then tested intraoperatively during superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery anastomosis procedures. Comparison with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging data was done.; Results: During middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats, the HSC technique showed a significant decrease in cortical oxygen saturation in the ischemic hemisphere. In clinical cases, the cortical oxygen saturation was increased after STA–MCA anastomosis, which agreed with the SPECT imaging data.; Conclusion: Continuous collection of imaging spectroscopic data is feasible and may provide reliable quantification of the hemodynamic responses in the brain. The HSC system may be useful for monitoring intraoperative changes in cortical surface hemodynamics during revascularization procedures in humans. © 2014, CARS.","Springer Verlag","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This review offers a concise summary of the most recently developed imaging techniques and discusses how they can be applied to vascular biology. In addition, we reflect upon the most important fluorescent reporters for vascular research that are currently available. Recent findings Recent advances in light sheet-based imaging techniques now offer the ability to live image the vascular system in whole organs or even in whole animals during development and in pathological conditions with a satisfactory spatial and temporal resolution. Conversely, super resolution microscopy now allows studying cellular processes at a near-molecular resolution. Summary Major recent improvements in a number of imaging techniques now allow study of vascular biology in ways that could not be considered previously. Researchers now have well-developed tools to specifically examine the dynamic nature of vascular development during angiogenic sprouting, remodeling and regression as well as the vascular responses in disease situations in vivo. In addition, open questions in endothelial and lymphatic cell biology that require subcellular resolution such as actin dynamics, junctional complex formation and stability, vascular permeability and receptor trafficking can now be approached with high resolution.

The results were compared to histopathology as gold standard. Results. The nodal volume could be scanned within 20 minutes. An unmixing procedure was proposed to identify melanoma metastases with multispectral photoacoustic imaging. Ultrasound overlay enabled anatomical correlation. The penetration depth of the photoacoustic signal was up to 2 cm. Conclusion. Multispectral three-dimensional photoacoustic imaging allowed for selective identification of melanoma metastases in human lymph nodes. © 2014 Gerrit Cornelis Langhout et al.","Hindawi Publishing Corporation","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This reduction in size allows for in vivo imaging to visualize pathology in hollow organs to guide biopsy, identify surgical margins, and localize disease. Recently, significant advances have been made in endomicroscopy technology, including in optical designs, light sources, optical fibers, and miniature scanners, allowing for improved resolution, greater tissue penetration, and multi-spectral imaging. Key performance goals that challenge our engineering capabilities include the need for large displacements, high scan speeds, linear motions, and mechanical stability in a scaled-down instrument package. Tiny scanning and actuation mechanisms must be reduced in size for in vivo imaging and performed with high speeds to ultimately achieve fast two- and three-dimensional beam scanning, representing a significant challenge for this field. Here, we present several representative miniature imaging technologies that are currently under development. We have included novel methods for cross-sectional imaging with deep tissue penetration, wide area surveillance, and high-resolution microscopy. These emerging technologies represent only a small fraction of the exciting new developments that promise to generate new knowledge about human biology and diseases in the near future. © 2014 Springer-Verlag London.

These abnormalities can be found surrounding the clinically visible actinic keratoses. Objectives The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of a hyperspectral imaging system in the detection of multiple clinical and subclinical AKs for early treatment of the affected areas. Materials and Methods Altogether 52 clinical AKs in 12 patients were included in this study. In six patients digital photos were taken of the naive AKs, and again after methylaminolevulinate(MAL)-fluorescence diagnosis which was used to teach HIS to find subclinical lesions. After 2-3 days when the MAL had vanished, the hyperspectral images were taken. Biopsies were taken from clinical AKs, healthy-looking skin and several suspected subclinical AKs. In the other six patients digital and hyperspectral images were taken of the naive AKs followed by one biopsy per patient. Results HIS detected all clinically visible 52 AKs and numerous subclinical lesions. The histopathology of the 33 biopsied lesions were concordant with the HIS results showing either AK (n = 28) or photodamage (n = 5). Of the 28 histopathologically confirmed AKs, 16 were subclinical. A specific diffuse reflectance spectrum of an AK and healthy skin was defined.

We describe the preparation, physicochemical characterization, in vivo bioimaging, and brain endothelial cell uptake of the theranostic liposomes. QDs and the drug were mainly located in the bilayer membrane and inner core of the liposomes, respectively. Spherical vesicles with a mean diameter of ~140 nm were formed. QDs were completely encapsulated by the vesicles. Nearly 80% encapsulation percentage was achieved for apomorphine. A greater fluorescence intensity was observed in mouse brains treated with liposomes compared to free QDs. This result was further confirmed by ex vivo imaging of the organs. QD uptake by the heart and liver was reduced by liposomal incorporation. Apomorphine accumulation in the brain increased by 2.4-fold after this incorporation. According to a hyperspectral imaging analysis, multifunctional liposomes but not the aqueous solution carried QDs into the brain. Liposomes were observed to have been efficiently endocytosed into bEND3 cells. The mechanisms involved in the cellular uptake were clathrin- and caveolamediated endocytosis, which were energy-dependent. To the best of our knowledge, our group is the first to develop liposomes with a QD-drug hybrid for the aim of imaging and treating brain disorders. © 2012 Wen et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.","","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Previously, we demonstrated that gold nanoshells rapidly enhance contrast of HER2 overexpression in ex vivo tissue sections. Our ultimate objective, however, is to discern HER2 overexpressing tissue from normal tissue in whole, nonsectioned, specimens to facilitate rapid diagnoses. Here, we use targeted nanoshells to quickly and effectively visualize HER2 receptor expression in intact ex vivo human breast tissue specimens. Punch biopsies of human breast tissue were analyzed after a brief 5-minute incubation with and without HER2-targeted silica-gold nanoshells using two-photon microscopy and stereomicroscopy. Labeling was subsequently verified using reflectance confocal microscopy, darkfield hyperspectral imaging, and immunohistochemistry to confirm levels of HER2 expression. Our results suggest that anti-HER2 nanoshells used in tandem with a near-infrared reflectance confocal microscope and a standard stereomicroscope may potentially be used to discern HER2-overexpressing cancerous tissue from normal tissue in near real time and offer a rapid supplement to current diagnostic techniques. © 2012 Lissett R.

To facilitate accurate determination of changes in the vascularity and oxygenation of a biological tissue over time, for example, a tumor in response to cancer therapy, an extensive study of stability and reproducibility of a small animal MSOT system has been performed. Investigations were first made with a stable phantom imaged repeatedly over time scales of hours, days and months, to evaluate the reproducibility of the system over time. We found that the small animal MSOT system exhibited excellent reproducibility with a coefficient of variation (COV) in the measured MSOT signals of less than 8% over the course of 30 days and within 1.5% over a single day. Experiments performed in vivo demonstrated the potential for measurement of oxyhemoglobin over time in a realistic experimental setting. The effect of breathing medical air or oxygen under conditions of fixed respiration rate and body temperature within normal organs, including the spleen and kidneys, were investigated. The COV for oxyhemoglobin signals retrieved from spectral unmixing was assessed within both biological (different mouse) and imaging (different scan) replicates. As expected, biological replicates produced a large COV (up to 40% within the spleen) compared to imaging replicates within a single mouse (up to 10% within the spleen). Furthermore, no significant difference was found between data acquired by different operators. The data presented here suggest that MSOT is highly reproducible for both phantom and in vivo imaging, hence could reliably detect changes in oxygenation occurring in living subjects. © 2015 SPIE.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

This is largely due to the inability to visualize hemodynamics in vivo longitudinally. Therefore, we have developed dynamic imaging methods to measure blood flow and hemoglobin oxygen saturation in implanted prevascularized tissues noninvasively and longitudinally. Using laser speckle imaging, multispectral imaging, and intravital microscopy, we demonstrate that fibrin-based tissue implants anastomose with the host (severe combined immunodeficient mice) in as short as 20h. Anastomosis results in initial perfusion with highly oxygenated blood, and an increase in average hemoglobin oxygenation of 53%. However, shear rates in the preformed vessels were low (20.8±12.8s-1), and flow did not persist in the vast majority of preformed vessels due to thrombus formation. These findings suggest that designing an appropriate vascular network structure in prevascularized tissues to maintain shear rates above the threshold for thrombosis may be necessary to maintain flow following implantation. We conclude that wide-field and microscopic functional imaging can dynamically assess blood flow and oxygenation in vivo in prevascularized tissues, and can be used to rapidly evaluate and improve prevascularization strategies. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Mary Ann Liebert Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Optoacoustic imaging combines highly attractive features, including rich contrast and high versatility in sensing diverse biological targets, excellent spatial resolution not compromised by light scattering, and relatively low cost of implementation. Yet, living objects present a complex target for optoacoustic imaging due to the presence of a highly heterogeneous tissue background in the form of strong spatial variations of scattering and absorption. Extracting quantified information on the actual distribution of tissue chromophores and other biomarkers constitutes therefore a challenging problem. Image quantification is further compromised by some frequently-used approximated inversion formulae. In this review, the currently available optoacoustic image reconstruction and quantification approaches are assessed, including back-projection and model-based inversion algorithms, sparse signal representation, wavelet-based approaches, methods for reduction of acoustic artifacts as well as multi-spectral methods for visualization of tissue bio-markers. Applicability of the different methodologies is further analyzed in the context of real-life performance in small animal and clinical in-vivo imaging scenarios. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","","Review","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In muscle tissue, ectopic deposition of specific lipids is further correlated with pathogenic development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Most intramyocellular lipids are organized into lipid droplets (LDs), which are metabolically active organelles. In order to better understand the putative role of LDs in pathogenesis, insight into both the location of LDs and nearby chemistry of muscle tissue is very useful. Here, we demonstrate the use of label-free coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy in combination with multivariate, chemometric analysis to visualize intracellular lipid accumulations in ex vivo muscle tissue. Consistent with our previous results, hyperspectral CARS microscopy showed an increase in LDs in tissues where LD proteins were overexpressed, and further chemometric analysis showed additional features morphologically (and chemically) similar to mitochondria that colocalized with LDs. CARS imaging is shown to be a very useful method for label-free stratification of ectopic fat deposition and cellular organelles in fresh tissue sections with virtually no sample preparation. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","Springer Verlag","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

TPEF can take advantage of the autofluorescence of molecules intrinsically contained in a biological tissue, as such NADH, elastin, collagen, and flavins. Two-photon microscopy has been already successfully used to image several types of tissues, including skin, muscles, tendons, bladder. Nevertheless, its usefulness in imaging colon tissue has not been deeply investigated yet. In this work we have used combined two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF), second harmonic generation microscopy (SHG), fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and multispectral two-photon emission detection (MTPE) to investigate different kinds of human ex-vivo fresh biopsies of colon. Morphological and spectroscopic analyses allowed to characterize both healthy mucosa, polyp, and colon samples in a good agreement with common routine histology. Even if further analysis, as well as a more significant statistics on a large number of samples would be helpful to discriminate between low, mild, and high grade cancer, our method is a promising tool to be used as diagnostic confirmation of histological results, as well as a diagnostic tool in a multiphoton endoscope or colonoscope to be used in in-vivo imaging applications. © 2012 SPIE.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Although vascular enhanced permeability and retention can aid targeting, high interstitial fluid pressure and dense extracellular matrix may hinder local penetration. Extravascular diffusivity depends upon nanoparticle size, surface modifications, and tissue vascularization. Gold nanoparticles functionalized with biologically-compatible layers may achieve improved uptake and distribution while enabling cytotoxicity through synergistic combination of chemotherapy and thermal ablation. Evaluation of nanoparticle uptake in vivo remains difficult, as detection methods are limited. We employ hyperspectral imaging of histology sections to analyze uptake and distribution of phosphatidylcholine-coated citrate gold nanoparticles (CGN) and silica-gold nanoshells (SGN) after tail-vein injection in mice bearing orthotopic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. For CGN, the liver and tumor showed 26.5±8.2 and 23.3±4.1 particles/100μm2 within 10μm from the nearest source and few nanoparticles beyond 50μm, respectively. The spleen had 35.5±9.3 particles/100μm2 within 10μm with penetration also limited to 50μm. For SGN, the liver showed 31.1±4.1 particles/100μm2 within 10μm of the nearest source with penetration hindered beyond 30μm. The spleen and tumor showed uptake of 22.1±6.2 and 15.8±6.1 particles/100μm2 within 10μm, respectively, with penetration similarly hindered.

The method is based on a quadratic constrained optimization (CO) algorithm that provides a closed-form solution under equality and inequality restrictions. In this paper, it is assumed that the time-resolved fluorescence spectrum profiles of the constituent components are linearly independent and known a priori. For comparison purposes, the standard least squares (LS) solution and two constrained versions nonnegativity constrained least squares (NCLS) and fully constrained least squares (FCLS) (Heinz and Chang, 2001) are also tested. Their performance was evaluated by using synthetic simulations, as well as imaged samples from fluorescent dyes and ex vivo tissue. In all the synthetic evaluations, the CO obtained the best accuracy in the estimations of the proportional contributions. CO could achieve an improvement ranging between 41% and 59% in the relative error compared to LS, NCLS, and FCLS at different signal-to-noise ratios. A liquid mixture of fluorescent dyes was also prepared and imaged in order to provide a controlled scenario with real data, where CO and FCLS obtained the best performance. The CO and FCLS were also tested with 20 ex vivo samples of human coronary arteries, where the expected concentrations are qualitatively known. A certainty measure was employed to assess the confidence in the estimations made by each algorithm. The experiments confirmed a better performance of CO, since this method is optimal with respect to equality and inequality restrictions in the linear unmixing formulation. Thus, the evaluation showed that CO achieves an accurate characterization of the samples. Furthermore, CO is a computational efficient alternative to estimate the abundance of components in m-FLIM data, since a global optimal solution is always guaranteed in a closed form. © 1964-2012 IEEE.","","Article","","Scopus"

The quickness with which the problem is brought to medical attention for diagnosis and treatment has great effects on the outcome of ischemic injury. Recently, hyperspectral sensors have advanced and emerged as compact imaging tools that can be utilized in medical diagnostics. Hyperspectral imaging provides a powerful tool for noninvasive tissue analyses. In this paper, the hyperspectral camera, with visible and invisible wavelengths, has been evaluated for detection and analysis of intestinal ischemia during surgeries. This technique can help the surgeon to quickly find ischemic tissues. Two cameras, a visible-to-near-infrared camera (4001000 nm) and an infrared camera (9001700 nm) were used to capture the hyperspectral images. Vessels supplying an intestinal segment of a pig were clamped to simulate ischemic conditions. A key wavelength range that provides the best differentiation between normal and ischemic intestine was determined from all wavelengths that potentially reduces the amount of data collected in subsequent work.

Instead we employ a herein introduced continuous data acquisition methodology that greatly shortens recording times over multiple projection angles and acquires high quality tomographic data without averaging. By this means a two dimensional image acquisition having 270 angular projections only takes about 9 seconds, while a full multispectral three dimensional image can normally take about 15 minutes to acquire with a single ultrasonic detector.

The CLI method is based on the detection of Cerenkov radiation (CR) generated by beta particles as they travel into the animal tissues with an energy such that Cerenkov emission condition is satisfied. This paper describes an image reconstruction method called multi spectral diffuse Cerenkov luminescence tomography (msCLT) in order to obtain 3D images from the detection of CR. The multispectral approach is based on a set of 2D planar images acquired using a number of narrow bandpass filters, and the distinctive information content at each wavelength is used in the 3D image reconstruction process. The proposed msCLT method was tested both in vitro and in vivo using 32P-ATP and all the images were acquired by using the IVIS 200 small animal optical imager (Caliper Life Sciences, Alameda USA). Source depth estimation and spatial resolution measurements were performed using a small capillary source placed between several slices of chicken breast. The theoretical Cerenkov emission spectrum and optical properties of chicken breast were used in the modelling of photon propagation. In vivo imaging was performed by injecting control nude mice with 10 MBq of 32P-ATP and the 3D tracer bio-distribution was reconstructed. Whole body MRI was acquired to provide an anatomical localization of the Cerenkov emission. The spatial resolution obtained from the msCLT reconstructed images of the capillary source showed that the FWHM is about 1.5 mm for a 6 mm depth. Co-registered MRI images showed that the Cerenkov emission regions matches fairly well with anatomical regions, such as the brain, heart and abdomen. Ex vivo imaging of the different organs such as intestine, brain, heart and ribs further confirms these findings. We conclude that in vivo 3D bio-distribution of a pure beta-minus emitting radiopharmaceutical such as 32P-ATP can be obtained using the msCLT reconstruction approach. © 2011 Optical Society of America.","Optical Society of American (OSA)","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Morphological and spectroscopic differences were found between healthy and pathological skin samples, including tumors. In particular, we examined tissue samples from normal and pathological scar tissue (keloid), and skin tumors, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and malignant melanoma (MM). By using combined TPE-SHG microscopy we investigated morphological features of different skin regions, as BCC, tumor stroma, healthy dermis, fibroblastic proliferation, and keloids. A score, based on the SHG to autofluorescence aging index of dermis (SAAID), was assigned to characterize each region. We found that both BCC and surrounding dermis have a negative SAAID value, tumor stroma has a positive SAAID value, whereas fibroblastic proliferation and keloids have a SAAID value close to the unit. Further comparative analysis of healthy skin and neoplastic samples was performed using FLIM, SLIM, and MTPE. In particular, BCC showed a blue-shifted fluorescence emission, a higher fluorescence response at 800 nm excitation wavelength and a slightly longer mean fluorescence lifetime. MM showed an emission spectrum similar to the corresponding healthy skin emission spectrum, and a mean fluorescence lifetime distribution shifted towards shorter values. Finally, the use of aminolevulinic acid as a contrast agent has been demonstrated to increase the constrast in BCC border detection.

We evaluated multispectral fluorescence imaging (MSFI) to quantify extracellular pH (pH e) in dye-perfused, surgically-resected tumor specimens with commercially available instrumentation. Utilizing a water-soluble organic dye with pH-dependent fluorescence emission (SNARF-4F), we used standard fluorimetry to quantitatively assess the emission properties of the dye as a function of pH. By conducting these studies within the spectroscopic constraints imposed by the appropriate imaging filter set supplied with the imaging system, we determined that correction of the fluorescence emission of deprotonated dye was necessary for accurate determination of pH due to suboptimal excitation. Subsequently, employing a fluorimetry-derived correction factor (CF), MSFI data sets of aqueous dye solutions and tissuelike phantoms could be spectrally unmixed to accurately quantify equilibrium concentrations of protonated (HA) and deprotonated (A-) dye and thus determine solution pH. Finally, we explored the feasibility of MSFI for high-resolution pH e mapping of human colorectal cancer cell-line xenografts. Data presented suggest that MSFI is suitable for quantitative determination of pHe in ex vivo dye-perfused tissue, potentially enabling measurement of pH across a variety of preclinical models of disease. © 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

However, due to difficulties with in vivo cell marking and monitoring, most studies have been restricted to fixed tissue or cells in culture. Here, we report the delivery of multiple (up to four), multicolor fluorescent protein (FP) constructs and four-dimensional (4-D), multispectral time-lapse confocal imaging of cell movements in living chick embryos. Cell cytoskeletal components are fluorescently tagged after microinjection and electroporation of a cocktail of FP constructs into specific regions of chick embryos. We tested 11 different FP constructs in various two-, three-, and four-color combinations using multispectral imaging and linear unmixing to limit the crosstalk between different emission spectra. We monitored intracellular dynamics in individual multicolored migrating cells in vivo and developed a set of advantageous imaging parameters for 4-D time-lapse confocal microscopy. We find that the number of four-color labeled cells in a typical embryo is approximately 10% of the total number of fluorescently labeled cells; this value consistently increases showing that approximately 50% of the total labeled cells have only one-color. We find that multicolored cells are photostable for time-lapses of approximately 2-3 h. Thus, cell labeling with up to four FP color schemes combined with multispectral, 4-D confocal time-lapse imaging offers a powerful tool to simultaneously analyze cellular and molecular dynamics during chick embryogenesis.","","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

The underlying mechanisms that regulate such interactions remain largely unknown. NG2 is a transmembrane proteoglycan whose presence on transformed cells has been demonstrated to increase proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. To study the effects of NG2 during tumour growth and progression, we engineered an NG2 positive human glioma cell line (U251-NG2) from parental NG2 negative cells (U251-WT) and implanted both cell types stereotactically into immunodeficient nude rat brains. The tumours were longitudinally monitored in vivo using multispectral MRI employing two differently sized contrast agents (Gd-DTPA-BMA and Gadomer) to assess vascular leakiness, vasogenic oedema, tumour volumes and necrosis. Comparisons of Gd-DTPA-BMA and Gadomer revealed differences in their spatial distribution in the U251-NG2 and U251-WT tumours. The U251-NG2 tumours exhibited a higher leakiness of the larger molecular weight Gadomer and displayed a stronger vasogenic oedema (69.9 ± 15.2, P = 0.018, compared to the controls (10.7 ± 7.7). Moreover, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy revealed that the U251-NG2 tumours had a higher microvascular density (11.81 ± 0.54; P = 0.0010) compared to controls (5.76 ± 0.87), with vessels that displayed larger gaps between the endothelial cells. Thus, tumour cells can regulate both the function and structure of the host-derived tumour vasculature through NG2 expression, suggesting a role for NG2 in the cross-talk between tumour-host compartments. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

With the recent emergence of methods appropriate for bio-marker in vivo staining, such as bioluminescence, fluorescent molecular probes and proteins, as well as nanoparticle-based targeted agents, significant attention has been shifted toward in vivo interrogations of different dynamic biological processes at the molecular level. This progress has been largely supported by the development of advanced tomographic imaging technologies suitable for obtaining volumetric visualization of bio-marker distributions in small animals at a whole-body or whole-organ scale, an imaging frontier that is not accessible by the existing tissue-sectioning microscopic techniques due to intensive light scattering beyond the depth of a few hundred microns. Major examples of such recently developed optical imaging modalities are reviewed here, including bioluminescence tomography (BLT), fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT), and optical projection tomography (OPT). The pharmaceutical imaging community has quickly appropriated itself of these novel forms of optical imaging, since they come with very compelling advantages, such as quantitative three-dimensional capabilities, direct correlation to the biological cultures, easiness and cost-effectiveness of use, and the use of safe non-ionizing radiation. Some multi-modality approaches, combining light with other imaging modalities such as X-Ray CT or MRI, giving the ability to acquire both an optical contrast reconstruction along with a hi-fidelity anatomical images, are also reviewed. A separate section is devoted to the hybrid imaging techniques based on the optoacoustic phenomenon, such as multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), which are poised to leverage the traditional contrast and specificity advantages of optical spectrum by delivering an ever powerful set of capabilities, including real-time operation and high spatial resolution, not affected by the scattering nature of biological tissues. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.","","Article","","Scopus"

Surgical excision of cancer often is confronted with difficulties in the identification of cancer spread and the accurate delineation of tumor margins. Currently, the assessment of tumor borders is afforded by postoperative pathology or, less reliably, intraoperative frozen sectioning. Fluorescence imaging is a natural modality for intraoperative use by directly relating to the surgeon's vision and offers highly attractive characteristics, such as high-resolution, sensitivity, and portability. Via the use of targeted probes it also becomes highly tumor-specific and can lead to significant improvements in surgical procedures and outcome. Methods: Mice bearing xenograft human tumors were injected with αvβ3-integrin receptor-targeted fluorescent probe and in vivo visualized by using a novel, real-time, multispectral fluorescence imaging system. Confirmatory ex vivo imaging, bioluminescence imaging, and histopathology were used to validate the in vivo findings. Results: Fluorescence images were all in good correspondence with the confirming bioluminescence images in respect to signal colocalization. Fluorescence imaging detected all tumors and successfully guided total tumor excision by effectively detecting small tumor residuals, which occasionally were missed by the surgeon. Tumor tissue exhibited target-to-background ratio of ∼4.0, which was significantly higher compared with white-light images representing the visual contrast. Histopathology confirmed the capability of the method to identify tumor negative margins with high specificity and better prediction rate compared with visual inspection. Conclusions: Real-time multispectral fluorescence imaging using tumor specific molecular probes is a promising modality for tumor excision by offering real time feedback to the surgeon in the operating room. © Society of Surgical Oncology 2011.","Springer New York LLC","Article","","Scopus"

Spectral illumination of tissue is accomplished utilizing a DLP® based spectral illuminator incorporating a series of bandpass spectra and measuring the reflectance image with a CCD array detector. Wavelength dependent images are post processed with a multivariate least squares analysis method using known reference spectra of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin. Alternatively, illuminating with complex reference spectra reduces the number of spectral images required for generating chemically relevant images color encoded for relative percentage of oxyhemoglobin are collected and displayed in real time near-video rate, (3 to 4) frames per second (fps). As a proof of principle application, a kidney of an anesthetized pig was imaged before and after renal vasculature occlusion showing the clamped kidney to be 61% of the undamped kidney percentage of oxyhemoglobin.

The hyperspectral imaging data cube of cucumber (Cucumis sativus) leaves in the range of 450-850nm was investigated and preprocessed. Sixty optical signatures or indices as a function of the associated reflectance (R λ) at the special wavelength (λ) nm which proposed in the literatures were used to predict the total chlorophyll content in cucumber leaves. Finally, R 710/R 760, (R 780-R 710)/(R 780-R 680), (R 750-R 705)/(R 750+R 705), (R 680-R 430)/(R 680+R 430), R 860/(R 550×R 708), (R 695-705) -1-(R 750-800) -1, and REP-LEM (a index based on red edge position and estimated with a linear extrapolation method) were identified as optimum indices. Red-edge waveband (680-780nm) appeared in all these optimum indices, indicating the importance of REP (red edge position) in chlorophyll estimation. When (R 695-705) -1-(R 750-800) -1, the best index was applied to an independent validation set, chlorophyll content (r=0.8286) were reasonably well predicted, indicating model robustness. Depending on the sample, this technique enables to identify and characterize the relative content of various chlorophyll that distribution in the cucumber leaves. The map shows a relatively low level of chlorophyll at margins. Higher level can be noticed in the regions along the main veins and in some areas exhibiting dark green tissue.

The goal of this work was to develop in vivo lymph tests using the principles of flow cytometry. Cells in living animals were counted by laser (420-2,300 nm) generation of photoacoustic (PA) signals in individual cells hydrodynamically focused by lymph valves into a single file flow, and using endogenous absorption as intrinsic cell-specific markers, or gold nanorods, nanoshells, and carbon nanotubes as multicolor probes. PA data were verified by high-speed transmission, photothermal, and fluorescent imaging. Counting of melanoma and immune-related cells in normal, apoptotic, and necrotic states in lymphatics in vivo was demonstrated to have the unprecedented sensitivity as one metastatic cell among millions of white blood cells. The time-resolved PA spectral identification of flowing cells was achieved using multicolor labels and laser pulses of different wavelengths and time delays. Multiparameter, noninvasive, portable flow cytometer can be used for preclinical studies on animals with the potential of translation to humans for in vivo PA mapping of colorless lymph vessels and sentinel nodes with simultaneous single cell detection and metastasis assessment without labeling or use of contrast dyes and/or novel low-toxic multicolor probes with different absorption spectra. © 2008 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.","","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

A total of 25 patients were measured using a compact steady-state diffuse reflectance/fluorescence spectrometer and a fibre-optic-coupled multispectral time-resolved spectrofluorometer. Measurements were performed in vivo prior to surgical excision of the investigated region. Singular value decomposition was used to reduce the dimensionality of steady state diffuse reflectance and fluorescence spectra. Linear discriminant analysis was then applied to the measurements of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and used to predict the tissue disease state with a leave-one-out methodology. This approach was able to correctly diagnose 87% of the BCCs. With 445 nm excitation a decrease in the spectrally averaged fluorescence lifetime was observed between normal tissue and BCC lesions with a mean value of 886 ps. Furthermore, the fluorescence lifetime for BCCs was lower than that of the surrounding healthy tissue in all cases and statistical analysis of the data revealed that this decrease was significant (p = 0.002). © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The system's novelty resides in its method of illuminating tissue with precisely predetermined continuous complex spectra. The Texas Instruments digital micromirror device, DMD, chip consisting of 768 by 1024 mirrors, each 16 μm square, can be switched between two positions at 12.5 kHz. Switching the appropriate mirrors controls the intensity of light illuminating the tissue as a function of wavelength, active spectral illumination. Meaning, the tissue can be illuminated with a different spectrum of light within 80 μs. Precisely, predetermined spectral illumination penetrates into patient tissue, its chemical composition augments the spectral properties of the light, and its reflected spectra are detected and digitized at each pixel detector of a silicon charge-coupled device, CCD. Using complex spectral illumination, digital signal processing and chemometric methods produce chemically relevant images at near video rates. Specific to this work, tissue is illuminated spectrally with light spanning the visible electromagnetic spectrum (380 to 780 nm). Spectrophotometric images are detected and processed visualizing the percentage of oxyhemoglobin at each pixel detector and presented continuously, in real time, at 3 images per second. As a proof of principle application, kidneys of four live anesthetized pigs were imaged before, during, and after renal vascular occlusion. DLP Hyperspectral Imaging with active spectral illumination detected a 64.73 ± 1.5% drop in the oxygenation of hemoglobin within 30 s of renal arterial occlusion. Producing chemically encoded images at near video rate, time-resolved hyperspectral imaging facilitates monitoring renal blood flow during animal surgery and holds considerable promise for doing the same during human surgical interventions.","","Article","","Scopus"

Based on spatial light modulation, the method is inexpensive, non-contact, and allows spatial mapping of tissue absorption and reduced scattering coefficients at any wavelength between 450 and 1,100 nm. Currently, clinicians rely on qualitative visual inspection to guide parameter selection for laser-based tattoo removal. MI provides quantitative measurements of multi-colored tattooed skin which may help guide treatment and objectively assess response. Study Design/Materials and Methods: We have measured the spatially varying optical properties of multicolored tattooed skin over a 50mm x 50mm field of view at wavelengths ranging from 650 to 970nm using MI. These measurements were compared to a similar field of view of non-tattooed skin from an adjacent area. Results: We have determined the differentiated optical properties in vivo of multi-colored tattooed skin versus non-tattooed skin. Conclusions: MI provides spatially resolved quantitative information with potential for quantitative assessment of response to treatment and may provide guidance for laser tattoo removal in the future. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Using acridine orange (1 milliMolar, 20 seconds) to stain nuclei, basal cell carcinomas were detected in fluorescence confocal mosaics of Mohs surgical excisions with sensitivity of 96.6% and specificity of 89.2%. A possible barrier toward clinical acceptance is that confocal mosaics are based on a single mode of contrast and appear in grayscale, whereas histology is based on two (hematoxylin for nuclei, eosin for cellular cytoplasm and dermis) and appears purple-and-pink. Toward addressing this barrier, we report progress in developing a multispectral analytical model for digital staining: fluorescence confocal mosaics, which show only nuclei, are digitally stained purple and overlaid on reflectance confocal mosaics, which show only cellular cytoplasm and dermis, and digitally stained pink, to mimic the appearance of histology. Comparison of digitally stained confocal mosaics by our Mohs surgeon to the corresponding Mohs histology shows good correlation for normal and tumor detail. Digitally stained confocal mosaicing microscopy may allow direct examination of freshly excised tissue and serve as an adjunct for rapid pathology at-the-bedside. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Three highspeed, spectrometer-based frequency-domain OCT systems operating at 800 nm (20,000 A-scans/s), 1060 nm, and 1300 nm (both 47,000 A-scans/s) at comparable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), SNR roll-off with scanning depth, and transverse resolution (<15 μm) were used to acquire 3-D tomograms of glabrous and hairy human skin in vivo. Images obtained using these three systems were compared in terms of penetration depth, resolution, and contrast. Normal as well as abnormal sites like moles and scar tissue were examined. In this preliminary study, skin pigmentation had little effect on penetration accomplished at three different wavelengths. The epidermis and dermal-epidermal junction could be properly delineated using OCT at 800 nm, and this wavelength offered better contrast over the other two wavelength regions. OCT at 1300 nm permits imaging of deeper dermal layers, critical for detecting deeper tumor boundaries and other deeper skin pathologies.

The imaging is performed on three live nude mice in which tritium-powered light sources are surgically implanted. High-resolution magnetic resonance images and multispectral, multiview bioluminescence images are acquired in the same session. An anatomical model is constructed by segmenting the magnetic resonance images for all major tissues. The model is subsequently registered with nonlinear transformations to the 3-D light exittance (exiting intensity) surface map generated from the luminescence images. A Monte Carlo algorithm, along with a set of tissue optical properties obtained from in vivo measurements, is used to solve the forward problem. The measured and simulated light exittance images are found to differ by a factor of up to 2. The greatest cause of this moderate discrepancy is traced to the small errors in source positioning, and to a lesser extent to the optical properties used for the tissues.

However, BLT is severely ill-posed because of complex photon propagation in the biological tissue and limited boundary measured data with noise. Therefore, sufficient a priori knowledge should be fused for the uniqueness and stability of BLT solution. Permissible source region strategy and spectrally resolved measurements are two kinds of a priori knowledge commonly used in BLT reconstruction. This paper compares their performance with simulation and in vivo heterogeneous mouse experiments. In order to improve the efficiency of large-scale source restoration, this paper introduces an efficient iterative shrinkage thresholding method that not only has faster convergence rate but also has better reconstruction accuracy than the modified Newton-type optimization approach.

In particular, nano-scaled carriers have revolutionalized drug delivery, allowing for therapeutic agents to be selectively targeted on an organ, tissue and cell specific level, also minimizing exposure of healthy tissue to drugs. In this review we discuss and analyze three issues, which are considered to be at the core of nano-scaled drug delivery systems, namely functionalization of nanocarriers, delivery to target organs and in vivo imaging. The latest developments on highly specific conjugation strategies that are used to attach biomolecules to the surface of nanoparticles (NP) are first reviewed. Besides drug carrying capabilities, the functionalization of nanocarriers also facilitate their transport to primary target organs. We highlight the leading advantage of nanocarriers, i.e. their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a tightly packed layer of endothelial cells surrounding the brain that prevents high-molecular weight molecules from entering the brain. The BBB has several transport molecules such as growth factors, insulin and transferrin that can potentially increase the efficiency and kinetics of brain-targeting nanocarriers. Potential treatments for common neurological disorders, such as stroke, tumours and Alzheimer's, are therefore a much sought-after application of nanomedicine. Likewise any other drug delivery system, a number of parameters need to be registered once functionalized NPs are administered, for instance their efficiency in organ-selective targeting, bioaccumulation and excretion. Finally, direct in vivo imaging of nanomaterials is an exciting recent field that can provide real-time tracking of those nanocarriers. We review a range of systems suitable for in vivo imaging and monitoring of drug delivery, with an emphasis on most recently introduced molecular imaging modalities based on optical and hybrid contrast, such as fluorescent protein tomography and multispectral optoacoustic tomography. Overall, great potential is foreseen for nanocarriers in medical diagnostics, therapeutics and molecular targeting.

The scope of this research is threefold: a) provide non-invasive, non-ionizing functional imaging comprising combined blood flow and neural dynamics information, as well as passive measurement of temperature and conductivity fluctuations during activation of specified brain areas in-vivo and b) identify new brain biomarkers related to brain functionality both in health and disease through Terahertz biomolecule imaging ex-vivo. To achieve the abovementioned the stages of our research comprise: 1) exploration of the functional imaging potential of a novel passive microwave imaging device, 2) development of integrated functional imaging systems for concurrent measurements of blood flow, neural activity, temperature and conductivity changes in the brain, 3) definition of biomolecular markers related to brain functionality and disease ex-vivo. The accumulation of a wealth of brain functional data from molecular to system level will lead to a broad range of applications, spanning the delineation of brain networks, improved post-processing of the obtained measurements, understanding the basis of neuropsychiatric diseases and effective treatment design. ©2009 IEEE.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Skin contains fluorophores including elastin, keratin, collagen, FAD and NADH. This endogenous contrast allows tissue to be imaged without the addition of exogenous agents and allows the in vivo state of cells and tissues to be studied. A modified DermaInspect® multiphoton tomography system was used to excite autofluorescence at 760 nm in vivo and on freshly excised ex vivo tissue. This instrument simultaneously acquires fluorescence lifetime images in four spectral channels between 360-655 nm using time-correlated single photon counting and can also provide hyperspectral images. The multispectral fluorescence lifetime images were spatially segmented and binned to determine lifetimes for each cell by fitting to a double exponential lifetime model.

Fully understanding the pathophysiology of electrical trauma is still a challenge for clinicians and scientists. Further elucidating the natural history of this form of tissue injury could be helpful in improving limb salvage and offering stage-appropriate therapy. Multi-spectral imaging technique is a non-invasive technology that can be used to determine optical properties of tissues in and adjacent to injury. Images at different wavelengths can provide essential information related to the pathophysiological condition of the tissue. To promote the applicability of this technique in medical diagnosis, we built a complete experimental model of electrical injury. In this model, electrical injuries were created by a reliable high-tension shock system at preset voltage or current. A thermal camera recorded the change of skin temperature during the electrical shock. Then, a high-resolution spectral imaging system based on structured illumination was used to capture images for post analysis to extrapolate optical properties of the tissue. To test accuracy, this imaging system was calibrated by using a set of epoxy phantoms with known optical properties. In this paper, the results of experiments conducted on rats and discussions on the systemic changes in tissue optical properties before and after electrical shock are presented. © 2011 SPIE.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

The most reliable method for localizing infection requires radiolabeling autologous white blood cells ex vivo. A compound that can be injected directly into a patient and can selectively image infectious foci will eliminate the drawbacks. The resolution of infection is associated with neutrophil apoptosis and necrosis presenting phosphatidylserine (PS) on the neutrophil outer leaflet. Targeting PS with intravenous administration of a PS-specific, near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore will permit localization of infectious foci by optical imaging. Methods: Bacterial infection and sterile inflammation were induced in separate groups (n=5) of mice. PS was targeted with a NIR fluorophore, PSVue®794 (2.7 pmol). Imaging was performed (ex=730 nm, em=830 nm) using Kodak Multispectral FX-Pro system. The contralateral normal thigh served as an individualized control. Confocal microscopy of normal and apoptotic neutrophils and bacteria confirmed PS specificity. Results: Lesions, with a 10-s image acquisition, were unequivocally visible at 5 min post-injection. At 3 h post-injection, the lesion to background intensity ratios in the foci of infection (6.6±0.2) were greater than those in inflammation (3.2±0.5). Image fusions confirmed anatomical locations of the lesions. Confocal microscopy determined the fluorophore specificity for PS. Conclusions: Targeting PS presented on the outer leaflet of apoptotic or necrotic neutrophils as well as gram-positive microorganism with PS-specific NIR fluorophore provides a sensitive means of imaging infection. Literature indicates that NIR fluorophores can be detected 7-14 cm deep in tissue. This observation together with the excellent results and the continued development of versatile imaging devices could make optical imaging a simple, specific, and rapid modality for imaging infection. © Academy of Molecular Imaging and Society for Molecular Imaging, 2011.","","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Moreover, the processes underlying the in vivo remodeling of these grafts and the fate of cells seeded onto scaffolds remain unclear. Here we addressed these unmet scientific needs by using intravital molecular imaging to monitor the development of tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVG) implanted in mouse carotid artery. Methods and Results: Green fluorescent protein-labeled human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and cord blood-derived endothelial progenitor cells were seeded on polyglycolic acid-poly-L-lactic acid scaffolds to construct small-caliber TEVG that were subsequently implanted in the carotid artery position of nude mice (n=9). Mice were injected with near-infrared agents and imaged using intravital fluorescence microscope at 0, 7, and 35 days to validate in vivo the TEVG remodeling capability (Prosense680; VisEn, Woburn, MA) and patency (Angiosense750; VisEn). Imaging coregistered strong proteolytic activity and blood flow through anastomoses at both 7 and 35 days postimplantation. In addition, image analyses showed green fluorescent protein signal produced from mesenchymal stem cell up to 35 days postimplantation. Comprehensive correlative histopathological analyses corroborated intravital imaging findings. Conclusions: Multispectral imaging offers simultaneous characterization of in vivo remodeling enzyme activity, functionality, and cell fate of viable small-caliber TEVG. © 2010 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Mary Ann Liebert Inc.","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In particular, we examined tissue samples from normal and pathological scar tissue (keloid), and skin tumors, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and malignant melanoma (MM). By using combined TPE-SHG microscopy we investigated morphological features of different skin regions, as BCC, tumor-stroma interface, healthy dermis, fibroblastic proliferation, and keloids. The SHG to autofluorescence aging index of dermis (SAAID) score was used to characterize each region, finding differences between BCC, healthy skin, tumor-stroma interface, keloids, and fibroblastic proliferation. Further comparative analysis of healthy skin and neoplastic samples was performed using FLIM. In particular, BCC showed a blue-shifted fluorescence emission, a higher absorption at 800 nm excitation wavelength, and a slightly longer mean fluorescence lifetime. MM showed a lifetime distribution similar to the corresponding melanocytic nevus (MN) lifetime distribution for the slow lifetime component, and different for the fast lifetime component. © 2008 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

CLI is based on the detection of optical Cerenkov radiation generated by beta particles as they travel into the animal tissues with energy greater than Cerenkov threshold. The main goal of this work is the development of a novel optical image reconstruction method called multi spectral Cerenkov luminescence tomography (msCLT). The starting point of the msCLT reconstruction scheme is a set of 2D planar images acquired using several narrow bandpass filters. Because of the different tissues absorption at different wavelengths this provide distinctive information content that can be used for image reconstruction. More precisely the msCLT algorithm is based on a regularized iterative non-negative scheme in order to find the unknown source intensity solution, the theoretical Cerenkov emission spectrum was also included in the algorithm. In order to investigate the performances of the msCLT approach in vitro and in vivo imaging using 32P-ATP were performed by using the IVIS 200 (Caliper, a PerkinElmer company). A set of spatial resolution measurements were performed using a small capillary source placed between several slices of chicken breast at different depths. The spatial resolution obtained from the msCLT reconstructed images of the capillary showed that the FWHM is 1.5 mm for a source placed at 6 mm depth. In order to investigate the in vivo performances of the msCLT reconstruction method, a control nude mice injected with 10 MBq of 32P-ATP were imaged. Whole body MRI was acquired to provide an anatomical localization of the Cerenkov emission. msCLT reconstructed images co-registered with MRI images showed that the Cerenkov emission regions matches well with anatomical regions, such as the brain, heart and abdomen. These results were also confirmed by ex vivo imaging of organs such as intestine, brain, heart and ribs. © 2011 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Conference paper","","Scopus"

PIR-fiber cables and probes could be coupled with a variety of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and Tunable Diode Lasers (TDL), including pig tailing of Mercury Cadmium Tellurium (MCT) detectors. Using these techniques no sample preparation is necessary for PIR-fiber probes to measure reflection and absorption spectra, in situ, in vivo, in real time and even multiplexed. Such PIR-fiber probes have been used for evanescent absorption spectroscopy of malignant tissue and skin surface diagnostics in-vivo, glucose detection in blood as well as crude oil composition analysis, for organic pollution and nuclear waste monitoring. A review of various PIR-fiber applications in medicine, industry and environment control is presented. The synergy of PIR-fibers flexibility with a super high spectral resolution of TDL spectrometers with Δv=10-4cm-1, provides the unique tool for gas analysis, specifically when PIR-fibers are coupled as pigtails with MCT-detectors and Pb-salt lasers. Design of multichannel PIR-fiber tailed TDL spectrometer could be used as a portable device for multispectral gas analysis at 1ppb level of detectivity for various applications in medicine and biotechnology.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Most hyperspectral or multispectral imaging systems use wavelength selection devices such as acousto-optic tunable filters (AOTFs), tunable grating or prism-based monochromators, or filter wheels. While these devices can select wavelengths they cannot create arbitrary spectral profiles. This simple and economical system can be controlled at high speed (up to 5000 illumination profiles per second). Digitally controlled illumination is bit additive with image data providing high dynamic range imaging with monochrome or color imaging devices. This is especially advantageous for endoscopes employing small well CCD or CMOS sensors since the dynamic range now can extend beyond the limits of the sensor itself. In this report we show multispectral images of in vivo tissue and in vitro tissue samples using endoscopes, surgical microscopes and conventional microscopes.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Microscopic images of the dermis are acquired, generating a series of spectroscopic images formatted as a function of wavelength consisting of one spectral and two spatial dimensions; a hyperspectral image data cube. The data thus collected can be considered as a series of spatially resolved spectra. For data collection, images are acquired by a system consisting of a near infrared liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF) and a Focal plane array detector (FPA) integrated with a microscope. The LCTF is continuously tunable over a useful near infrared spectral range (650-950 nm) with an average full width at half-height bandwidth of 6.78 nm. To provide high quantum efficiency without etaloning we utilized a back-illumination FPA with deep -depletion technology. A 30W halogen light source illuminates a dermal tissue area of approximately 18 mm in diameter. Reflected light from the dermal tissue is first passed through the microscope, the LCTF, and then imaged onto the FPA. The acquired hyperspectral data is deconvoluted using a multivariate least squares approach that requires at least two reference spectra, oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin. The resulting images are gray scale encoded to directly represent the varying spatial distributions of oxyhemoglobin contribution. As a proof of principle example, we examined a clinical model of vascular occlusion and reperfusion.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Such phantoms are necessary in clinical imaging, insuring the accuracy and calibration of acquired images and allowing for artifact correction. In addition, phantoms allow image comparison and/or registration between multiple instruments at different clinics and temporal comparison of the same animal. Recently, optical tissue phantoms have received much attention as it has become apparent that optical imagers pose many of the same requirements for quality control and calibration as clinical imagers. Small animal fluorescence imaging is a rapidly growing field that could benefit greatly from the implementation of a standardized reference phantom. We present our results in developing optical tissue phantoms for quality control and calibration of small animal fluorescence imagers. To accurately simulate in vivo imaging conditions, the phantom provides absorption, scatter, and fluorescence information, in known amounts and varying with spatial distribution. This allows us to monitor day-to-day variability and system response as a function of different optical path components in hyperspectral imaging technologies for small animal fluorescence imaging. The phantom has also enabled us to assess the actual, or practical, sensitivity of a small animal fluorescence imager in terms of imaging a dye concentration through an equivalent tissue depth. By combining an understanding of system response with theoretical optical raytrace modeling, this calibration tool can be applied to the majority of small animal fluorescence imagers currently in production.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

However, because of complex photon transportation in biological tissue and boundary detection data with high noise, bioluminescent sources in deeper positions generally cannot be localized. In our previous work, we used achromatic or monochromatic measurements and an a priori permissible source region strategy to develop a multilevel adaptive finite-element algorithm. In this paper, we propose a spectrally solved tomographic algorithm with a posteriori permissible source region selection. Multispectral measurements, and anatomical and optical information first deal with the nonuniqueness of BLT and constrain the possible solution of source reconstruction. The use of adaptive mesh refinement and permissible source region based on a posteriori measures not only avoids the dimension disaster arising from the multispectral measured data but also reduces the ill-posedness of BLT and therefore improves the reconstruction quality. Reconsideration of the optimization method and related modifications further enhance reconstruction robustness and efficiency. We also incorporate into the method some improvements for reducing computational burdens. Finally, using a whole-body virtual mouse phantom, we demonstrate the capability of the proposed BLT algorithm to reconstruct accurately bioluminescent sources in deeper positions. In terms of optical property errors and two sources of discernment in deeper positions, this BLT algorithm represents the unique predominance for BLT reconstruction. © 2007 IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Article","","Scopus"

Generally, to recover the bioluminescent sources, the source reconstruction problem is formulated as a nonlinear least-squares-type bounds constrained optimization problem. However, bioluminescence tomography (BLT) is an ill-posed problem. For the sake of stability and uniqueness of BLT, many algorithms have been proposed to regularize the problem, such as L2 norm and L1 norm. Here, we proposed a new regularization method with Huber function to regularize BLT problem to obtain robustness like L1 and rapid convergence of L 2. Furthermore, the computational burden is largely increased with the use of spectral data. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop a fast reconstruction algorithm for solving multispectral bioluminescence tomography. In the paper, a limited memory quasi-Newton algorithm for solving the large-scale optimization problem is proposed to fast localize the bioluminescent source. In the numerical simulation, a heterogeneous phantom was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm with the Monte Carlo based synthetic data. Additionally, the real mouse experiments were conducted to further evaluate the proposed algorithm. The results demonstrate the potential and merits of the proposed algorithm. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

While erythema is the result of capillary dilation and subsequent local increase of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentration, edema is characterized by an increase in extracellular fluid in the dermis leading to local tissue swelling. Edema and erythema are typically graded visually. In this work we tested the potential of spectral imaging as a non-invasive method for quantitative documentation of both the erythema and the edema reactions. As examples of dermatological conditions that exhibit skin inflammation we imaged patients suffering from acne, herpes zoster, and poison ivy rashes using a hyperspectral-imaging camera. Spectral images were acquired in the visible and near infrared part of the spectrum, where oxy-Hb and water demonstrate absorption bands. The values of apparent concentrations of oxy-Hb and water were calculated based on an algorithm that takes into account spectral contributions of deoxy-hemoglobin, melanin, and scattering. In each case examined concentration maps of oxy-Hb and water can be constructed that represent quantitative visualizations of the intensity and extent of erythema and edema correspondingly. In summary, we demonstrate that spectral imaging can be used in dermatology to quantitatively document parameters relating to skin inflammation. Applications may include monitoring of disease progression as well as efficacy of treatments.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Sensitivity is limited, especially in the visible spectral range, by the presence of ubiquitous autofluorescence signals (mostly arising from the skin and gut), which need to be separated from those of targeted fluorophores. Fluorescence-based imaging is also affected by absorbing and scattering properties of tissue in both the visible and to a lesser extent the near-infrared (NIR) regions. However, the small size of typical animal models (usually mice) often permits the detection of enough light arising even from relatively deep locations to allow the capture of signals with an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio. Multispectral imaging, through its ability to separate autofluorescence from label fluorescence, can increase sensitivity as much as 300 times compared to conventional approaches, and concomitantly improve quantitative accuracy. In the NIR region, autofluorescence, while still significant, poses less of a problem. However, the task of disentangling signals from multiple fluorophores remains. Multispectral imaging allows the separation of five or more fluorophores, with each signal quantitated and visualized separately. Preclinical small animal imaging is often accompanied by microscopic analysis, both before and after the in vivo phase. This can involve tissue culture manipulations and/or histological examination of fixed or frozen tissue. Due to the same advantages in sensitivity, quantitation, and multiplexing, microscopy-based multispectral techniques form an excellent complement to in vivo imaging.","Institute for Laboratory Animal Research","Review","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

The sparing of nerves during surgical procedures is a vexing problem because surrounding tissue often obscures them. To date, systemically administered nerve-highlighting contrast agents that can be used for nerve-sparing image-guided surgery have not been reported. In the current study, physicochemical and optical properties of 4,49-[(2-methoxy-1,4- phenylene)di-(1E)-2,1-ethenediyl]bis-benzenamine (BMB) and a newly synthesized, red-shifted derivative 4-[(1E)-2-[4-[(1E)-2-[4-aminophenyl]ethenyl]-3- methoxyphenyl]ethenyl]-benzonitrile (GE3082) were characterized in vitro and in vivo. Both agents crossed the blood-nerve barrier and blood-brain barrier and rendered myelinated nerves fluorescent after a single systemic injection. Although both BMB and GE3082 also exhibited significant uptake in white adipose tissue, GE3082 underwent a hypsochromic shift in adipose tissue that provided a means to eliminate the unwanted signal using hyperspectral deconvolution. Dose and kinetic studies were performed in mice to determine the optimal dose and drugimaging interval. The results were confirmed in rat and pig, with the latter used to demonstrate, for the first time, simultaneous fluorescence imaging of blood vessels and nerves during surgery using the FLARE™ (Fluorescence-Assisted Resection and Exploration) imaging system. These results lay the foundation for the development of ideal nerve-highlighting fluorophores for image-guided surgery. © 2011 Decker Publishing.","","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

We present here a portable instrument designed for the in situ simultaneous measurement of autofluorescence emission spectra and temporal decay profiles, permitting the analysis of complex fluorescence signals. This hyperspectral fluorescence lifetime probe utilizes two ultrafast lasers operating at 355 and 440 nm that can excite autofluorescence from many different biomolecules present in skin tissue including keratin, collagen, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate), and flavins. The instrument incorporates an optical fiber probe to provide sample illumination and fluorescence collection over a millimeter-sized area. We present a description of the system, including spectral and temporal characterizations, and report the preliminary application of this instrument to a study of recently resected (<2 h) ex vivo skin lesions, illustrating its potential for skin cancer detection and diagnosis. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.","","Article","","Scopus"

Standard bronchoscopy uses the reflectance/scattering properties of white light from tissue to examine the macroscopic appearance of airways. It does not exploit the full spectrum of the optical properties of bronchial tissues. Advances in optical imaging such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), confocal endomicroscopy, autofluorescence imaging and laser Raman spectroscopy are at the forefront to allow in vivo high-resolution probing of the microscopic structure, biochemical compositions and even molecular alterations in disease states. OCT can visualize cellular and extracellular structures at and below the tissue surface with near histological resolution, as well as to provide three-dimensional imaging of the airways. Cellular and subcellular imaging can be achieved using confocal endomicroscopy or endocytoscopy. Contrast associated with light absorption by haemoglobin can be used to highlight changes in microvascular structures in the subepithelium using narrow-band imaging. Blood vessels in the peribronchial space can be displayed using Doppler OCT. Biochemical compositions can be analysed with laser Raman spectroscopy, autofluorescence or multispectral imaging. Clinically, autofluorescence and narrow-band imaging have been found to be useful for localization of preneoplastic and neoplastic bronchial lesions. OCT can differentiate carcinoma in situ versus microinvasive cancer. Endoscopic optical imaging is a promising technology that can expand the horizon for studying the pathogenesis and progression of airway diseases such as COPD and asthma, as well as to evaluate the effect of novel therapy. © 2011 Asian Pacific Society of Respirology.","","Review","","Scopus"

Analyzing the images based on the pathological findings of the cases studied, we found that light scattering in the breast was contributed from both the nucleus and organelles such as mitochondria and nucleolus. Based on the image analysis of these 14 cases, we found that the differences in the mean size and volume fraction between the malignant and benign lesions are significant. The contrast ratio of the average mean size and volume fraction between malignant and benign lesions were calculated to be 3.38 and 2.63.

In surgical applications it suffers from low illumination levels and motion artefacts. A three-channel rigid endoscope system has been developed that allows simultaneous recording of stereoscopic and multispectral images. Salient features on the tissue surface may be tracked during the acquisition in the stereo cameras and, using multiple camera triangulation techniques, this information used to align the multispectral images automatically even though the tissue or camera is moving. This paper describes a detailed validation of the set-up in a controlled experiment before presenting the first in vivo use of the device in a porcine minimally invasive surgical procedure. Multispectral images of the large bowel were acquired and used to extract the relative concentration of haemoglobin in the tissue despite motion due to breathing during the acquisition. Using the stereoscopic information it was also possible to overlay the multispectral information on the reconstructed 3D surface. This experiment demonstrates the ability of this system for measuring blood perfusion changes in the tissue during surgery and its potential use as a platform for other sequential imaging modalities. © 2012 Optical Society of America.","OSA - The Optical Society","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

A double detection system working in non-descanning mode has allowed both photon counting and a proportional regime. This experimental setup offering high spatial (micrometric) and temporal (sub-nanosecond) resolution has been used to image both ex-vivo and in-vivo biological samples, including cells, tissues, and living animals. Multidimensional imaging was used to spectroscopically characterize human skin lesions, as malignant melanoma and naevi. Moreover, two-color detection of two photon excited fluorescence was applied to in-vivo imaging of living mice intact neocortex, as well as to induce neuronal microlesions by femtosecond laser burning.

Here, we propose multispectral PAFC with multiple dyes having distinctive absorption spectra as multicolor PA contrast agents. As a first step of our proof-of-concept, we characterized high-speed PAFC capability to monitor the clearance of three dyes (Indocyanine Green [ICG], Methylene Blue [MB], and Trypan Blue [TB]) in an animal model in vivo and in real time. We observed strong dynamic PA signal fluctuations, which can be associated with interactions of dyes with circulating blood cells and plasma proteins. PAFC demonstrated enumeration of circulating red and white blood cells labeled with ICG and MB, respectively, and detection of rare dead cells uptaking TB directly in bloodstream. The possibility for accurate measurements of various dye concentrations including Crystal Violet and Brilliant Green were verified in vitro using complementary to PAFC photothermal (PT) technique and spectrophotometry under batch and flow conditions. We further analyze the potential of integrated PAFC/PT spectroscopy with multiple dyes for rapid and accurate measurements of circulating blood volume without a priori information on hemoglobin content, which is impossible with existing optical techniques. This is important in many medical conditions including surgery and trauma with extensive blood loss, rapid fluid administration, and transfusion of red blood cells. The potential for developing a robust clinical PAFC prototype that is safe for human, and its applications for studying the liver function are further highlighted. © 2011 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.","","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Morphological and spectroscopic differences were found between healthy and pathological skin samples, including tumors. In particular, we examined tissue samples from normal and pathological scar tissue (keloid), and skin tumors, including basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and malignant melanoma (MM). By using combined TPE-SHG microscopy we investigated morphological features of different skin regions, as BCC, tumor stroma, healthy dermis, fibroblastic proliferation, and keloids. A score, based on the SHG to autofluorescence aging index of dermis (SAAID), was assigned to characterize each region. We found that both BCC and surrounding dermis have a negative SAAID value, tumor stroma has a positive SAAID value, whereas fibroblastic proliferation and keloids have a SAAID value close to the unit. Further comparative analysis of healthy skin and neoplastic samples was performed using FLIM, SLIM, and MTPE. In particular, BCC showed a blue-shifted fluorescence emission, a higher fluorescence response at 800 nm excitation wavelength and a slightly longer mean fluorescence lifetime. MM showed an emission spectrum similar to the corresponding healthy skin emission spectrum, and a mean fluorescence lifetime distribution shifted towards shorter values. Finally, the use of aminolevulinic acid as a contrast agent has been demonstrated to increase the constrast in BCC border detection.

The migratory mechanism of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) is not completely elucidated, yet many of the initial studies have been based on current understanding of the leukocyte migration. A normal function of MSC is the ability of the cell to migrate to and repair wounded tissue. This wound healing property of MSC originates with migration towards inflammatory signals produced by the wounded environment [1]. A tumor and its microenvironment are capable of eliciting a similar inflammatory response from the MSC, thus resulting in migration of the MSC towards the tumor microenvironment. We have shown MSC migration both in vitro and in vivo. In this chapter, we elucidate several in vivo methods to study MSC migration and mobilization to the tumor microenvironment. The first model is an exogenous model of MSC migration that can be performed in both xenograft and syngenic systems with in vitro expanded MSC. The second model utilizes transgenic-fluorescent-colored mice to follow endogenous bone marrow components including MSC. The third technique enables us to analyze data from the transgenic model through multispectral imaging. Furthermore, the migratory phenotype of MSC can be exploited for use in tumor-targeted gene delivery therapy has been efficacious in animal model studies and is an anticipated therapeutic device in clinical trials. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Humana Press Inc.","Article","","Scopus"

We report the development and validation of a novel molecular imaging paradigm to rapidly assess response to angiogenesis-directed therapeutics in preclinical animal models. Procedures: A monoclonal antibody-based optical imaging probe targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) expression was synthesized and evaluated in vitro and in vivo via multispectral fluorescence imaging. Results: The optical imaging agent demonstrated specificity for the target receptor in cultured endothelial cells and in vivo. The agent exhibited significant accumulation within 4T1 xenograft tumors. Mice bearing 4T1 xenografts and treated with sunitinib exhibited both tumor growth arrest and decreased accumulation of NIR800-αVEGFR2ab compared to untreated cohorts (p = 0.0021). Conclusions: Molecular imaging of VEGFR2 expression is a promising non-invasive biomarker for assessing angiogenesis and evaluating the efficacy of angiogenesis-directed therapies. © Academy of Molecular Imaging 2008.","","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Specifically, reporter gene (RG) expression may be used to signal certain molecular events as they occur in vivo. Objective: To compare the in vivo kinetics of a radiolabeled reporter probe (RP) specifically targeted by RG expression to a non‐specific radiolabel (NSL) in canine bone marrow cells (BMC). Cells were co‐labeled in vitro, transplanted into normal canine myocardium, and tracked using dual‐isotope SPECT. Methods: Following canine bone marrow harvest (n=1), BMCs were isolated, transfected with RG, and grown in culture for 4 weeks. Transfected cells (5.4×106) were then incubated with RP and NSL followed by direct injection into the left canine ventricle. The recipient of transplanted cells was also the donor. Forty 1‐hr SPECT images were acquired to obtain washout kinetics of RP and NSL. Time activity curves (TAC) were generated from SPECT region of interest analysis. After sacrifice, ex vivo measurements of RP and NSL activity remaining in the myocardium were made with a high purity germanium gamma‐ray well counter. Results: Decay‐corrected TACs demonstrated faster washout kinetics for RP compared to NSL with biological half‐lives of 19 and 39 hours, respectively. This suggests that RP loss is greater than that attributed to cell death alone and demonstrates differences in label stability. Ex vivo tissue analysis confirmed these results. Conclusion: Multispectral SPECT shows potential for monitoring RG stability and expression to follow cell viability and function non‐invasively in large animals. © 2006, American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

The area of Cytomics and Systems Biology received great attention during the last years as it harbours the promise to substantially impact on various fields of biomedicine, drug discovery, predictive medicine [6] and may have major potential for regenerative medicine. In regenerative medicine Cytomics includes process control of cell preparation and culturing using non-invasive detection techniques, quality control and standardization for GMP and GLP conformity and even prediction of cell fate based on sophisticated data analysis. Cytomics requires quantitative and stoichiometric single cell analysis. In some areas the leading cytometric techniques represent the cutting edge today. Many different applications/variations of multicolour staining were developed for flow- or slide-based cytometry (SBC) analysis of suspensions and sections to whole animal analysis [78]. SBC has become an important analytical technology in drug discovery, diagnosis and research and is an emerging technology for systems analysis [78]. It enables high-content high-throughput measurement of cell suspensions, cell cultures and tissues. In the last years various commercial SBC instruments were launched principally enabling to perform similar tasks. Standardisation as well as comparability of different instruments is a major challenge. Hyperspectral optical imaging may be implemented in SBC analysis for label free cell detection based on cellular autofluorescence [3]. All of these developments push the systemic approach of the analysis of biological specimens to enhance the outcome of regenerative medicine. © 2008 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

In this work we used combined two photon intrinsic fluorescence (TPE), second harmonic generation microscopy (SHG), fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and multispectral two photon emission detection (MTPE) to investigate different kinds of human ex-vivo fresh biopsies of bladder. Morphological and spectroscopic analyses allowed to characterize both healthy and pathological tissue samples in a good agreement with common routine histology. In particular, we examined tissue samples from bladder normal mucosa, and bladder carcinoma in-situ (CIS), finding both morphological and spectroscopic differences. From the morphological point of view, cancer cells appeared more elongated with respect to corresponding normal cells; they also exhibited a different nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. From the spectroscopic point of view, we found differences between the two tissue types in both spectral emission and fluorescence lifetime distribution.

The technique utilizes multiple regression analysis aided by Monte Carlo simulation for diffuse reflectance spectra. Using the absorbance spectrum as a response variable and the extinction coefficients of melanin, oxygenated hemoglobin, and deoxygenated hemoglobin as predictor variables, multiple regression analysis provides regression coefficients.

Here, we are unique in presenting a murine ischemic wound model that is based on bipedicle flap approach. Using this model of ischemic wounds we have sought to elucidate how microRNAs may be implicated in limiting wound re-epithelialization under hypoxia, a major component of ischemia. Ischemia, evaluated by laser Doppler as well as hyperspectral imaging, limited blood flow and lowered tissue oxygen saturation. EPR oximetry demonstrated that the ischemic wound tissue had pO2 <10 mm Hg. Ischemic wounds suffered from compromised macrophage recruitment and delayed wound epithelialization. Specifically, epithelial proliferation, as determined by Ki67 staining, was compromised. In vivo imaging showedmassive hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) stabilization in ischemic wounds, where HIF-1α induced miR-210 expression that, in turn, silenced its target E2F3,which was markedly down-regulated in thewound-edge tissue of ischemic wounds. E2F3 was recognized as a key facilitator of cell proliferation. In keratinocytes, knock-down of E2F3 limited cell proliferation. Forced stabilization of HIF-1α using Ad-VP16- HIF-1α under normoxic conditions upregulated miR-210 expression, down-regulated E2F3, and limited cell proliferation. Studies using cellular delivery of miR-210 antagomir and mimic demonstrated a key role of miR-210 in limiting keratinocyte proliferation. In summary, these results are unique in presenting evidence demonstrating that the hypoxia component of ischemia may limit wound re-epithelialization by stabilizing HIF-1α, which induces miR-210 expression, resulting in the down-regulation of the cell-cycle regulatory protein E2F3.","","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This fiber-based fluorescence imaging system consists of a slit-scan confocal microscope coupled to an imaging catheter that is designed to be minimally invasive and allow for cellular level imaging in vivo. The system can operate in two imaging modes. The grayscale mode of operation provides high resolution real-time in vivo images showing the intensity of fluorescent signal from the specimen. The multispectral mode of operation uses a prism as a dispersive element to collect a full multispectral image of the fluorescence emission. The instrument can switch back and forth nearly instantaneously between the two imaging modes (less than half a second). In the current configuration, the multispectral confocal microendoscope achieves 3-μm lateral resolution and 30-μm axial resolution. The system records light from 500to750nm, and the minimum resolvable wavelength difference varies from 2.9to8.3nm over this spectral range.

Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) is the most frequently applied nonlinear variant of Raman spectroscopy. The basic concepts of Raman and CARS are introduced first, and subsequent biomedical applications of Raman and CARS are described. Raman microspectroscopy is applied to both in-vivo and in-vitro tissue diagnostics, and the characterization and identification of individual mammalian cells. These applications benefit from the fact that Raman spectra provide specific information on the chemical composition and molecular structure in a label-free and nondestructive manner. Combining the chemical specificity of Raman spectroscopy with the spatial resolution of an optical microscope allows recording hyperspectral images with molecular contrast. We also elaborate on interfacing Raman spectroscopic tools with other technologies such as optical tweezing, microfluidics and fiber optic probes.

The purpose of this technical feasibility pilot study was to evaluate the applicability of NIRF imaging with indocyanin green (ICG) for the detection of the SLN in cervical cancer. Procedures: In ten patients with early stage cervical cancer, a mixture of patent blue and ICG was injected into the cervix uteri during surgery. Real-time color and fluorescence videos and images were acquired using a custom-made multispectral fluorescence camera system. Results: Real-time fluorescence lymphatic mapping was observed in vivo in six patients; a total of nine SLNs were detected, of which one (11%) contained metastases. Ex vivo fluorescence imaging revealed the remaining fluorescent signal in 11 of 197 non-sentinel LNs (5%), of which one contained metastatic tumor tissue. None of the non-fluorescent LNs contained metastases. Conclusions: We conclude that lymphatic mapping and detection of the SLN in cervical cancer using intraoperative NIRF imaging is technically feasible.

Autofluorescence limits (1) the accuracy of differentiating background signals from single and multiple fluorescence labels and (2) reliable quantification of fluorescent signals. Advanced techniques such as hyperspectral imaging and spectral unmixing can be applied to essentially remove this autofluorescent signal contribution, and this work attempts to quantify the effectiveness of autofluorescence spectral unmixing in a tumour xenograft model. Whole-specimen single-channel fluorescence images were acquired using excitation wavelengths of 488 nm (producing high autofluorescence) and 568 nm (producing negligible autofluorescence). These single-channel data sets are quantified against hyperspectral images acquired at 488 nm using a prototype whole-slide hyperspectral fluorescence scanner developed in our facility.

In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the application of multispectral FLIM for medical diagnosis. Central to the clinical translation of FLIM technology is the development of robust, fast, and cost-effective FLIM instrumentation suitable for in vivo tissue imaging. Unfortunately, the predominant multispectral FLIM approaches suffer from limitations that impede the development of high-speed instruments for in vivo applications. We present a cost-effective scanning multispectral FLIM implementation capable of achieving pixel rates on the order of tens of kilohertz, which will facilitate the evaluation of FLIM for in vivo applications. © 2010 Optical Society of America.","","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

We exploit this to map the contour of the closest surface of a buried fluorescent object. This uses a novel algorithm based on the diffusion theory description of light propagation in tissue at each excitation wavelength to derive metrics that define the depth of the top surface of the object. The algorithm was validated using a tissue-simulating phantom. It was then demonstrated in vivo by subsurface brain tumor topography in a rodent model, using the fluorescence signal from protoporphyrin IX that is preferentially synthesized within malignant cells following systemic application of aminolevulinic acid. Comparisons to histomorphometry in the brain post mortem show the spatial accuracy of the technique.

This pilot study was conducted to demonstrate that DOT can be used to visualize the changes in local hemodynamics during seizures. The focal seizure was induced by microinjection of 10 μl of 1.9 mM GABAA antagonist bicuculline methiodide (BMI) into the left parietal neocortex of male Harlen Sprague-Dawley rats, which was imaged by a multispectral continuous-wave DOT system. Functional images were obtained by our finite element based image reconstruction algorithm. A series of dynamic 2D images were obtained to delineate the time course of concentration changes of oxyhaemoglobin, deoxyhaemoglobin, and total hemoglobin in the rat brain during seizure onset. The BMI induced epileptic foci were localized and observed over time from the images obtained. Our results suggest that diffuse optical tomography may be a promising modality for epilepsy imaging due to its ability to localize epileptic foci as well as its potential to map the functional activity in the area of human cerebral cortex in planning of epilepsy surgery. © 2008 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","Article","","Scopus"

This artifact can mask variations due to the object's optical properties, and makes reconstruction of optical/physiological properties difficult. In this work we demonstrate a curvature correction method that removes this artifact and recovers the underlying data, without the necessity of measuring the object's shape. This method is applicable to many optical imaging modalities that suffer from shapebased intensity biases. By separating the spatially varying data (e.g., physiological changes) from the background signal (dc component), we show that the curvature can be extracted by either averaging or fitting the rows and columns of the images. Numerical simulations show that our method is equivalent to directly removing the curvature, when the object's shape is known, and accurately recovers the underlying data. Experiments on phantoms validate the numerical results and show that for a given image with 16.5% error due to curvature, the method reduces that error to 1.2%. Finally, diffuse multispectral images are acquired on forearms in vivo. We demonstrate the enhancement in image quality on intensity images, and consequently on reconstruction results of blood volume and oxygenation distributions. © 2010 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.","","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

To date, the only effective treatment for melanoma remains surgical excision, therefore, the key to extended survival is early detection 2,3. Considering the large numbers of patients diagnosed every year and the limitations in accessing specialized care quickly, the development of objective in vivo diagnostic instruments to aid the diagnosis is essential. New techniques to detect skin cancer, especially non-invasive diagnostic tools, are being explored in numerous laboratories. Along with the surgical methods, techniques such as digital photography, dermoscopy, multispectral imaging systems (MelaFind), laser-based systems (confocal scanning laser microscopy, laser doppler perfusion imaging, optical coherence tomography), ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, are being tested. Each technique offers unique advantages and disadvantages, many of which pose a compromise between effectiveness and accuracy versus ease of use and cost considerations. Details about these techniques and omparisons are available in the literature 4. Infrared (IR) imaging was shown to be a useful method to diagnose the signs of certain diseases by measuring the local skin temperature. There is a large body of evidence showing that disease or deviation from normal functioning are accompanied by changes of the temperature of the body, which again affect the temperature of the skin 5,6. Accurate data about the temperature of the human body and skin can provide a wealth of information on the processes responsible for heat generation and thermoregulation, in particular the deviation from normal conditions, often caused by disease. However, IR imaging has not been widely recognized in medicine due to the premature use of the technology 7,8 several decades ago, when temperature measurement accuracy and the spatial resolution were inadequate and sophisticated image processing tools were unavailable. This situation changed dramatically in the late 1990s-2000s. Advances in IR instrumentation, implementation of digital image processing algorithms and dynamic IR imaging, which enables scientists to analyze not only the spatial, but also the temporal thermal behavior of the skin 9, allowed breakthroughs in the field. In our research, we explore the feasibility of IR imaging, combined with theoretical and experimental studies, as a cost effective, non-invasive, in vivo optical measurement technique for tumor detection, with emphasis on the screening and early detection of melanoma 10-13. In this study, we show data obtained in a patient study in which patients that possess a pigmented lesion with a clinical indication for biopsy are selected for imaging. We compared the difference in thermal responses between healthy and malignant tissue and compared our data with biopsy results. We concluded that the increased metabolic activity of the melanoma lesion can be detected by dynamic infrared imaging. © 2011 Journal of Visualized Experiments.","Journal of Visualized Experiments","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

If untreated, diabetic foot ulcers may become infected and require total or partial amputation of the affected limb. Early identification of tissue at risk of ulcerating could enable proper preventive care, thereby reducing the incidence of foot ulceration. Furthermore, noninvasive assessment of tissue viability around already formed ulcers could inform the diabetes caregiver about the severity of the wound and help assess the need for amputation. This article reviews how hyperspectral imaging between 450 and 700 nm can be used to assess the risk of diabetic foot ulcer development and to predict the likelihood of healing noninvasively. Two methods are described to analyze the in vivo hyperspectral measurements. The first method is based on the modified Beer-Lambert law and produces a map of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations in the dermis of the foot. The second is based on a two-layer optical model of skin and can retrieve not only oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin concentrations but also epidermal thickness and melanin concentration along with skin scattering properties. It can detect changes in the diabetic foot and help predict and understand ulceration mechanisms. © Diabetes Technology Society.","SAGE Publications Inc.","Conference paper","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

To address this issue, a novel approach has been developed that combines MR diffusion imaging with multispectral (MS) analysis to quantify tumor tissue populations. K-means (KM) clustering of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), T2, and proton density (Mo) was employed to estimate the volumes of viable tumor tissue, necrosis, and neighboring subcutaneous adipose tissue in a human colorectal tumor xenograft mouse model. In a second set of experiments, the temporal evolution of the MS tissue classes in response to therapeutic intervention Apo2L/TRAIL and CPT-11 was observed. The multiple parameters played complementary roles in identifying the various tissues. The ADC was the dominant parameter for identifying regions of necrosis, whereas T2 identified two necrotic subpopulations, and Mo contributed to the differentiation of viable tumor from subcutaneous adipose tissue. MS viable tumor estimates (mean volume = 275 ± 147 mm3) were highly correlated (r = 0.81, P < 0.01) with histological estimates (117 ± 51 mm3). In the treatment study, MS viable tumor volume (at day 10) was 77 ± 67 mm3 for the Apo2L/TRAIL+CPT-11 group, and was significantly reduced relative to the control group (292 ± 127 mm3, P < 0.01).

Ultrasmall paramagnetic iron oxide contrast agents for indirect imaging of vasculature offer a method for quantitative measurements of vascular biomarkers such as vessel size index, blood volume, and vessel density. Here, this technique is validated with direct comparisons to ex vivo micro-CT angiography and histologic vessel measurements, showing significant correlations between in vivo vascular MRI measurements and ex vivo structural vessel measurements. The sensitivity of the MRI vascular parameters is also demonstrated, in combination with a multispectral analysis technique for segmenting tumor tissue to restrict the analysis to viable tumor tissue and exclude regions of necrosis. It is shown that this viable tumor segmentation increases sensitivity for detection of significant effects on blood volume and vessel density by two antiangiogenic therapeutics (anti-VEGF and anti-neuropilin-1) on an HM7 colorectal tumor model.

By the multispectral analysis of the Maestro in vivo imaging system the in vivo fate of the nanoparticles next to their accumulation in special red fluorescent DsRed2 expressing HT29 xenografts could be followed. This simultaneous imaging in addition to confocal microscopy studies revealed information about the accumulation characteristics of nanoparticles inside the tumor tissues. This knowledge was further combined with extended size-dependent fluorescence imaging studies at two different xenograft tumor types, the HT29 (colorectal carcinoma) and the A2780 (ovarian carcinoma) cell lines. The combination of two different size measurement methods allowed the characterization of the dependence of nanoparticle accumulation in the tumor on even rather small differences in the nanoparticle size. While two nanoparticle batches (111 and 141 nm in diameter) accumulated efficiently in the human xenograft tumor tissue, the slightly bigger nanoparticles (diameter 166 nm) were rapidly eliminated by the liver. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","","Article","","Scopus"

The positrons emitted by                              18                             F-FDG, travelling into tissues faster than the speed of light in the same medium, are responsible for Cerenkov radiation (CR) emission which is prevalently in the visible range. The purpose of this study is to show that CR escaping from tumour tissues of small living animals injected with                              18                             F-FDG can be detected with optical imaging (OI) techniques using a commercial optical instrument equipped with charge-coupled detectors (CCD). Methods: The theory behind the Cerenkov light emission and the source depth measurements using CR is first presented. Mice injected with                              18                             F-FDG or saline solution underwent dynamic OI acquisition and a comparison between images was performed. Multispectral analysis of the radiation was used to estimate the depth of the source of Cerenkov light. Small animal PET images were also acquired in order to compare the                              18                             F-FDG bio-distribution measured using OI and PET scanner. Results: Cerenkov in vivo whole-body images of tumour-bearing mice and the measurements of the emission spectrum (560-660 nm range) are presented. Brain, kidneys and tumour were identified as a source of visible light in the animal body: the tissue time-activity curves reflected the physiological accumulation of                              18                             F-FDG in these organs. The identification is confirmed by the comparison between CR and                              18                             F-FDG images. Conclusion: These results will allow the use of conventional OI devices for the in vivo study of glucose metabolism in cancer and the assessment, for example, of anti-cancer drugs. Moreover, this demonstrates that                              18                             F-FDG can be employed as it is a bimodal tracer for PET and OI techniques. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

The small area sensed by these probes, however, presents unique challenges when attempting to obtain useful tissue information in-vivo due to the need to maintain constant distance or contact with the target, and tissue deformation. In practice, the effective area can be increased by translating the tip of the probe over the tissue surface and generating functional maps of the underlying tissue response. However, achieving such controlled motions under manual guidance is very difficult, particularly since the probe is typically passed down the instrument channel of a flexible endoscope. This paper describes a force adaptive multi-spectral imaging system integrated with an articulated robotic endoscope that allows a constant contact force to be maintained between the probe and the tissue as the robot tip is actuated across complex tissue profiles.

Oxygen-saturation imaging is possible through near-infrared (NIR) tomography, but has low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This can be augmented by using NIR tomography as an add-on to MRI. Presented are results from a free-standing NIR system and a hybrid MR-guided system for breast imaging. In results from imaging 60 healthy volunteers in the initial NIR system, oxygen saturation was a significant discriminator between the BIRADS classifications of adipose tissue, heterogeneously dense, and extremely dense tissue. By using the MR-guided NIR system, more accurate tissue-specific data were obtained on adipose and fibroglandular volumes, with 11 healthy volunteers. In these data, oxygen saturation in the adipose tissue correlated with percentage of adipose tissue. In two case studies of infiltrating ductal carcinomas, oxygen saturation was reduced at the site of the tumor, as compared with the surrounding healthy tissue, agreeing with conventional thought that hypoxia exists in larger solid tumors. The MRI-guided NIR images of oxygen saturation provide higher resolution and superior SNR and will likely be used in the future to study and characterize specific tissue volumes. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","","Review","","Scopus"

Morphological and spectroscopic differences were found between malignant skin and corresponding healthy skin tissues. In comparison with normal healthy skin, cancer tissue showed a different morphology and a mean fluorescence lifetime distribution slightly shifted towards higher values. Topical application of delta-aminolevulinic acid to the lesion four hours before excision resulted in an enhancement of the fluorescence signal arising from malignant tissue, due to the accumulation of protoporphyrines inside tumor cells. Contrast enhancement was prevalent at tumor borders by both two photon fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging. Fluorescence-based images showed a good correlation with conventional histopathological analysis, thereby supporting the diagnostic accuracy of this novel method. Combined morphological and lifetime analysis in the study of ex-vivo skin samples discriminated benign from malignant tissues, thus offering a reliable, non-invasive tool for the in-vivo analysis of inflammatory and neoplastic skin lesions.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

The technique relies on optical absorption modifications linked to hemodynamic changes. The relative variation of hemodynamic parameters can be quantified using the modified Beer-Lambert Law if changes in reflected light intensities are recorded at two wavelengths or more and the differential path length (DP) is known. The DP is the mean path length in tissues of backscattered photons and varies with wavelength. It is usually estimated using Monte Carlo simulations in simplified semi-infinite homogeneous geometries. Here we consider the use of multilayered models of the somatosensory cortex (SsC) and olfactory bulb (OB), which are common physiological models of brain activation. Simulations demonstrate that specific DP estimation is required for SsC and OB, specifically for wavelengths above 600 nm. They validate the hypothesis of a constant path length during activation and show the need for specific DP if imaging is performed in a thinned-skull preparation. The first multispectral reflectance imaging data recorded in vivo during OB activation are presented, and the influence of DP on the hemodynamic parameters and the pattern of oxymetric changes in the activated OB are discussed. © 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) represents an emerging imaging modality capable of visualizing specific tissue chromophores at high resolution and deep in tissues in vivo by separating their spectral signatures. Whereas single-wavelength images can be acquired by multielement ultrasound detection in real-time imaging, using multiple wavelengths at separate times can lead to image blurring due to motion during acquisition. Therefore, MSOT imaging of the heart results in degraded resolution because of the heartbeat. In this work, we applied a clustering algorithm, k-means, to automatically separate a sequence of single-pulse images at multiple excitation wavelengths into clusters corresponding to different stages of the cardiac cycle. We then performed spectral unmixing on each cluster to obtain images of tissue intrinsic chromophores at different cardiac stages, showing reduced sensitivity to motion compared to signal averaging without clustering. We found that myocardium images of improved resolution and contrast can be achieved using MSOT motion clustering correction. The correction method presented could be generally applied to other MSOT imaging applications prone to motion artifacts, for example, by respiration and heartbeat. © 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

However, many existing techniques and clinical practices are subjective and qualitative due to background bias, tissue heterogeneity, and inter-patient variation. To overcome these limitations, we developed a dual-modal imaging system for in vivo, non-invasive, real-time quantitative assessment of wound tissue oxygenation and perfusion. The imaging system integrated a broadband light source, a high-resolution CCD camera, a highly sensitive thermal camera, and a liquid crystal tunable filter. A user-friendly interface was developed to control all the components systematically. Advanced algorithms were explored for reliable reconstruction of tissue oxygenation and appropriate co-registration between thermal images and multispectral images. Dual-mode oxygenation and perfusion imaging was demonstrated on both benchtop models and human subjects, and compared with measurements using other methods, such as Laser Doppler and tissue oximeter. The test results suggested that the dual-modal imaging system has the potential for non-contact real-time imaging of wound tissue oxygenation and perfusion. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Optimal tension application regimens may be an important component for skin tissue engineering and dermatogenesis. In this study, we designed and tested a novel servo-controlled skin-stretching device to apply predetermined tension and waveforms in mice. The effects of static and cyclical stretching forces were compared in 48 mice by measuring epidermal proliferation, angiogenesis, cutaneous perfusion, and principal growth factors using immunohistochemistry, real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and hyperspectral imaging. All stretched samples had upregulated epidermal proliferation and angiogenesis. Real-time reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction of epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor β1, and nerve growth factor demonstrated greater expression in cyclically stretched skin when compared to static stretch. Hypoxia-induced factor 1α was significantly upregulated in cyclically stretched skin, but poststretch analysis demonstrated well-oxygenated tissue, collectively suggesting the presence of transient hypoxia.

Common changes include angiogenesis and the distortion of the tissue collagen matrix. Such changes affect the colon colouration. This paper presents the principles of a novel optical imaging method capable of extracting parameters depicting histological quantities of the colon. The method is based on a computational, physics-based model of light interaction with tissue. The colon structure is represented by three layers: mucosa, submucosa and muscle layer. Optical properties of the layers are defined by molar concentration and absorption coefficients of haemoglobins; the size and density of collagen fibres; the thickness of the layer and the refractive indexes of collagen and the medium. Using the entire histologically plausible ranges for these parameters, a cross-reference is created computationally between the histological quantities and the associated spectra. The output of the model was compared to experimental data acquired in vivo from 57 histologically confirmed normal and abnormal tissue samples and histological parameters were extracted. The model produced spectra which match well the measured data, with the corresponding spectral parameters being well within histologically plausible ranges. Parameters extracted for the abnormal spectra showed the increase in blood volume fraction and changes in collagen pattern characteristic of the colon cancer. The spectra extracted from multi-spectral images of ex-vivo colon including adenocarcinoma show the characteristic features associated with normal and abnormal colon tissue. These findings suggest that it should be possible to compute histological quantities for the colon from the multi-spectral images.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Consequently, the accurate removal of autofluorescence signal has been a major concern in fluorescence tomography. Here we present a study on three-dimensional mapping and removal of autofluorescence from fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) data, both for phantoms and small animal in vivo. The technique is based on the recording of tomographic data in multiple spectral regions with different excitation light and on the application of a linear unmixing algorithm for targeting multiple fluorescent probes. Two types of measurements are taken, one with the excitation being in the region of the maximum absorption of the targeted fluorophore and one in a region away from the maximum. The relative strengths of the different spectra are employed to calculate the signal to be removed from the tomographic reconstruction. Autofluorescence spectra are recorded using identical reflection geometry as during the FMT acquisitions allowing for the correct mapping of the autofluorescence signal. Results from phantoms exhibiting different background autofluorescence strengths are presented and discussed. In this work we have also studied in vivo fluorescent activity in mice, involving both subcutaneously implanted fluorescent phantoms and blO transgenic mice.","","Conference paper","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

Skin, in particular, has a strong autofluorescence signal, particularly when excited in the blue or green wavelengths. Fluorescence labels with emission wavelengths in the near-infrared are more amenable to deep-tissue imaging, because both scattering and autofluorescence are reduced as wavelengths are increased, but even in these spectral regions, autofluorescence can still limit sensitivity. Multispectral imaging (MSI), however, can remove the signal degradation caused by autofluorescence while adding enhanced multiplexing capabilities.

A novel oxygenation imaging device based on spatial frequency domain and spectral principles has been designed, validated preclinically on pigs, and validated clinically on humans. Importantly, this imaging system has been designed to operate under the rigorous conditions of an operating room. Materials and Methods: Optical properties reconstruction and wavelength selection have been optimized to allow fast and reliable oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin imaging under realistic conditions. In vivo preclinical validation against commercially available contact oxygenation probes was performed on pigs undergoing arterial and venous occlusions. Finally, the device was used clinically to image skin flap oxygenation during a pilot study on women undergoing breast reconstruction after mastectomy. Results: A novel illumination head containing a spatial light modulator (SLM) and a novel fiber-coupled high power light source were constructed. Preclinical experiments showed similar values between local probes and the oxygenation imaging system, with measurement times of the new system being < 500 msec. During pilot clinical studies, the imaging system was able to provide near real-time oxyHb, deoxyHb, and saturation measurements over large fields of view (> 300 cm 2). Conclusion: A novel optical-based oxygenation imaging system has the potential to replace contact probes during human surgery and to provide quantitative, wide-field measurements in near real-time. © 2011 SPIE.","","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Morphological and spectroscopic analyses allowed to characterize both healthy and pathological tissue samples in a good agreement with common routine histology.

Spectral unmixing is a useful technique in multispectral fluorescence imaging for reducing the effects of native tissue autofluorescence and separating multiple fluorescence probes in vivio. While spectral unmixing methods are well established in fluorescence microscopy, which typically rely on precharacterized spectra for each fluorophore. A spectral unmixing algorithm tailored for in vivo optical imaging that is able to find the signal distribution and the pure spectrum of each component is introduced. It is derived from multivariate curve resolution-alternative least square (MCR-ALS) method using multiple constraints such as nonnegative, equality, closure, unimodal, spectral range and normalization. The signal distribution maps help to separate autofluorescence from other probes in the raw images and hence provide better quantification and localization for each probe. The test of mixed spectral samples with abundance fractions generated by Dirichlet distribution demonstrates that the algorithm is robust with different noises and pure spectral. And a quantum dots mouse multispectral fluorescence image has convinced this method.","","Article","","Scopus"

SFDI absorption data are measured at multiple wavelengths and used to fit for the tissue concentration of intrinsic chromophores in each pixel. This is done with a priori knowledge of the basis spectra of common tissue chromophores, such as oxyhemoglobin (ctO 2Hb), deoxyhemoglobin (ctHHb), water (ctH2O), and bulk lipid. The quality of in vivo SFDI fits for the hemoglobin parameters ctO 2Hb and ctHHb is dependent on wavelength selection, fitting parameters, and acquisition rate. The latter is critical because SFDI acquisition time is up to six times longer than planar two-wavelength multispectral imaging due to projection of multiple-frequency spatial patterns. Thus, motion artifact during in vivo measurements compromises the quality of the reconstruction. Optimal wavelength selection is examined through matrix decomposition of basis spectra, simulation of data, and dynamic in vivo measurements of a human forearm during cuff occlusion. Fitting parameters that minimize cross-talk from additional tissue chromophores, such as water and lipid, are determined. On the basis of this work, a wavelength pair of 670 nm/850 nm is determined to be the optimal two-wavelength combination for in vivo hemodynamic tissue measurements provided that assumptions for water and lipid fractions are made in the fitting process. In our SFDI case study, wavelength optimization reduces acquisition time over 30-fold to 1.5s compared to 50s for a full 34-wavelength acquisition. The wavelength optimization enables dynamic imaging of arterial occlusions with improved spatial resolution due to reduction of motion artifacts. © 2010 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.","","Conference paper","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Tracing cell dynamics in the embryo becomes tremendously difficult when cell trajectories cross in space and time and tissue density obscure individual cell borders. Here, we used the chick neural crest (NC) as a model to test multicolor cell labeling and multispectral confocal imaging strategies to overcome these roadblocks. Results. We found that multicolor nuclear cell labeling and multispectral imaging led to improved resolution of in vivo NC cell identification by providing a unique spectral identity for each cell. NC cell spectral identity allowed for more accurate cell tracking and was consistent during short term time-lapse imaging sessions. Computer model simulations predicted significantly better object counting for increasing cell densities in 3-color compared to 1-color nuclear cell labeling. To better resolve cell contacts, we show that a combination of 2-color membrane and 1-color nuclear cell labeling dramatically improved the semi-automated analysis of NC cell interactions, yet preserved the ability to track cell movements. We also found channel versus lambda scanning of multicolor labeled embryos significantly reduced the time and effort of image acquisition and analysis of large 3D volume data sets. Conclusions. Our results reveal that multicolor cell labeling and multispectral imaging provide a cellular fingerprint that may uniquely determine a cell's position within the embryo. Together, these methods offer a spectral toolbox to resolve in vivo cell dynamics in unprecedented detail. © 2010 Kulesa et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Real time images of the fundus are acquired with continuous wavelengths (410-918 nm) to generate a data cube consisting of one spectral and two spatial dimensions. Reflected light from the one-dimensional (1-D) area of the sample is first passed through a grating and is then imaged onto a 12-bit silicone charge- coupled device (CCD) detector. A scanner then proceeds to the next 1-D area of the sample. Acquired image frames contain 256 spatial pixels and 256 wavelengths along rows and columns. Image sequences are scanned along the perpendicular spatial dimension using the push-broom method, whereby the spectrograph and camera are translated under constant velocity with respect to the fundus camera image over 6.6 mm of travel. This set of acquired images contains the full reflected light spectrum at each pixel of a two dimensional area of the retina and ONH. The system employs a focal plane scanner (FPS) using a linear actuator to provide motion.

Consequently, the accurate removal of autofluorescence signal has been a major concern in fluorescence tomography. Here we present a study on three-dimensional mapping and removal of autofluorescence from fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) data, both for phantoms and small animal in vivo. The technique is based on the recording of tomographic data in multiple spectral regions with different excitation light and on the application of a linear unmixing algorithm for targeting multiple fluorescent probes. Two types of measurements are taken, one with the excitation being in the region of the maximum absorption of the targeted fluorophore and one in a region away from the maximum. The relative strengths of the different spectra are employed to calculate the signal to be removed from the tomographic reconstruction. Autofluorescence spectra are recorded using identical reflection geometry as during the FMT acquisitions allowing for the correct mapping of the autofluorescence signal. Results from phantoms exhibiting different background autofluorescence strengths are presented and discussed.

In clinical settings, imaging of local oxygenation or blood perfusion variations can be useful for e.g. detection of skin cancer, detection of early inflammation, effectiveness of peripheral nerve block anesthesia, study of the process of wound healing or localization of the cerebral area causing an epileptic attack. In this study, two oxygenation imaging methods based on multi-spectral techniques were evaluated: one system consisting of a CCD camera in combination with a Liquid Crystal Tunable Filter (420 - 730 nm or 650-1100 nm) and a broad band (white) light source, while the second system was a CCD camera in combination with a tunable multispectral LED light source (450-890nm). By collecting narrowband images at selected wavelengths, concentration changes of the different chromophores at the surface of the tissue (e.g. dO2Hb, dHHb and dtHb) can be calculated using the modified Lambert Beer equation. Two analyzing methods were used to calculate the concentration changes this to reduce the errors caused by movement of the tissue. In vivo measurements were obtained during skin oxygen changes induced by temporary arm clamping to validate the methods and algorithms. Functional information from the tissue surface was collected, in non-contact mode, by imaging the hemodynamic and oxygenation changes just below that surface. Both multi-spectral imaging techniques show promising results for detecting dynamic changes in the hemoglobin concentrations. The algorithms need to be optimized and image acquisition and processing needs to be developed top real time for practical clinical applications. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

The goals of this work were investigation of cutaneous benign and malignant lesions by the methods of LIAFS and RS. Spectra from healthy skin areas near to the lesion were detected to be used posteriori to reveal changes between healthy and lesion skin spectra. Before spectral measurements lesions were classified clinically and dermatoscopically by specialist (P.T.). After procedures all lesions were excised and were investigated by standard histological methods. The set-up consists of a nitrogen laser (337 nm, 14 μJ, 10 Hz), halogen lamp (400-900 nm, 50 W), lenses, filters, optical fibers, and a microspectrometer (PC2000, ""Ocean Optics"", USA). A computer controls these systems. The results, obtained were used to develop multispectral diagnostic algorithms based on the most prominent spectral features from the fluorescence and reflectance spectra of the lesions investigated. In comparison between normal skin and different cutaneous lesion types and between lesion types themselves sensitivities and specificities higher than 90 % were achieved in all cases. These results show a perspective possibility to develop an optical biopsy system for diagnosis and differentiation of the benign and malignant non-melanin pigmented cutaneous lesions with wide clinical applications. Non-invasive and high-sensitive in vivo detection by means of appropriate light sources and detectors should be possible, related to real-time determination of existing pathological conditions.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Mosaicing may offer a means to perform rapid histology at the bedside. A possible barrier toward clinical acceptance is that the mosaics are based on a single mode of grayscale contrast and appear black and white, whereas histology is based on two stains (hematoxylin for nuclei, eosin for cellular cytoplasm and dermis) and appears purple and pink. Toward addressing this barrier, we report advances in digital staining: fluorescence mosaics that show only nuclei, are digitally stained purple and overlaid on reflectance mosaics, which show only cellular cytoplasm and dermis, and are digitally stained pink.With digital staining, the appearance of confocal mosaics mimics the appearance of histology. Using multispectral analysis and color matching functions, red, green, and blue (RGB) components of hematoxylin and eosin stains in tissue were determined. The resulting RGB components were then applied in a linear algorithm to transform fluorescence and reflectance contrast in confocal mosaics to the absorbance contrast seen in pathology. Optimization of staining with acridine orange showed improved quality of digitally stained mosaics, with good correlation to the corresponding histology. © 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

In this study we coupled spectral imaging with fluorescence and white light microscopy to develop new methods for quantifying autophagy and apoptosis. For autophagy, we employed multispectral imaging to examine spectral changes in the fluorescence of LC3-GFP, a chimeric protein commonly used to track autophagosome formation. We found that punctate autophagosome-associated LC3-GFP exhibited a spectral profile that was distinctly different from diffuse cytosolic LC3-GFP. We then exploited this shift in spectral quality to quantify the amount of autophagosome-associated signal in single cells. Hydroxychloroquine (CQ), an anti-malarial agent that increases autophagosomal number, significantly increased the punctate LC3-GFP spectral signature, providing proof-of-principle for this approach. For studying apoptosis, we employed the Prism and Reflector Imaging Spectroscopy System (PARISS ) hyperspectral imaging system to identify a spectral signature for active caspase-8 immunostaining in ex vivo tumor samples. This system was then used to rapidly quantify apoptosis induced by lexatumumab, an agonistic TRAIL-R2/DR5 antibody, in histological sections from a preclinical mouse model. We further found that the PARISS could accurately distinguish apoptotic tumor regions in hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections, which allowed us to quantify death receptor-mediated apoptosis in the absence of an apoptotic marker.

In MAS, images recovered from inside the body using specialized devices are used to visualize and operate on the surgical site but they can also be used to computationally infer in vivo 3D tissue surface shape, soft-tissue morphology, and surgical instrument motion. This information is important for facilitating in vivo biophotonic imaging modalities where the interaction between light and tissue is used to infer the structural and functional properties of the tissue. This article provides a review of the literature for computer vision and image understanding techniques applied to MAS images. The focus of this article is to elucidate a perspective on how computer vision techniques can be used to support and enhance the capabilities of biophotonic imaging modalities during surgery. Note that while MAS encompasses a variety of surgical specializations this review does not involve procedures performed in the interventional suite.

The brightly fluorescent MΦ, however, are not present in the lungs of never smokers. Some investigators have speculated that the intense fluorescence of the MΦ is due to smoke-induced changes in the autofluorescence of naturally occurring (i.e., endogenous) compounds (e.g., NADP). In contrast, other researchers have theorized that the fluorescence is due to the uptake of tobacco smoke particulates (i.e., ""tar""). Studies reported herein were undertaken to test the hypothesis that the origin of the MΦ fluorescence could be profiled with the novel technologies afforded by spectral confocal laser scanning microscopy (sCLSM) and multispectral cytometry (MSC). To this end, spectral emissions were obtained by sCLSM of optical sections of live MΦ isolated from fresh surgically excised human lung tissue and in air-dried lung tissue imprints. Confirmation of spectral profiles of these single cell observations was obtained in population studies with the use of high-throughput MSC in which multispectral analyses were performed with three different lasers. Proof of concept experiments demonstrated that relatively nonfluorescent MΦ from the lungs of nonsmokers became fluorescent upon short-term ex vivo exposure to tobacco smoke tar. Summarily, the studies reported herein document that the fluorescence of human lung MΦ is due to tobacco tar. © 2005 Wiley-Liss. Inc.","","Article","","Scopus"

However, clinical acceptance of many optical imaging devices is hampered by poor reproducibility, low accuracy, and lack of biological interpretation. We developed an in vivo model of ischemic flap for non-contact assessment of wound tissue functional parameters and spectral characteristics. The model was created by elevating the bipedicle skin flaps of a domestic pig from the underlying vascular bed and inhibiting graft bed reperfusion by a silastic sheet. Hyperspectral imaging was carried out on the ischemic flap model and compared with transcutaneous oxygen tension and perfusion measurements at different positions of the wound. Hyperspectral images have also been captured continuously during a post-occlusive reactive hyperemia (PORH) procedure. Tissue spectral characteristics obtained by hyperspectral imaging correlated well with cutaneous tissue oxygen tension, blood perfusion, and microscopic changes of tissue morphology.

Microscopic imaging of fresh tissue samples can circumvent the cost and time associated with conventional histology. Further, intrinsic contrast can provide rich information about a tissue's composition, structure and function, and opens the potential for in-vivo imaging without the need for contrast agents. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we used hyperspectral two-photon microscopy to explore the characteristics of both normal and diseased gastrointestinal (GI) tissues, relying only on their endogenous fluorescence and second harmonic generation to provide contrast. We obtained hyperspectral data at subcellular resolution by acquiring images over a range of two-photon excitation wavelengths, and found excitation spectral signatures of specific tissue types based on our ability to clearly visualize morphology. We present the two-photon excitation spectral properties of four major tissue types that are present throughout the GI tract: epithelium, lamina propria, collagen, and lymphatic tissue. Using these four excitation signatures as basis spectra, linear unmixing strategies were applied to hyperspectral data sets of both normal and neoplastic tissue acquired in the colon and small intestine. Our results show that hyperspectral unmixing with excitation spectra allows segmentation, showing promise for blind identification of tissue types within a field of view, analogous to specific staining in conventional histology. The intrinsic spectral signatures of these tissue types provide information relating to their biochemical composition. Conclusions/Significance: These results suggest hyperspectral two-photon microscopy could provide an alternative to conventional histology either for in-situ imaging, or intraoperative 'instant histology' of fresh tissue biopsies. © 2011 Grosberg et al.","","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Such changes are not always obvious through visual inspection using a direct observation, an endoscopic device or colour photography. This paper presents a method for deriving quantitative estimates of BVF of the colon mucosa from multispectral images of the colon. The method has two stages. In the first (""forward"") stage a physics-based model of light propagation computes the spectra corresponding to a range of instances of the colon tissue, and in particular the spectral changes resulting from changes in the quantity of blood volume fraction, haemoglobin saturation the size and density of scattering particles, and the tissue thickness. In the second stage (""model inversion"") the spectra obtained from the image data are used to derive the values of the above histological parameters. Parametric maps of the blood contents are created by storing at every pixel the BVF value recovered through the model inversion. In a pilot study multispectral images of ex-vivo samples of the colon were acquired from 8 patients. The samples contained histologically confirmed instances of adenocarcinoma and other pathologies. The parametric maps of BVF showed the significant increase in blood volume fraction (up to 75% above that of the surrounding the normal tissue). A Marm-Whtney test wth Bonferroni correction showed that all but one of the differences (a benign neoplastic polyp) are significant (p<0.00015).","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Such systems provide high frame rates that freeze motion but recent Monte Carlo simulations show that scattered light severely limits the practical imaging depth for in vivo applications. A new multi-point scanning architecture for confocal microendoscopy has been developed. The new scanner is based on a relatively simple modification to the slit-scanning geometry that results in a parallelized point-scanning confocal microendoscope that maintains the high frame rate of a slit-scanning system while providing optical performance close to that of a single point scanning system. The multi-point scanner has been incorporated into an existing multi-spectral slit-scanning confocal microendoscope. The new confocal aperture consists of a slit and a rotating low duty cycle binary transmission grating, which effectively produces a set of continuously moving widely spaced illumination points along the slit. The design maintains the ability to rapidly switch between grayscale and multi-spectral imaging modes. The improved axial resolution of the multi-point scanning confocal microendoscope leads to significantly better confocal sectioning and deeper imaging, which greatly improves the diagnostic potential of the instrument. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

In our study we synthesized dual fluorescent HPMA copolymers of different architectures and molecular weights, containing one fluorescent dye coupled via a stable hydrazide bond functioning as the carrier label and the other one modeling the drug bound to a carrier via a pH-sensitive hydrolytically cleavable hydrazone bond. Thus, it was possible to track the in vivo fate, namely distribution, elimination and tumor accumulation, of the polymer drug carrier and a cleavable model drug simultaneously and noninvasively in nude mice using multispectral optical imaging. We confirmed our in vivo results by more detailed ex vivo characterization (imaging and microscopy) of autopsied organs and tumors. There was no significant difference in relative biodistribution in the body between the 30 KDa linear and 200 KDa star-like polymer, but the star-like polymer circulated much longer. We observed a moderate accumulation of the polymeric carriers in the tumors. The accumulation of the pH-sensitive releasable model drug was even higher compared to the polymer accumulation.

To analyze comparatively and as a function of age the simultaneous measurements of the proton density (PD), the relaxation times (T1 and T2), and the longitudinal to transverse relaxation times ratio (T1/T2) of brain regions known to accumulate iron preferentially. METHODS: Twenty-seven human subjects were scanned with the mixed turbo spin echo pulse sequence, which is multispectral in PD, T1, and T2. Quantitative MRI (Q-MRI) maps of PD, T1, T2, and T1/T2 were generated, and region of interest measurements were performed in 5 brain regions, namely, frontal white matter (WM), genu of corpus callosum, caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus. RESULTS: Relaxation time measurements are consistent with results of others and provide further confirmation to our basic understanding of the relaxation effects of iron stores in the brain. Specifically, we found that the iron-rich globus pallidus exhibits enhanced T1 and T2 relaxation relative the iron poorer gray matter tissues (caudate nucleus and putamen) and also relative to the WM matter tissues frontal WM and genu of the corpus callosum). We also observe that under riding this hypothesis-because we do not have independent confirmation-that iron caused relaxation enhancement, are the normal brain aging patterns, which suggest that the brain tissues become wetter with increasing age. Also noted is the virtual removal of age dependence observed for the T1/T2 ratio of WM tissues, further suggesting that this ratio may become of clinical significance in the diagnosis of neoplastic processes as well as for quantifying iron in tissue. CONCLUSIONS:: The theoretical underpinnings of published brain iron Q-MRI techniques have been reviewed. We also examined MR relaxation theory essentials in relation to H-proton relaxation phenomena in diamagnetic tissues as well as theoretical extensions to describe relaxation effects in tissues containing iron deposits with a focus on ferritin. Also reported are in vivo Q-MRI results of 27 human brains obtained with a multispectral technique that uses the mixed turbo spin echo pulse sequence and a model conforming Q-MRI algorithms. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","","Article","","Scopus"

Results: With experimental focus on unstained specimens, we demonstrate the ability to segment tissue images for cancer detection.

Fortunately, the survival rate for early diagnosed patients is relatively high. Therefore, in vivo imaging plays an important role for the detection and treatment of the disease. Accurate prostate cancer localization with noninvasive imaging can be used to guide biopsy, radiotheraphy, and surgery as well as to monitor disease progression. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed with an endorectal coil provides higher prostate cancer localization accuracy, when compared to transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). However, in general, a single type of MRI is not sufficient for reliable tumor localization. As an alternative, multispectral MRI, i.e., the use of multiple MRI-derived datasets, has emerged as a promising noninvasive imaging technique for the localization of prostate cancer; however almost all studies are with human readers. There is a significant inter and intraobserver variability for human readers, and it is substantially difficult for humans to analyze the large dataset of multispectral MRI. To solve these problems, this study presents an automated localization method using cost-sensitive support vector machines (SVMs) and shows that this method results in improved localization accuracy than classical SVM. Additionally, we develop a new segmentation method by combining conditional random fields (CRF) with a cost-sensitive framework and show that our method further improves cost-sensitive SVM results by incorporating spatial information. We test SVM, cost-sensitive SVM, and the proposed cost-sensitive CRF on multispectral MRI datasets acquired from 21 biopsy-confirmed cancer patients. Our results show that multispectral MRI helps to increase the accuracy of prostate cancer localization when compared to single MR images; and that using advanced methods such as cost-sensitive SVM as well as the proposed cost-sensitive CRF can boost the performance significantly when compared to SVM. © 2010 IEEE.","","Article","","Scopus"

It provides the means to determine volumetric images of fluorescent protein concentration by applying the principles of diffuse optical tomography. Using different probes tagged to different proteins or cells, different biological functions and pathways can be simultaneously imaged in the same subject. In this work we present a spectral unmixing algorithm capable of separating signal from different probes when combined with the tomographic imaging modality. We show results of two-color imaging when the algorithm is applied to separate fluorescence activity originating from phantoms containing two different fluorophores, namely CFSE and SNARF, with well separated emission spectra, as well as Dsred- and GFP-fused cells in F5-b10 transgenic mice in vivo. The same algorithm can furthermore be applied to tissue-specific spectroscopy data. Spectral analysis of a variety of organs from control, DsRed and GFP F5/B10 transgenic mice showed that fluorophore detection by optical systems is highly tissue-dependent. Spectral data collected from different organs can provide useful insight into experimental parameter optimisation (choice of filters, fluorophores, excitation wavelengths) and spectral unmixing can be applied to measure the tissue-dependency, thereby taking into account localized fluorophore efficiency. Summed up, tissue spectral unmixing can be used as criteria in choosing the most appropriate tissue targets as well as fluorescent markers for specific applications. © 2007 SPIE-OSA.","Optical Society of America","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Currently vitiligo has a high incidence (1% worldwide) but a poor set of treatment options. Piperine, a compound found in black pepper, is a potential treatment for the depigmentary skin disease vitiligo, due to its ability to stimulate mouse epidermal melanocyte proliferation in vitro and in vivo. The present study investigates the use of multispectral imaging and an image processing technique based on local contrast to quantify the stimulatory effects of piperine on human melanocyte proliferation in reconstructed epidermis. We demonstrate the ability of the imaging method to quantify increased pigmentation in response to piperine treatment. The quantization of melanocyte stimulation by the proposed imaging technique illustrates the potential use of this technology to quickly assess therapeutic responses of vitiligo tissue culture models to treatment non-invasively. © 2011 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Tumor oxygenation studies at microvascular levels can provide understanding of oxygen transport on scales at which oxygen transfer to tissue occurs. To fully grasp the significance of blood oxygen delivery and hypoxia at microvascular levels during tumor growth and angiogenesis, the spatial and temporal relationship of the data must be preserved and mapped. Using tumors grown in window chamber models, hyperspectral imaging can provide serial spatial maps of blood oxygenation in terms of hemoglobin saturation at the microvascular level. We describe our application of hyperspectral imaging for in vivo microvascular tumor oxygen transport studies using red fluorescent protein (RFP) to identify all tumor cells, and hypoxia-driven green fluorescent protein (GFP) to identify the hypoxic fraction. 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma cells, stably transfected with both reporter genes, are grown in dorsal skin-fold window chambers. Hyperspectral imaging is used to create image maps of hemoglobin saturation, and classify image pixels where RFP alone is present (tumor cells), or both RFP and GFP are present (hypoxic tumor cells).

Any single modality typically only furnishes an incomplete picture of the tissue optical response, hence an approach that integrates complementary optical imaging modalities is needed for a more comprehensive non-destructive and minimally-invasive tissue characterization. We have developed a dual-modality system, incorporating optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), that is capable of simultaneously characterizing the 3-D tissue morphology and its biochemical composition. The Fourier domain OCT subsystem, at an 830 nm center wavelength, provided high-resolution morphological volumetric tissue images with an axial and lateral resolution of 7.3 and 13.4 μm, respectively. The multispectral FLIM subsystem, based on a direct pulse-recording approach (upon 355 nm laser excitation), provided two-dimensional superficial maps of the tissue autofluorescence intensity and lifetime at three customizable emission bands with 100 iim lateral resolution. Both subsystems share the same excitation/illumination optical path and are simultaneously raster scanned on the sample to generate coregistered OCT volumes and FLIM images. The developed OCT/FLIM system was capable of a maximum A-line rate of 59 KHz for OCT and a pixel rate of up to 30 KHz for FLIM. The dual-modality system was validated with standard fluorophore solutions and subsequently applied to the characterization of two biological tissue types: postmortem human coronary atherosclerotic plaques, and in vivo normal and cancerous hamster cheek pouch epithelial tissue. © 2010 Optical Society of America.","OSA - The Optical Society","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Following orthotopic implantation, mKate2-expressing cells were detected using multispectral imaging. Results: Flow cytometry-sorted fluorescent populations exhibiting growth curves that were comparable to those of the parental line were selected. mKate2-expressing cells were inoculated orthotopically and formed tumors which were visualized non-invasively, allowing monitoring of tumor growth over time and the assessment of tumor response to temozolomide drug treatment. Conclusion: The strategy reported here led to the successful development of GBM models expressing mKate2 or mCherry.

However, the precise downstream effector mechanisms by which T cells mediate these diverse processes are undefined. In the current study the effects of immune modulation with sulfasalazine were evaluated in a mouse model of PcP-related Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (PcP-IRIS). Recovery of T cell-mediated immunity in Pneumocystis-infected immunodeficient mice restored host defense, but also initiated the marked pulmonary inflammation and severe pulmonary function deficits characteristic of IRIS. Sulfasalazine produced a profound attenuation of IRIS, with the unexpected consequence of accelerated fungal clearance. To determine whether macrophage phagocytosis is an effector mechanism of T cell-mediated Pneumocystis clearance and whether sulfasalazine enhances clearance by altering alveolar macrophage phagocytic activity, a novel multispectral imaging flow cytometer-based method was developed to quantify the phagocytosis of Pneumocystis in vivo. Following immune reconstitution, alveolar macrophages from PcP-IRIS mice exhibited a dramatic increase in their ability to actively phagocytose Pneumocystis. Increased phagocytosis correlated temporally with fungal clearance, and required the presence of CD4+ T cells. Sulfasalazine accelerated the onset of the CD4+ T cell-dependent alveolar macrophage phagocytic response in PcP-IRIS mice, resulting in enhanced fungal clearance. Furthermore, sulfasalazine promoted a TH2-polarized cytokine environment in the lung, and sulfasalazine-enhanced phagocytosis of Pneumocystis was associated with an alternatively activated alveolar macrophage phenotype. These results provide evidence that macrophage phagocytosis is an important in vivo effector mechanism for T cell-mediated Pneumocystis clearance, and that macrophage phenotype can be altered to enhance phagocytosis without exacerbating inflammation. Immune modulation can diminish pulmonary inflammation while preserving host defense, and has therapeutic potential for the treatment of PcP-related immunopathogenesis. © 2010 Wang et al.","","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Because of the high cost of magnetic resonance (MR)- and computed tomography (CT)-based systems, a great deal of effort has gone into developing optical imaging methods, which offer, in some modalities, the promise of high spatial resolution and the ability to detect multiple markers simultaneously However, the ability to image and quantitate fluorescently labeled tumors and other fluorescently labeled markers in vivo has generally been limited by the autofluorescence of the tissue, which reduces the sensitivity of detection and accuracy of quantitation of the labeled target. Multispectral imaging methodology, which spectrally characterizes and computationally eliminates autofluorescence, enhances signal-to-background dramatically, revealing otherwise invisible labeled targets. Signal-to-noise considerations can guide the choice of appropriate sensors for fluorescence-based imaging, which generally does not benefit from the use of highly cooled (and expensive) cameras. Effective use of spectral tools to remove autofluorescence signal requires accurate spectra of the individual components. Using manual and automated algorithms to generate these spectra, it is possible to detect as many as three fluorescent protein-labeled tumors and two separate autofluorescent signals in a single subject.","","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus"

The spectrum of light produced by the source that escapes the subject varies with the depth of the emission source because of the wavelength-dependence of the optical properties of tissue. Consequently, multispectral or hyperspectral data acquisition should help in the 3D localization of deep sources. In this paper, we describe a framework for fully 3D bioluminescence tomographic image acquisition and reconstruction that exploits spectral information. We describe regularized tomographic reconstruction techniques that use semi-infinite slab or FEM-based diffusion approximations of photon transport through turbid media. Singular value decomposition analysis was used for data dimensionality reduction and to illustrate the advantage of using hyperspectral rather than achromatic data. Simulation studies in an atlas-mouse geometry indicated that sub-millimeter resolution may be attainable given accurate knowledge of the optical properties of the animal. A fixed arrangement of mirrors and a single CCD camera were used for simultaneous acquisition of multispectral imaging data over most of the surface of the animal. Phantom studies conducted using this system demonstrated our ability to accurately localize deep point-like sources and show that a resolution of 1.5 to 2.2 mm for depths up to 6 mm can be achieved.

The authors have applied a wide-field spectral imager to freshly resected ovaries of 30 human patients in a study believed to be the first of its magnitude. Endogenous fluorescence was excited with 365-nm light and imaged in eight emission bands collectively covering the 400- to 640-nm range. Linear discriminant analysis was used to classify all image pixels and generate diagnostic maps of the ovaries. Training the classifier with previously collected single-point autofluorescence measurements of a spectroscopic probe enabled this novel classification. The process by which probe-collected spectra were transformed for comparison with imager spectra is described. Sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 51% were obtained in classifying normal and cancerous ovaries using autofluorescence data alone. Specificity increased to 69% when autofluorescence data were divided by green reflectance data to correct for spatial variation in tissue absorption properties. Benign neoplasm ovaries were also found to classify as nonmalignant using the same algorithm.

To correlate in vivo spatial and spectral morphologic changes of short- to long-pulse 532 nm Nd:YAG retinal laser lesions using Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (FD OCT), autofluorescence (AF), fluorescein angiography (FA), and multispectral imaging. Methods. Ten eyes with treatment-naive preproliferative or proliferative diabetic retinopathy were studied. A titration grid of laser burns at 20, 100, and 200 milliseconds was applied to the nasal retina and laser fluence titrated to produce four grades of laser lesion visibility: subvisible (SV), barely visible (BV, light-gray), threshold (TH, gray-white), and suprathreshold (ST, white). The AF, FA, FD-OCT, and multispectral imaging were performed 1 week before laser, and 1 hour, 4 weeks, and 3 and 6 months post-laser. Multispectral imaging measured relative tissue oxygen concentration. Results. Laser burn visibility and lesion size increased in a linear relationship according to fixed fluence levels. At fixed pulse durations, there was a semilogarithmic increase in lesion size over 6 months. At 20 milliseconds, all grades of laser lesion were reduced significantly in size after 6 months: SV, 51%; BV, 54%; TH, 49%; and ST, 50% (P < 0.001), with retinal pigment epithelial proliferation and photoreceptor infilling. At 20 milliseconds, there was healing of photoreceptor inner segment/ outer segment junction layers compared with 100- and 200-millisecond lesions. Significant increases in mean tissue oxygenation (range, four to six units) within the laser titration area and in oxygen concentration across the laser lesions (P < 0.01) were detected at 6 months.Conclusions. For patients undergoing therapeutic laser, there may be improved tissue oxygenation, higher predictability of burn morphology, and more spatial localization of healing responses of burns at 20 milliseconds compared with longer pulse durations over time. © 2011 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.","","Article","","Scopus"

That the tumor microenvironment is highly heterogeneous with significant intratumor and intertumor variability presents a significant challenge in developing effective cancer therapies. Critical to understanding the role of the tumor microenvironment is the ability to dynamically quantify oxygen levels in the vasculature and tissue in order to elucidate the roles of oxygen supply and consumption, spatially and temporally. To this end, we describe the use of hyperspectral imaging to characterize hemoglobin absorption to quantify hemoglobin content and oxygen saturation, as well as dual emissive fluorescent/phosphorescent boron nanoparticles, which serve as ratiometric indicators of tissue oxygen tension. Applying these techniques to a window-chamber tumor model illustrates the role of fluctuations in hemoglobin saturation in driving changes in tissue oxygenation, the two being significantly correlated (r = 0.77). Finally, a green-fluorescence-protein reporter for hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) provides an endpoint for hypoxic stress in the tumor, which is used to demonstrate a significant association between tumor hypoxia dynamics and HIF-1 activity in an in vivo demonstration of the technique. © 2010 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.","","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Capabilities to monitor VEGF expression in vivo can potentially serve as a useful tool for diagnosis, prognosis, treatment planning, monitoring, and research. Here, we present the first report of in vivo hyperspectral molecular imaging strategy capable of monitoring treatment-induced changes in VEGF expression. Experimental Design: VEGF was targeted with an anti-VEGF antibody conjugated with a fluorescent dye and was imaged in vivo using a hyperspectral imaging system. The strategy was validated by quantitatively monitoring VEGF levels in three different tumors as well as following photodynamic treatment. Specificity of the molecular imaging strategy was tested using in vivo competition experiments and mathematically using a quantitative pharmacokinetic model. Results: The molecular imaging strategy successfully imaged VEGF levels quantitatively in three different tumors and showed concordance with results from standard ELISA. Changes in tumoral VEGF concentration following photodynamic treatment and Avastin treatment were shown. Immunohistochemistry shows that (a) the VEGF-specific contrast agent labels both proteoglycanbound and unbound VEGF in the extracellular space and (b) the bound VEGF is released from the extracellular matrix in response to photodynamic therapy, in vivo competition experiments and quantitative pharmacokinetic model-based analysis confirmed the high specificity of the imaging strategy. Conclusion: This first report of in vivo quantitative optical molecular imaging-based monitoring of a secreted cytokine in tumors may have implications in providing tools for mechanistic investigations as well as for improved treatment design and merits further investigation. © 2008 American Association for Cancer Research.","","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

AVMs in the brain, lung, and visceral organs, including the liver and gastrointestinal tract, result in considerable morbidity and mortality. AVMs are the underlying cause of three major clinical symptoms of a genetic vascular dysplasia termed hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), which is characterized by recurrent nosebleeds, mucocutaneous telangiectases, and visceral AVMs and caused by mutations in one of several genes, including activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1). It remains unknown why and how selective blood vessels form AVMs, and there have been technical limitations to observing the initial stages of AVM formation. Here we present in vivo evidence that physiological or environmental factors such as wounds in addition to the genetic ablation are required for Alk1-deficient vessels to develop to AVMs in adult mice. Using the dorsal skinfold window chamber system, we have demonstrated for what we believe to be the first time the entire course of AVM formation in subdermal blood vessels by using intravital bright-field images, hyperspectral imaging, fluorescence recordings of direct arterial flow through the AV shunts, and vascular casting techniques. We believe our data provide novel insights into the pathogenetic mechanisms of HHT and potential therapeutic approaches.","","Article","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Using long silica optical fiber bundles, measurements of light transmission through up to 12 cm of female breast tissue can be acquired simultaneously with MRI scans. The NIR system utilizes six optical wavelengths from 660 to 850 nm using intensity modulated diode lasers nominally working at 100 MHz. Photomultiplier tube detector gain levels are electronically controlled on a time scale of 200 ms, thereby allowing rapid switching of the source to locations around the tissue. There are no moving parts in the detection channels and for each source position, 15 PMTs operating in parallel allow sensitivity down to 0.5 pW/cm 2 at the tissue surface. Images of breast tissue optical absorption and reduced scattering coefficients are obtained using a Newton-type reconstruction algorithm to solve for an optimal solution using the measurement data. In medical imaging, it is beneficial to compare the same tissue volume as seen by a variety of modalities, and perhaps more importantly, there is the hypothesis that one imaging system which has high spatial resolution can be used to enhance the reconstruction of another system which has good contrast resolution. In this study we explore the synergistic benefits of a combined NIR-MRI data set, specifically the ways in which MRI (i.e., high spatial resolution) enhances NIR (i.e., high contrast resolution) image reconstruction. The design, calibration, and performance of the imaging system are described in the context of preliminary phantom tests and initial in vivo patient imaging. Co-registered MRI validates and improves optical property estimation in 2D tomographic image reconstructions when specialized algorithms are used. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.","","Article","","Scopus"

Currently, all glaucoma treatments aim to lower eye pressure by improving fluid exit from the eye. We recently reported the presence of lymphatics in the human eye. The lymphatic circulation is known to drain fluid from organ tissues and, as such, lymphatics may also play a role in draining fluid from the eye. We investigated whether lymphatic drainage from the eye is present in mice by visualizing the trajectory of quantum dots once injected into the eye. Whole-body hyperspectral fluorescence imaging was performed in 17 live mice. Invivo imaging was conducted prior to injection, and 5, 20, 40 and 70min, and 2, 6 and 24h after injection. A quantum dot signal was observed in the left neck region at 6h after tracer injection into the eye. Examination of immunofluorescence-labelled sections using confocal microscopy showed the presence of a quantum dot signal in the left submandibular lymph node. This is the first direct evidence of lymphatic drainage from the mouse eye. The use of quantum dots to image this lymphatic pathway in vivo is a novel tool to stimulate new treatments to reduce eye pressure and prevent blindness from glaucoma. © IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Article","","Scopus"

So far it has never been applied to the Olfactory Bulb (OB), although this structure is particularly well suited to the optical study of brain activation due to the its well defined organization, the ability to physiologically activate it with odorants, and the low depth of the activated layers. To obtain hemodynamics parameters from reflectance variations data, it is necessary to take into account a corrective factor called Differential Pathlength (DP). It is routinely estimated using Monte Carlo simulations, modeling photons propagation in simplified infinite geometry tissue models. The first goal of our study was to evaluate the influence of more realistic layered geometries and optical properties on the calculation of DP and ultimately on the estimation of the hemodynamics parameters. Since many valuable results have been obtained previously by others in the SSc, for the purpose of validation and comparison we performed Monte Carlo simulations in both the SSC and the OB. We verified the assumption of constant DP during activation by varying the hemoglobin oxygen saturation, total hemoglobin concentration and we also studied the effect of a superficial bone layer on DP estimation for OB. The simulations show the importance of defining a finite multilayer model instead of the coarse infinite monolayer model, especially for the SSc, and demonstrate the need to perform DP calculation for each structure taking into account their anatomofunctional properties. The second goal of the study was to validate in vivo multispectral imaging for the study of hemodynamics in the OB during activation.

Image stacks (5 benign, 7 malignant tumors) were analyzed by established software (principal component analysis PCA, hyperspectral classification, spectral profiles). Hyperspectral image datacubes were analyzed and classified by conventional software. In PCA, images at 590-680 nm loaded most onto the first PC which typically contained 95% of the total information. Hyperspectral classification clustered the data highlighting altered mucosa. The spectral profiles clearly differed between the different groups. Hyperspectral imaging can be applied to mucosal surfaces.

However, because of intense light scattering, most organisms and tissues remain inaccessible to current fluorescence microscopy techniques at depths beyond several hundred micrometres. We describe a multispectral opto-acoustic tomography technique capable of high-resolution visualization of fluorescent proteins deep within highly light-scattering living organisms. The method uses multiwavelength illumination over multiple projections combined with selective-plane opto-acoustic detection for artifact-free data collection. Accurate image reconstruction is enabled by making use of wavelength-dependent light propagation models in tissue. By performing whole-body imaging of two biologically important and optically diffuse model organisms, Drosophila melanogaster pupae and adult zebrafish, we demonstrate the facility to resolve tissue-specific expression of eGFP and mCherrry fluorescent proteins for precise morphological and functional observations in vivo.","","Article","","Scopus"

The spectral data are analyzed with a chemometric model, producing a hyperspectral image (a chemogram) used to identify LRP in the interrogated region. In this paper, we describe a FT-IR microscopy system for measurement of the NIR scattering and absorption properties of healthy and diseased regions of human coronary arteries in small volumes (~10 μl). Scattering and absorption coefficients are obtained from sequential 140 um x 140 um regions of interest across the face of 500-micron thick, saline-irrigated fresh coronary artery sections. A customized FTIR microscope, measurement protocol, and inversion algorithm are used for optical property determination, and the system is calibrated using measurements of tissue-simulating phantoms having well-characterized optical properties. Tissue optical properties are co-registered with brightfield transmission images as well as with stained histologic thin sections (H&E, Movat Pentachrome, and Oil Red O) acquired from an immediately-adjacent section. The ultimate goal of these experiments is to establish a mechanistic link between the multivariate model predictions displayed on the InfraReDx chemogram and the light-tissue interactions that govern the measured NIR reflectance spectra.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

A tunable Ti-Sapphire pulsed laser at wavelengths between 700nm - 1000nm is used as the source. Anatomical distribution is determined using MRI in a non-concurrent setting. Time-resolved measurements at multiple wavelengths in the NIR window combined with the anatomical constraints is used to determine a 3D distribution of the functional parameters in vivo.

Multiscale endoscopy platforms that use widefield imaging are needed to better direct the placement of high-resolution probes. Design: Feasibility study. Objective: This study evaluated the feasibility of a single agent, proflavine hemisulfate, as a contrast medium during both widefield and high-resolution imaging to characterize the morphologic changes associated with a variety of GI conditions. Setting: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, and Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, New York. Patients, Interventions, and Main Outcome Measurements: Resected specimens were obtained from 15 patients undergoing EMR, esophagectomy, or colectomy. Proflavine hemisulfate, a vital fluorescent dye, was applied topically. The specimens were imaged with a widefield multispectral microscope and a high-resolution microendoscope. The images were compared with histopathologic examination. Results: Widefield fluorescence imaging enhanced visualization of morphology, including the presence and spatial distribution of glands, glandular distortion, atrophy, and crowding. High-resolution imaging of widefield abnormal areas revealed that neoplastic progression corresponded to glandular heterogeneity and nuclear crowding in dysplasia, with glandular effacement in carcinoma. These widefield and high-resolution image features correlated well with the histopathologic features. Limitations: This imaging approach must be validated in vivo with a larger sample size. Conclusions: Multiscale proflavine-enhanced fluorescence imaging can delineate epithelial changes in a variety of GI conditions. Distorted glandular features seen with widefield imaging could serve as a critical bridge to high-resolution probe placement. An endoscopic platform combining the two modalities with a single vital dye may facilitate point-of-care decision making by providing real-time, in vivo diagnoses. © 2012 American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.","","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The method uses the 3-D surface topography of the animal, which is obtained from a structured light illumination technique. The forward model of photon transport is based on the diffusion approximation in homogeneous tissue with a local planar boundary approximation for each mesh element, allowing rapid calculation of the forward Green's function kernel. Absorption and scattering properties of tissue are measured a priori as input to the algorithm. By using multispectral images, 3-D reconstructions of luminescent sources can be derived from images acquired from only a single view. As a demonstration, the reconstruction technique is applied to determine the location and brightness of a source embedded in a homogeneous phantom subject in the shape of a mouse. The technique is then evaluated with real mouse models in which calibrated sources are implanted at known locations within living tissue. Finally, reconstructions are demonstrated in a PC3M-luc (prostate tumor line) metastatic tumor model in nude mice. © 2007 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.","","Article","","Scopus"

Such high resolution fluorescence imaging is hampered by unwanted signal from intrinsic background fluorescence and scattered light. The signal to background ratio can be improved by using extrinsic contrast agents and greatly enhanced by multispectral imaging methods. Unfortunately, these methods are insufficient for deep tissue imaging where high contrast and speedy acquisition are necessary. Fluorescence lifetime (FLT) is an inherent characteristic of each fluorescent species that can be independent of intensity and spectral properties. Accordingly, FLT-based detection provides an additional contrast mechanism to optical measurements. This contrast is particularly important in the near-infrared (NIR) due to relative transparency of tissue as well as the broad absorption and emission spectra of dyes that are active in this region. Here we report comparative analysis of signal distribution of several NIR fluorescent polymethine dyes in living mice and their correlations with lifetimes obtained in vitro using solution models. The FLT data obtained from dyes dissolved in serum albumin solution correlated well with FLTs measured in vivo. Thus the albumin solution model could be used as a good predictive model for in vivo FLT behavior of newly developed fluorescent reporters. Subsequent experiments in vivo, including monitoring slow release kinetics and detecting proteinuria, demonstrate the complementary nature of FLT for fluorescence intensity imaging. © 2009 SPIE.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Simultaneously, the assessment of organ function related to the uptake and clearance of drugs is of great importance. To this end, we demonstrate an imaging platform capable of high-rate characterization of the dynamics of fluorescent agents in multiple organs using multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT). A spatial resolution of approximately 150 μm through mouse cross-sections allowed us to image blood vessels, the kidneys, the liver and the gall bladder. In particular, MSOT was employed to characterize the removal of indocyanine green from the systemic circulation and its time-resolved uptake in the liver and gallbladder. Furthermore, it was possible to track the uptake of a carboxylate dye in separate regions of the kidneys. The results demonstrate the acquisition of agent concentration metrics at rates of 10 samples per second at a single wavelength and 17 s per multispectral sample with 10 signal averages at each of 5 wavelengths.

It is not uncommon to have a diagnosis confirmed 5 to 10 years after the initial onset of symptoms. Development of a more-sensitive molecular imaging technology to detect structural changes in the joints would lead to earlier diagnosis and quantitative tracking of ankylosis progression. Progressive ankylosis (ank/ank) mice have a loss of function in the Ank gene, which codes for a regulator of PPi transport. In this study, we used these ank/ank mutant mice to assess a noninvasive, quantitative measure of joint ankylosis with near-infrared (NIR) molecular imaging in vivo.Methods: Three age groups (8, 12, and 18 weeks) of ank/ank (15 mice) and wild-type littermates (12 +/+ mice) were assessed histologically and radiographically. Before imaging, OsteoSense 750 (bisphosphonate pamidronate) was injected i.v. Whole-body images were analyzed by using the multispectral Maestro imaging system.Results: OsteoSense 750 signals in the paw joints were higher in ank/ank mice in all three age groups compared with controls. In the spine, significantly higher OsteoSense 750 signals were detected early, in 8-week-old ank/ank mice compared with controls, although minimal radiographic differences were noted at this time point. The molecular imaging changes in the ank/ank spine (8 weeks) were supported by histologic changes, including calcium apatite crystals at the edge of the vertebral bodies and new syndesmophyte formation.Conclusions: Changes in joint pathology of ank/ank mice, as evaluated by histologic and radiographic means, are qualitative, but only semiquantitative. In contrast, molecular imaging provides a quantitative assessment. Ankylosis in ank/ank mice developed simultaneously in distal and axial joints, contrary to the previous notion that it is a centripetal process. NIR imaging might be feasible for early disease diagnosis and for monitoring disease progression in ankylosing spondylitis. © 2011 Tsui et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","","Article","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

The standard biopsy consists of removing a sample of tissue for evaluation and diagnosis, primarily to ascertain the presence of cancer cells by (histo)pathological analyses. However, the advent of new optical imaging modalities and targeted or ""smart"" agents, that have affinity for a select target, suggests the possibility of performing in vivo tissue characterization without the need for sample removal or the wait for histopathologic processing. Here we present work testing and validating a fiber-based confocal fluorescence microscopic imaging system intended for combination with a larger scale imaging modality (i.e. MRI or CT) to be used in image-guided in vivo tissue characterization. Fiber-based confocal fluorescence microscopic imaging experiments were performed (Cellvizio, Mauna Kea Technologies, Paris, France) in vivo in two mouse models including: 1) EGFP-expressing mouse melanoma model and 2) M21 mouse melanoma model. Both models are known to express integrin αvβ3, a cell-surface receptor protein. We also performed an experiment in ex vivo chicken muscle tissue labelled with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-lectin targeted compound. In the mouse models, contrast agents that targeted the integrin were injected and the contrast agent localization in tumor was verified by a whole-body multispectral imager. The fiber-based tool was sensitive enough to detect and image the tissue of interest in all different experiments, and was found appropriate for use in interventional catheter-based procedures.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

To predict diseases such as laryngitis (inflammation of the larynx) via non-contact and minimal invasive measurements we develop an optical system that allows the analysis of the 3-dimensional vocal dynamics by using a high-speed camera and associated software. With a triangulation based sensor and 200 laser generated measuring points the 3D surface can be calculated.

It is currently tested with hard tissue phantoms. Further studies like ex-vivo and in-vivo animal experiments are planned. The final goal is to develop reliable and robust hardware and software to automatically distinguish between cancerous and normal tissue. In sports applications but also in other areas higher performance of depth vision results in lower reaction times and higher precision. Literature proves that vision can be improved by perceptual training. We develop a virtual training system for depth vision of sportsman. As a first step the performance of depth vision is evaluated by an interactive gesture controlled vision test that simulates depth by stereo rendering. These examples show that photonics in medicine helps to better understand human body and thus produces new fields of application in diagnostics and therapy.","Laser Institute of America","Conference paper","","Scopus"

The set of subjects was divided in a training set (12 subjects) and an evaluation set (13 subjects). Four different classifiers and two human MRI readers determined the percentages of calcified tissue, fibrous tissue, lipid core, and intraplaque hemorrhage on the subject level for all subjects in the evaluation set. Quantification of the relatively small amounts of calcium could not be done with statistical significance by either the classifiers or the MRI readers. For the other tissues a simple Bayesian classifier (Bayes) performed better than the other classifiers and the MRI readers. All classifiers performed better than the MRI readers in quantifying the sum of hemorrhage and lipid proportions.

This offers the potential for real-time tissue characterization, functional assessment, and intra-operative guidance. One of the key requirements for in vivo consideration is to minimise the acquisition window to avoid tissue motion and deformation, whilst making the best use of the available photons to account for correlation or redundancy between different dimensions. The purpose of this paper is to propose a feature selection framework to identify the best combination of features for discriminating between different tissue classes such that redundant or irrelevant information can be avoided during data acquisition. The method is based on a Bayesian framework for feature selection by using the receiver operating characteristic curves to determine the most pertinent data to capture. This represents a general technique that can be applied to different multi-modal imaging modalities and initial results derived from phantom and ex vivo tissue experiments demonstrate the potential clinical value of the technique. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","Springer Verlag","Conference paper","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus"

EGFP has previously been widely used as a fluorescent protein marker. EGFP-EGF1 protein was thiolated and conjugated to the malemide covering on the pegylated nanoparticles (NP) to form the EGFP-EGF1-NP. The EGFP-EGF1-NP was characterized in terms of morphology, size and zeta potential. In vitro cell viability experiment confirmed that the biodegradable EGFP-EGF1-NP was safe. To evaluate the delivering ability of EGFP-EGF1-NP, a fluorochrome dye, Dir, was incorporated into the nanoparticle, and the loading capacity and release property of the particle were examined. In vitro results showed that the binding ability of EGFP-EGF1-NP with TF-expressing cells was significantly stronger than that of non-conjugated NP. In vivo multispectral fluorescent imaging demonstrated that EGFP-EGF1-NP had high specificity and sensitivity in targeting thrombi.

The MDM acquires in vivo images of oral tissue in fluorescence, narrow-band (NB) reflectance, and orthogonal polarized reflectance (OPR) modes, to enable evaluation of lesions that may not exhibit high contrast under standard white light illumination. The device rapidly captures image sequences so that the diagnostic value of each modality can be qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated alone and in combination. As part of a pilot clinical trial, images are acquired from normal volunteers and patients with precancerous and cancerous lesions. In normal subjects, the visibility of vasculature can be enhanced by tuning the reflectance illumination wavelength and polarization. In patients with histologically confirmed neoplasia, we observe decreased blue/green autofluorescence and increased red autofluorescence in lesions, and increased visibility of vasculature using NB and OPR imaging. The perceived lesion borders change with imaging modality, suggesting that multimodal imaging has the potential to provide additional diagnostic information not available using standard white light illumination or by using a single imaging mode alone. © 2008 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.","","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

For Optical Bioluminescence Tomography (OBT) in small animals, the animal's surface to-pography can be reconstructed from structured light measurements, but internal anatomy is unavailable unless additional CT or MR images are acquired. We present a novel method for estimating the internal organ structure of a mouse by warping a labeled 3D volumetric mouse atlas with the constraint that the surfaces of the two should match. Surface-constrained harmonic maps used for this bijective warping are computed by minimizing the covariant harmonic energy. We demonstrate the application of this warping scheme in OBT, where scattering and absorption coefficients of tissue are functions of the internal anatomy and hence, better estimates of the organ structures can lead to a more accurate forward model resulting in improved source localization. We first estimated the subject's internal geometry using the atlas-based warping scheme. Then the mouse was tessellated and optical properties were assigned based on the estimated organ structure. Bioluminescent sources were simulated, an optical forward model was computed using a finite-element solver, and multispectral data were simulated. We evaluate the accuracy of the forward model computed using the warped atlas against that assuming a homogeneous mouse model. This is done by comparing each model against a 'true' optical forward model where the anatomy of the mouse is assumed known. We also evaluate the impact of anatomical alignment on bioluminescence source localization.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Coupling LCTF with charge coupled device (CCD) technology and acquiring images at multiple, contiguous wavelengths and at narrow bandwidths are formatted into a hyperspectral data cube consisting of one spectral and two spatial dimensions.

As an example, both systems are used to collect spectral data from a 27.22 kg porcine kidney whose renal artery has been occluded for 60 minutes.

Development of new pO2 measurement modalities with simultaneous monitoring of pO2 in larger fields of view with higher spatial and/or temporal resolution will enable greater insight into the functioning of the normal brain and will also have significant impact on diagnosis and treatment of neurovascular diseases such as stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and head injury. Optical imaging modalities have shown a great potential to provide high spatiotemporal resolution and quantitative imaging of pO2 based on hemoglobin absorption in visible and near infrared range of optical spectrum. However, multispectral measurement of cerebral blood oxygenation relies on photon migration through the highly scattering brain tissue. Estimation and modeling of tissue optical parameters, which may undergo dynamic changes during the experiment, is typically required for accurate estimation of blood oxygenation. On the other hand, estimation of the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) based on oxygen-dependent quenching of phosphorescence should not be significantly affected by the changes in the optical parameters of the tissue and provides an absolute measure of pO2. Experimental systems that utilize oxygen-sensitive dyes have been demonstrated in in vivo studies of the perfused tissue as well as for monitoring the oxygen content in tissue cultures, showing that phosphorescence quenching is a potent technology capable of accurate oxygen imaging in the physiological pO2 range. Here we demonstrate with two different imaging modalities how to perform measurement of pO2 in cortical vasculature based on phosphorescence lifetime imaging. In first demonstration we present wide field of view imaging of pO2 at the cortical surface of a rat. This imaging modality has relatively simple experimental setup based on a CCD camera and a pulsed green laser. An example of monitoring the cortical spreading depression based on phosphorescence lifetime of Oxyphor R3 dye was presented. In second demonstration we present a high resolution two-photon pO2 imaging in cortical micro vasculature of a mouse. The experimental setup includes a custom built 2-photon microscope with femtosecond laser, electro-optic modulator, and photon-counting photo multiplier tube. We present an example of imaging the pO2 heterogeneity in the cortical microvasculature including capillaries, using a novel PtP-C343 dye with enhanced 2-photon excitation cross section.","Journal of Visualized Experiments","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

This is because tissue attenuation in this spectral band is relatively low, allowing optical photons even from deep sites in tissue to reach the animal surface and consequently be detected by a CCD camera. The wavelength dependence of tissue optical properties within the 680-850 nm band can be exploited for emitted light by measuring fluorescent data via multispectral approaches and incorporating the spectral dependence of these optical properties into the OFT inverse problem - that of reconstructing underlying 3D fluorescent probe distributions from optical data collected on the animal surface. However, in the aforementioned spectral band, due to only small variations in the tissue optical properties, multispectral emission data, though superior for image reconstruction compared to achromatic data, tend to be somewhat redundant. A different spectral approach for OFT is to capitalize on the larger variations in the optical properties of tissue for excitation photons than for the emission photons by using excitation at multiple wavelengths as a means of decoding source depth in tissue. The full potential of spectral approaches in OFT can be realized by a synergistic combination of these two approaches, that is, exciting the underlying fluorescent probe at multiple wavelengths and measuring emission data multispectrally. In this paper, we describe a method that incorporates both excitation and emission spectral information into the OFT inverse problem. We describe a linear algebraic formulation of the multiple wavelength illumination-multispectral detection forward model for OFT and compare it to models that use only excitation at multiple wavelengths or those that use only multispectral detection techniques. This study is carried out in a realistic inhomogeneous mouse atlas using singular value decomposition and analysis of reconstructed spatial resolution versus noise. For simplicity, quantitative results have been shown for one representative fluorescent probe (Alexa 700) and effects due to tissue autofluorescence have not been taken into account. We also demonstrate the performance of our method for 3D reconstruction of tumors in a simulated mouse model of metastatic human hepatocellular carcinoma. © 2009 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Three samples of Liberkühn colon adenocarcinomas have been studied: common, mucinous and treated by radiochemotherapy. For each sample, several specific zones have been chosen, based on their visual staging and polarimetric responses, which have been correlated to the histology of the corresponding cuts. The most relevant polarimetric images are those quantifying the depolarization for incident linearly polarized light. The measured depolarization depends on several factors, namely the presence or absence of tumor, its exophytic (budding) or endophytic (penetrating) nature, its thickness (its degree of ulceration) and its level of penetration in deeper layers (submucosa, muscularis externa and serosa). The cellular density, the concentration of stroma, the presence or absence of mucus and the light penetration depth, which increases with wavelength, are also relevant parameters. Our data indicate that the tissues with the lowest and highest depolarizing powers are respectively mucus-free tumoral tissue with high cellular density and healthy serosa, while healthy submucosa, muscularis externa as well as mucinous tumor probably feature intermediate values. Moreover, the specimen coming from a patient treated successfully with radiochemotherapy exhibited a uniform polarimetric response typical of healthy tissue even in the initially pathological zone.

While spectral unmixing methods are well established in fluorescence microscopy, they typically rely on precharacterized in-vitro spectra for each fluorophore. However, there are unique challenges for in-vivo applications, since the tissue absorption and scattering can have a significant impact on the measured spectrum of the fluorophore, and therefore make the in-vivo spectra substantially different to that of in vitro. In this work, we introduce a spectral unmixing algorithm tailored for in-vivo optical imaging that does not rely on precharacterized spectral libraries. It is derived from a multivariate curve resolution (MCR) method, which has been widely used in studies of chemometrics and gene expression. Given multispectral images and a few straightforward constraints such as non-negativity, the algorithm automatically finds the signal distribution and the pure spectrum of each component. Signal distribution maps help separate autofluorescence from other probes in the raw images and hence provide better quantification and localization for each probe. The algorithm is demonstrated with an extensive set of in-vivo experiments using near-infrared dyes and quantum dots in both epi-illumination and transillumination geometries. © 2009 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.","","Article","","Scopus"

Bioluminescence light, however, is strongly scattered in biological tissue and no direct image of the light-emitting reporter probe's location can be obtained. Therefore, the authors have developed a linear image reconstruction method for bioluminescence tomography (BLT) that recovers the three-dimensional spatial bioluminescent source distribution in small animals. Methods: The proposed reconstruction method uses third-order simplified spherical harmonics (SP3) solutions to the equation of radiative transfer for modeling the bioluminescence light propagation in optically nonuniform tissue. The SP3 equations and boundary conditions are solved with a finite-difference (FD) technique on a regular grid. The curved geometry of the animal surface was taken into account with a blocking-off region method for regular grids. Coregistered computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images provide information regarding the geometry of the skin surface and internal organs. The inverse source problem is defined as an algebraic system of linear equations for the unknown source distribution and is iteratively solved given multiview and multispectral boundary measurements. The average tissue absorption parameters, which are used for the image reconstruction process, were calculated with an evolution strategy (ES) from in vivo measurements using an implanted pointlike source of known location and spectrum. Moreover, anatomical information regarding the location of the internal organs and other tissue structures within the animal's body are provided by coregistered MR images. Results: First, the authors recovered the wavelength-dependent absorption coefficients (average error of 14%) with the ES under ideal conditions by using a numerical mouse model. Next, they reconstructed the average absorption coefficient of a small animal by using an artificial implanted light source and the validated ES. Last, they conducted two in vivo animal experiments and recovered the spatial location of the implanted light source and the spatial distribution of a bioluminescent reporter system located in the kidneys. The source reconstruction results were coregistered to CT and MR images. They further found that accurate bioluminescence image reconstructions could be obtained when segmenting a voidlike cyst with low-scattering and absorption parameters, whereas inaccurate image reconstructions were obtained when assuming a uniform optical parameter distribution instead. The image reconstructions were completed within 23 min on a 3 GHz Intel processor. Conclusions: The authors demonstrated on in vivo examples that the combination of anatomical coregistration, accurate optical tissue properties, multispectral acquisition, and a blocking-off FD- SP 3 solution of the radiative transfer model significantly improves the accuracy of the BLT reconstructions. © 2010 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","John Wiley and Sons Ltd","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Methods: Endogenous multispectral FLIM imaging was performed on the lumen of 58 segments of postmortem human coronary artery. The fluorescence was separated into three emission bands targeting the three main arterial endogenous fluorophores (390 ± 20. nm for collagen, 452 ± 22.5. nm for elastin, and 550 ± 20 for lipids). The fluorescence normalized intensity and average lifetime from each emission band was used to classify each pixel of an image as either "" High-Collagen"" , "" High-Lipids"" or "" Low-Collagen/Lipids"" via multiclass Fisher's linear discriminant analysis. Results: Classification of plaques as either "" High-Collagen"" , "" High-Lipids"" or "" Low-Collagen/Lipids"" based on the endogenous multispectral FLIM was achieved with a sensitivity/specificity of 96/98%, 89/99%, and 99/99%, respectively, where histopathology served as the gold standard. Conclusion: The endogenous multispectral FLIM approach we have taken, which can readily be adapted for in vivo intravascular catheter based imaging, is capable of reliably identifying plaques with high content of either collagen or lipids. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Two CMOS-cameras, with apochromatic lenses and dual-band LED-arrays, simultaneously streamed Left (L) and Right (R) image data to a dual-processor PC. Both cameras captured color images within the visible range (VIS, 400-780 nm) and grey-scale images within the near infrared range (NIR, 910-920 nm) by sequentially switching between LED-array emission bands. Image-size-settings of 1280 × 1024 for VIS & 640 × 512 for NIR produced 12 cycles/s (1 cycle = 1 VIS L&R-pair + 1 NIR L&R-pair). Decreasing image-size-settings (640 × 512 for VIS and 320 × 256 for NIR) increased camera-speed to 25 cycles/s. Contrasts from below the tissue surface were algorithmically distinguished from surface shadows, reflections, etc. Thus blood vessels were selectively enhanced and back-projected into the stereoscopic VIS-color-image using either a 3D-display or conventional shutter glasses. As a first usability reconnaissance we applied this custom-built mobile stereoscopic camera for several clinical settings: • blood withdrawal; • vein inspection in dark skin; • vein detection through iodide; • varicose vein and nevi pigmentosum inspection. Our technique improves blood vessel visualization compared to the naked eye, and supports depth perception. © Biomedical Engineering Society 2006.","","Article","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus"

However, the clinical presentation is often complex and the evaluation subjective. Multispectral image analysis of melanomas allows selection of features related to the content and distribution of absorbers, mainly melanin and hemoglobin, present within the lesion. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the same features might be useful to predict melanoma thickness. Methods: A multispectral image system was used to analyze in vivo 1939 pigmented skin lesions. The lesion selection was based on clinical and/or dermoscopic features that supported a suspicion for melanoma. All the lesions were then subjected to surgery for the histopathological diagnosis, and 250 were melanomas. From the multispectral images of the melanomas, we selected 12 features, seven of which were used to train and test an artificial neural network on 155 and 95 melanomas, respectively. Results: Sensitivity (i.e., melanoma ≥0.75 mm thick correctly classified) and specificity (i.e., melanoma <0.75 mm thick correctly classified) evaluated from the receiving operating characteristic curves ranged from 76 to 90% and from 91 to 74%, respectively. Conclusions: Our approach provides results similar to those obtained with other methods and has the advantage that it is not related to the expertise of the clinician. In addition, the physical interpretation of the selected features suggests a possible role of spectrophotometry as an objective method to study the natural history of the early phases of the disease.","Il Pensiero Scientifico Editore s.r.l.","Article","","Scopus"

Video endoscopy has become routine in clinics all over the world. Moreover, video endoscopy systems recently performed a technological change from PAL/NTSC image resolution to HDTV. There is a vast amount of literature on in-vivo and in-vitro experiments with multi-spectral point and imaging instruments. The literature demonstrates that document that the spectral information can provide valuable support for diagnosis. Due to the fact that spectral imaging equipment was too slow to acquire hyper-spectral image stacks at reasonable video rates, intra-surgery hyperspectral measurements were limited to point measurements in the past. But the availability of fast and versatile acousto optical tunable filters (AOTF) with switching times in the microsecond range made the application of a hyper-spectral video endoscope technically feasible. This paper describes a demonstrator of a hyper-spectral video endoscope and the results of the first clinical studies. The results show that hyper-spectral video endoscopy exhibits a large potential to become an important imaging technology for medical imaging devices that provide additional diagnostic information about the tissue under investigation. ©2010 IEEE.","","Conference paper","","Scopus"

However, metastasis is still the single most challenging obstacle for successful cancer management. In a new twist that may require some retooling of this established approach, we investigated the hypothesis that tumor metastases can occur via an independent fluid-conducting system called the primo-vascular system. Procedures: The dissemination and growth of near-infrared quantum dot (NIR QD)-electroporated cancer cells in metastatic sites were investigated using in vivo multispectral imaging techniques. Results: Our results show that the NIR QD-labeled cancer cells were able to migrate through not only the blood vascular and lymphatic systems but also the primo-vascular system extending from around the tumor to inside the abdominal cavity. Furthermore, the NIR QD-labeled cancer cells, which had been seeded intraperitoneally, specifically infiltrated the primo-vascular system in the omentum and in the gonadal fat. Conclusions: These findings strongly suggest that the primo-vascular system may be an additional metastasis route, complementing the lymphatic and hematogenous routes, which facilitate the dissemination and colonization of cancer cells at secondary sites. © 2010 Academy of Molecular Imaging and Society for Molecular Imaging.","","Article","","Scopus"

Biomedical optics has been successfully used to qualitatively and quantitatively estimate the microcirculatory conditions of superficial skin. Capillaroscopy, laser Doppler techniques and spectroscopy, all elucidate different aspects of microcirculation, e.g. capillary anatomy and distribution, tissue perfusion and hemoglobin oxygenation. We demonstrate the use of a diffuse reflectance hyperspectral imaging system for spatial and temporal characterization of tissue oxygenation, important to skin viability. The system comprises: light source, liquid crystal tunable filter, camera objective, CCD camera, and the decomposition of the spectral signature into relative amounts of oxy- and deoxygenized hemoglobin as well as melanin in every pixel resulting in tissue chromophore images. To validate the system, we used a phototesting model, creating a graded inflammatory response of a known geometry, in order to evaluate the ability to register spatially resolved reflectance spectra. The obtained results demonstrate the possibility to describe the UV inflammatory response by calculating the change in tissue oxygen level, intimately connected to a tissue's metabolism.

The FSS is based on the principles of single-pixel illumination and detection via a raster scanning technique. The principal components of the scanner are a laser light source, a pair of horizontal and vertical scanning mirrors to deflect the laser light in these respective directions on the tissue surface, and a photo multiplier tube (PMT) detector. This paper characterizes the performance of the FSS for fluorescence imaging of tissues in vivo. First, a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) analysis is presented. This is followed by characterization of the experimental SNR, linearity and spatial resolution of the FSS. Finally, the feasibility of tissue fluorescence imaging is demonstrated using an animal model. In summary, the performance of the FSS is comparable to that of fluorescence-imaging systems based on multipixel illumination and detection. The primary advantage of the FSS is the order-of-magnitude reduction in the cost of the light source and detector. However, the primary disadvantage of the FSS its significantly slower frame rate (1 Hz). In applications where high frame rates are not critical, the FSS will represent a low-cost alternative to multichannel fluorescence imaging-systems.","","Article","","Scopus"

To describe our experience with a noncontact in vivo fluorescence imaging device for the detection and localization of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Materials and methods. Sixty-two women with abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) smears, and 4 women with normal Pap smears, were recruited to undergo fluorescence imaging of the cervix during colposcopy. After topically applying dilute acetic acid, the surface of the cervix was scanned with 365 nm ultraviolet light for about 12 sec. Colposcopy and biopsies of visualized lesions were then performed. The fluorescence emission curves generated by normal cervical tissue and various states of cervical pathology were inspected and assigned relative scores of 1-5 based on the height and slope of the curves at peak fluorescence emissions. A score of 1 indicated a curve with high magnitude and distinct peak, and a score of 5 described a curve of low magnitude and rounded/flattened peak. Scores of 2-4 represented curves with incremental changes of about 25% in the height of the curve between scores of 1 and 5. Biopsies were classified as high grade (HG, CIN 2/3), low grade (LG, HPV/CIN 1), or nondysplastic (ND). Among women with abnormal Pap smears, only those who had biopsies with concordant interpretations by two independent pathologists were included in the descriptive analysis. All of the patients with normal Pap smears were included. Results. A total of 35 women were included in the analysis. Of 62 women with abnormal Pap smears who underwent fluorescence imaging and colposcopy, 31 met the inclusion criteria. Among these 31 women, Pap smears consisted of 6 atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), 16 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LGSILs), and 9 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HGSILs). Of the 4 women with normal Pap smears, 1 had an abnormal colposcopy and a nondysplastic biopsy. Among all 35 women, 42 total biopsies were included, consisting of 11 HG, 25 LG, and 6 ND. Normal squamous tissue generated a score of 1, normal metaplastic tissue a score of 2 or 3, and normal columnar tissue of score of 5 in 35/35 (100%) women. Among the 11 HG lesions, 8 had a score of 4 and 2 had a score of 5. One case was uninterpretable due to a low signal-to-noise ratio. Among the 25 LG lesions, 15 had a score of 3, 6 had a score of 4 or 5, 2 had a score of 1, and 2 cases were uninterpretable. Conclusions. HG lesions generated spectra distinct from normal tissue in 8/10 (80%) evaluable cases, but LG lesions generated spectra indistinguishable from that of normal metaplastic tissue. Further modifications to this technique are needed before an objective, reproducible, and discriminatory scoring system can be developed.","","Article","","Scopus"

There is growing evidence that the success of such procedures depends on the composition of the plaque. In this study, this problem has been addressed by applying tissue characterisation techniques to intravascular ultrasound data obtained from a set of in vitro specimens of known pathology using a radiofrequency data acquisition system interfaced to a commercial intravascular scanner. We found that the attenuation slope of plaque is significantly increased in areas of nonfibrous plaque. This increase in attenuation slope is sufficiently high to allow it to be parametrically imaged and combined with gray-scale imaging as a color overlay. Comparison with histologic sections shows that nonfibrous plaque can be detected even when it is not visible on the gray-scale image. In addition, specular reflections may be readily distinguished from calcifications. Limited in vivo studies are consistent with the hypothesis that there is a relationship between plaque dissection and areas (probably calcification) detected by this method. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.","John Wiley and Sons Inc.","Article","","Scopus"

The main concept is to add high resolution spectral information to the intensity data to improve imaging capabilities. The system is based on an imaging spectrograph, ImSpector, coupled to a CCD camera. The system has been characterized and calibrated. Spectral imaging of tissue samples stained with fluorescent dyes has been performed to validate the principle and the 2-D imaging capabilities. Near infrared 3-D in vivo fluorescence tomography is based on the intensity and spatial distribution of the fluorescent light reaching the surface of the animal as a function of the localized external excitation position. Based on the fact that the absorption coefficient of tissue is wavelength dependent, the measured spectrum of the fluorescent light will provide additional information, thus allowing an improvement of the 3-D reconstruction. By using solely spectral data we have demonstrated the capability of determining the 3-D position of a localized source within a red meat phantom.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Conference paper","","Scopus"

The optical diagnosis system was based on an OPO laser for multi-wavelength excitation and time-resolved detection. The pulsed Nd-YAG-pumped OPO laser system (6 ns, 20 Hz) is compact and has a rapid, broad, and uniform tuning range. Time-gated detection of intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) making use of external triggering was used to effectively eliminate the laser scattering and contribute to the highly sensitive in vivo measurements. Artificial tissue-simulating phantoms consisting of polystyrene microspheres and tissue fluorophores were tested to optimize the gating parameters. 51-ns gate width and 39-ns gate delays were determined to be the optimal parameters for sensitive detection. In vivo measurements with the optical diagnosis system were applied to esophagus, stomach, and small intestine using an endoscope in canine animal studies. The rapid tuning capability of the optical diagnosis system contributed greatly to the optimization of wavelength for the observation of porphyrin in the small intestine. When the small intestine was thoroughly washed with water, the emission band which corresponds to porphyrin disappeared. Based on this observation, it was concluded that the detected signal was yielded by porphyrin-containing bile secretion. Also, multispectral analyses using multiple excitations from 415 to 480 nm at 5 nm intervals confirmed the porphyrin detection in the small intestine. The optical diagnosis system was also applied to the detection of human xenograft of oral carcinoma in mice using 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) which is a photodynamic therapy (PDT) drug. Significant differences in protoporphyrin IX fluorescence intensity between normal and tumor tissue could be obtained 2 hours after the injection of 5-ALA into mice due to the preferential accumulation of 5-ALA in tumors. Results reported herein demonstrate potential capabilities of the LIF-OPO system for in vivo disease diagnosis.","Adenine Press","Article","","Scopus"

The majority of this research is performed with point-like probes. Typically, clinicians select probe sites visually, collecting a handful of spectral samples. An exception to this methodology is the Hyperspectral Diagnostic Imaging (HSDI®) instrument developed by Science and Technology International. This non-invasive device collects contiguous hyperspectral images across the entire cervical portio. The high spatial and spectral resolution of the HSDI instruments make them uniquely well suited for addressing the issues of coupled spatial and spectral variability of tissues in vivo. Analysis of HSDI data indicates that tissue spectra vary from point to point, even within histopathologically homogeneous regions. This spectral variability exhibits both random and patterned components, implying that point monitoring may be susceptible to significant sources of noise and clutter inherent in the tissue. We have analyzed HSDI images from clinical CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) patients to quantify the spatial variability of fluorescence and reflectance spectra. This analysis shows the spatial structure of images to be fractal in nature, in both intensity and spectrum. These fractal tissue textures will limit the performance of any point-monitoring technology.","","Conference paper","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus"

Originally based on luminance contrast only, there is now interest in false color multispectral imaging in selected spectral bands to improve tissue differentiation. Some success has been achieved, but the scientific basis for the results was unknown. This research is concerned with measurements of the diffuse transmittance of breast tissues as a function of wavelength in the 600â1060 nm range (and calculations of contrast with a one dimensional diffusion theory model). Carcinoma and glandular tissues were found to have similar spectral transmittances with an increase in transmittance between 750 and 900 nm, and an absorption window around 960 nm. Adipose tissue showed a distinct transmittance minimum at 930 nm. In vivo measurement of an intact normal breast showed a minimum at about 825 nm, as yet unexplained. The transmittance data and reflectance data were used to derive the scattering and absorption coefficients. The diffusion length was also determined from radiance versus depth measurements. These coefficients were used for calculations of contrast in a one dimensional slab model, with and without a layer of cancerous tissue positioned between two slabs of normal tissue. © 1983, American Institute of Physics for the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Abnormal areas are visualized as transient white patches and there are several evidences that acetic acid-tissue interaction kinetics is correlated with the malignancy grade. The visual assessment of this interaction can not be effective and therefore the obtained diagnostic information is limited. In this paper a new method and a multi-spectral imaging system are presented, capable to enhance the contrast between normal and acetic acid responsive tissue areas and to assess quantitatively the kinetics of acetic acid-tissue interaction. The former is achieved by cutting-off the regular reflection, in combination with the selection of the appropriate imaging spectral band. The second is achieved with the dynamic measurement of the intensity of the back-scattered light in any spatial point of the image, after acetic acid application. The obtained quantitative data provide a means for the early detection, and more accurate grading and mapping of the lesion.

This study involves a series of 534 patients with 573 cutaneous pigmented lesions (132 melanomas and 441 nonmelanoma lesions). Each lesion was analyzed by a telespectrophotometric system (TS) in vivo, before surgery. The system is able to acquire a set of 17 images at selected wavelengths from 400 to 1040 nm. For each wavelength, five lesion descriptors were extracted, related to the criteria of the ABCD (for asymmetry, border, color, and dimension) clinical guide for melanoma diagnosis. These variables were first reduced in dimension by the use of factor analysis techniques and then used as input data in an ANN. Multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA) was also performed on the same dataset. The whole dataset was split into two independent groups: i.e., train (the first 400 cases, 95 melanomas) and verification set (last 173 cases, 37 melanomas). Factor analysis was able to summarize the data structure into ten variables, accounting for at least 90% of the original parameters variance. After proper training, the ANN was able to classify the population with 80% sensitivity, 72% specificity, and 78% sensitivity, 76% specificity for the train and validation set, respectively. Following ROC analysis, area under curve (AUC) was 0.852 (train) and 0.847 (verify).

The problem with alginate-made dressings in surgery is their slow biodegradability: if entrapped within tissues, they can induce a local cellular recruitment with an inflammatory response contemporaneous to the resorption phase. In part, this problem is a consequence of poor solubility of the calcium alginates in water. Although calcium alginate fibers can exchange calcium ions with sodium ions from the wound exudate to create a calcium/sodium alginate fibers, the residual alginates are thought to be not totally degradable in vivo. Rapid and non-destructive characterization of series of the crude alginates and calcium alginate fibers has been performed using Raman spectroscopy with near infrared excitation. Study of structural organization of the polymeric chains within calcium alginate fibers have been previously reported as made by confocal Raman multispectral imaging (CRMSI) in visible. Here, the Raman approach has been used to monitor the ion exchange reactions for different types of alginates and their salts in vitro. For in vivo evaluation, histological sections of alginate-treated rat tissue have been analyzed by light microscopy and CRMSI. The in vitro Raman modeling and the histochemical mapping were a necessary precursor for application of the Raman microprobe to follow in a non-invasive way the alginate-cell molecular interactions in rat tissue.","Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Real-time images of the dermis are acquired both at multiple, contiguous wavelengths and at relatively narrow spectral bandwidths to generate a data cube consisting of one spectral and two spatial dimensions. For data collection, the sample area is illuminated by radiation, which is delivered by liquid light guides from a quartz tungsten halogen (QTH) source. Reflected light from the sample is first passed through a liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF) and then imaged onto a silicon charged coupled device (CCD) detector. The subsequently digitized data are presented in terms of spectral images reflecting multivariate least squares analyses based upon linear combinations of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin reference spectra. The generated gray scale images directly represent the varying spatial distributions of dermal tissue oxygenation. As an example, imaging data are obtained from normal tissue and induced ischemic tissue for which both the venous and arterial blood flow was artificially occluded.","Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers","Conference paper","","Scopus"

The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of reliable discrimination between early MM and AMN with noninvasive, objective, automatic machine vision techniques. Methods: A data base of 104 digitized dermoscopic color transparencies of melanocytic lesions was used to develop and test our computer-based algorithms for classification of such lesions as malignant (MM) or benign (AMN). Histopathologic diagnoses (30 MM and 74 AMN) were used as the 'gold standard' for training and testing the algorithms. Results: A fully automatic, objective technique for differentiating between early MM and AMN from their dermoscopic digital images was developed. The multiparameter linear classifier was trained to provide 100% sensitivity for MM. In the blind test, this technique did not miss a single MM and its specificity was comparable to that of skilled dermatologists. Conclusions: Reliable differentiation between early MM and AMN with high sensitivity is possible using machine vision techniques to analyze digitized dermoscopic lesion images.","","Article","","Scopus"

We used a multispectral tissue segmentation analysis. Three sets of MRI data were included: proton density, T2-weighted fast spin echo, and T1- weighted spin echo, as inputs. Three image preprocessing steps included correcting image nonuniformity, application of an anisotropic diffusion type filter, and data point selection by a qualified observer. We used the k- Nearest Neighbor segmentation algorithm, which does not require prior knowledge of the sample distribution. This choice allowed us to optimize the different tissue clusters present in three-dimensional (3D) feature space. In vivo validation of the technique was performed in hamsters harboring tumors induced with JC virus-transformed HJC-15 cells, as compared to three control animals. Human brain tumors obtained by stereotactically guided biopsy in six patients were also included in the study. Finally, brain tumors were removed from two patients who underwent conventional craniotomy using segmentation- derived images as a guide. In the hamsters, 10 tissues were correctly identified by segmentation and were confirmed histologically (P < .02). In the patients, there was also a strong correlation between our segmentation results and the tissue obtained by stereotactic biopsy (P < .01). In one of the two patients who underwent open craniotomy, segmentation images were useful in revealing tumor spread into vital areas of the brain (motor area). In conclusion, the results of segmentation correlate well with the tissues in vivo and thus warrant further clinical utilization and evaluation.","","Article","","Scopus"

Using these techniques no sample preparation is necessary for PIR- fiber probes to measure reflection and absorption spectra, in situ, in vivo, in real time and even multiplexed. Such PIR-fiber probes have been used for evanescent absorption spectroscopy of malignant tissue and skin surface diagnostics in-vivo, glucose detection in blood as well as crude oil composition analysis, for organic pollution and nuclear waste monitoring.

The synergy of PIR-fibers flexibility with a super high resolution of TDL spectrometers with (Delta) v equals 10-4 cm-1, provides the unique tool for gas analysis, specifically when PIR-fibers are coupled as pigtails with MCT-detectors, and Pb-salt lasers.

Additionally, separation of certain parts of the hippocampus from the adjacent brain structures on MR images is sometimes very difficult. These difficulties have led most investigators to either use arbitrary landmarks or to exclude certain parts of the structure from their measurements. Based on three-dimensional MR data, we have developed a reliable in vivo volumetric measurement of the human hippocampus. In contrast to most of the previously described volumetric MR-based methods, we aimed to sample the entire hippocampal formation using its true anatomical definition. This was accomplished by relying on the capacity of the BRAINS software to simultaneously visualize in multiple planes, to ""telegraph"" tracings or cursor position from one plane to another, and to simultaneously rely on multispectral data from three different image sets (T1, T2, and tissue classified). The methods for identifying boundaries and measuring the hippocampal volume are described. The method has excellent reliability, sensitivity, and specificity. The method may be of use in studies of structure-function relationships in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, temporal lobe epilepsy, and Alzheimer's disease. Future work will use these measurements as training data for a neural net-based technique to identify the anatomical boundaries automatically.","","Article","","Scopus"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate differential contrast-weighted images, specifically a multispectral MR technique, to improve the accuracy of identifying the lipid-rich necrotic core and acute intraplaque hemorrhage in vivo. Methods and Results - Eighteen patients scheduled for carotid endarterectomy underwent a preoperative carotid MRI examination in a 1.5-T GE Signa scanner using a protocol that generated 4 contrast weightings (T1, T2, proton density, and 3D time of flight). MR images of the vessel wall were examined for the presence of a lipid-rich necrotic core and/or intraplaque hemorrhage. Ninety cross sections were compared with matched histological sections of the excised specimen in a double-blinded fashion. Overall accuracy (95% CI) of multispectral MRI was 87% (80% to 94%), sensitivity was 85% (78% to 92%), and specificity was 92% (86% to 98%). There was good agreement between MRI and histological findings, with a value of κ=0.69 (0.53 to 0.85). Conclusions - Multispectral MRI can identify the lipid-rich necrotic core in human carotid atherosclerosis in vivo with high sensitivity and specificity. This MRI technique provides a noninvasive tool to study the pathogenesis and natural history of carotid atherosclerosis. Furthermore, it will permit a direct assessment of the effect of pharmacological therapy, such as aggressive lipid lowering, on plaque lipid composition.","Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","Article","","Scopus"

The catheter in this system consists of a coherent fiber-optic imaging bundle, a miniature objective, and a focus mechanism. The proximal end of the catheter is coupled to a slit-scan confocal microscope so that high-resolution fluorescence images of cells and tissue microstructure can be viewed in real-time. The performance of the microendoscope is limited by the characteristics of the fiber bundle. The lateral resolution of the system is 1.8 microns and the axial resolution is 25 microns. The field of view is 430 microns. The maximum imaging depth, is around 200 microns below the tissue surface, but this depends on the tissue properties and wavelength range of operation. The slit-scan confocal microscope allows both gray-scale imaging at 8 frames per second and multi-spectral imaging. The frame rate in the multi-spectral imaging mode is determined by the number of spectral channels. The system has been demonstrated using topically-administered exogenous fluorescence dyes in excised tissues and in vivo animal models. A new catheter is under development with a maximum diameter of 3mm, which will allow it to be routed through the therapeutic instrument channel of a conventional clinical endoscope, making the device practical for routine clinical use. © 2002 IEEE.","IEEE Computer Society","Conference paper","","Scopus"

Particular emphasis has been placed on the problem of developing a pattern recognition system for noninvasively identifying the different plaque classes involved in atherogenesis using minimal a priori information. A rapid 3-D display system is also described for the simultaneous display of multiple data classes resulting from the tissue identification process. The results of this work provide a high-information-content display, which will aid in the diagnosis and analysis of the atherosclerotic disease process, and permit detailed and quantitative studies to assess the effectiveness of therapies, such as drug, exercise, and dietary regimens.","Publ by IEEE","Conference paper","","Scopus"

PIR-fiber cables and probes could be coupled with a variety of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and Tunable Diode Lasers (TDL), including pig tailing of Mercury Cadmium Tellurium (MCT) detectors. Using these techniques no sample preparation is necessary for PIR-fiber probes to measure reflection and absorption spectra, in situ, in vivo, in real time and even multiplexed. Such PIR-fiber probes have been used for evanescent absorption spectroscopy of malignant tissue and skin surface diagnostics in-vivo, glucose detection in blood as well as crude oil composition analysis, for organic pollution and nuclear waste monitoring. A review of various PIR-fiber applications in medicine, industry and environment control is presented. The synergy of PIR-fibers flexibility with a super high spectral resolution of TDL spectrometers with Δv=10-4 cm -1, provides the unique tool for gas analysis, specifically when PIR-fibers are coupled as pigtails with MCT- detectors and Pb-salt lasers. Design of multichannel PIR-fiber tailed TDL spectrometer could be used as a portable device for multispectral gas analysis at 1ppb level of detectivity for various applications in medicine and biotechnology.","SPIE","Conference paper","","Scopus"
